<div><i>Have Heep and Fangles met their match this time?</i>
<p class=drop>A scorched black stain spread across the
metal transmission sheet.
The edges of the stain continued to run outwards as the metal area at
its centre grew thinner, until, with a creak and a sharp, small pop, it
corroded into a ragged hole. Then, with the edges of the hole glowing
orange and hissing with a miniscule yet ravenous hunger, the hole began
to spread and spread and spread&#133; </P>
<P>Heep was holding the sheet gingerly at the edges, as if it were made
of gossamer or spider&#146;s-web, trying not to pull it taut in order to
avoid breaking it. She scratched the dark red cartilage surface of her
brow with one pointed, metallic antler and sighed. The transmission
sheet
was made of gold-plated aluminium and was two
inches thick, yet the hole at its centre had now grown so large that
she could push her head through it, and she hadn&#146;t the slightest clue
what was causing it.</P>
<P>A bilious nasal grumble issued from somewhere behind her as Fangles
sniffed the air. He asked her if things were still burning and she
answered that yes,
Fangles, things were still burning, and that, actually, they&#146;re
speeding up, thanks for asking. Never a fan of sarcasm, Fangles blew
bubbles out of his trunks and
showed Heep his arse.</P>
<P>The sky seemed to be contracting around them both. A raw, pulsating
sky laced and lined with long drifts of capillary clouds.  Hot brown
rain dripped through the air. The ionosphere had appeared to be at
least five miles above them a day ago, but now it was surely more like
one. The world was closing in around them like a mouth.</P>
<P>Heep watched as the slender circuit of sizzling flame seemed to leap
off the disintegrating metal sheet like an incendiary flea, landed on
the slanted alloy side wall of their buggy, grazing redly in zigzags
and spirals.</P>
<P>The fire had already scored its way across their tents and their
relay antenna (cutting <I>that</I> down like a hacked sapling), and as
Heep followed its progress with a clinical gaze, Fangles emitted an
explosive bellow as a hot fizzle of flame began to bore out an inch
deep crater in his left flank.</P>
<P>And surrounding them, in a perfect circle, ushering tails of dirty
yellowing smoke into the clammy air, flames flickered up sharply like
shards of glass embedded in the  ground. Heep dragged the
communications box from the rags of her tent and whirled the dials to
produce a momentum signal. She clicked the heavy brass switches and
consulted her pocketbook, flipping in vain through the pages.</P>
<P><I>Rapley</I>, she thought, <I>we must ring Rapley.</I></P>
<P>But oddly, neither of them had his number.</P>
<P class=drop>A moth flattered the toilet light bulb with its
inconsiderable
attention. Wings flapping in a blur like pygmy sails, proboscis jabbing
and tapping at the heated, translucent plastic. Moth body launching
itself in religious
fervour against
the
scriptured
legend - &#146;60 WATT&#146;.</P>
<P>Rapley felt the thrown shadow of the insect flutter and flicker
across him, blown out of all reasonable size. Its speed was the speed
of a smaller thing and was quite utterly out of place in this scaled up
human world. <I>We do things slowly here</I>, he thought. He was seated
on the throne, flicking through a rather piquant
monograph on the London sewer system.</P>
<P>An urgent ringing from the other side of the locked door
tugged at his
attention and he folded the page and performed his
<I>apr&egrave;s-toilette</I> procedures. &#145;Bertha! A simple &#145;Rapley
residence&#146; would be splendid if you could see fit.?&#146; He
opened the door and clicked off the light switch. Behind him, a moth
screeched curses of fundamentalist disappointment and religious
deprivation in tiny, inaudibly high-pitched chatter.</P>
<P>Rapley ran a bony hand through his mop of hay-coloured hair. He
languidly glided into the lounge, where Bertha lay draped over a
hanging basket chair, her small frame and unruly dark hair giving her
the appearance of a reclining feline. Bertha had made no effort to raise
herself from the chair, choosing instead to continue
writing a shopping list or work of prose fiction upon her left palm and
wrist: &#145;bricolage, pests, revivalist sculpture, some versions of me..&#146;,
it began. She looked up at Rapley through her darkly hazel hedge of a
fringe, blue eyes glinting with mystery like a nearly-solved cryptic
crossword puzzle. </P>
<P>Rapley tucked his shirt into the waistband of his corduroy drainpipes 
and lifted the mewling
receiver from the cradle. &#146;22 The Knoll.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Rapley? Violet. Developments of a mysterious bent have come to
pass. Might I suggest we meet at the Bloomsbury Bowling Alley.  The
Ramp Cinema. Dosun&#146;s closed the doors to the public just for us.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Good morning to you too. Will there be drinks?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Bring your own.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Cheap, Violet, very cheap. Shall we say an hour?&#146;</P>
<P class=drop>The dread flesh trees were swaying the meat fringes of
their
branches and chanting low incantations of sorrow. Heep had set up a
rough perimeter by smashing up every single thing she and Fangles owned
and superheating them into a fused curved wall of glass. The resulting
fence seemed to be keeping those things at bay, but their repeated
slobberings and wipings against the opaque curves had initiated a
chemical reaction of some sort. Acidic weepings from their trunks
and tendrils were bubbling against the glass, destructive saliva eating
through the screen, slowly but unstoppably.</P>
<P>The apparitions of flesh and branch had risen from the soggy sand so
swiftly that Fangles and Heep had at first assumed that they had always
been there, just peripherally unnoticed. However, a quick visual sweep
of the terrain revealed legions of them slurping and hoisting
themselves from the mulching ground, like unwanted prizes unearthing
themselves gruesomely from a vast tombola.</P>
<P>Fangles had taken this idea on board and was currently attempting to
dig through the sand beneath his hooves. Shovelling with his trunk and
scraping with his horns. Stamping with rage every time he hit a fresh
bed of undiggable rock.</P>
<P>Heep looked up at the sky once more and raised both antlers into the
air, sensing and processing the air currents and wind fallows. The sky
was most definitely lowering, forcing the gusts of atmospheric wind
into harsher, more concentrated jets.. but, also, the horizon was
stretching, lengthening without receding into the curve of any known
rounded planet. She could see into the distance further than the eye
could see, and the vertigo of it all ensured that she remained seated,
hands firmly on the ground, her head swimming with the impossibility of
it all.</P>
<P>&#145;Fangles?&#146; she sighed. &#145;do we have a Plan B?&#146;</P>
<P class=drop>Rapley tapped the glass with his knuckles. There was a
general
stoppered rumble of voices from within and a rustle and clinking of
things.</P>
<P>The glass pane of the Bowling Alley&#146;s front door was bottle-thick,
and Rapley and Bertha peered closer as a face-shaped form
loomed up to the other side of the pane. The dappled glass sent
his face into small curved crescents, but it was unmistakably Mr
Violet&#146;s gimlet eyes and buffalo moustache.</P>
<P>Raindrops dribbled down the pane, Violet mouthed a muffled hello and
yanked the door inwards.</P>
<P>&#145;Marvellous, marvellous. And Bertha! Rather a day for it. Won&#146;t
you..?&#146;</P>
<P>The small compact man known to Pasha Rapley as 'my dearest friend and
largest compensation for living in this wretched festival of bone-idle
humanity' waggled his moustache and invited them inside. Mr Violet was
dressed in his usual outift of rough brown tweed two-piece suit,
knitted tie and brothel creepers. The breast pocket of his jacket was
lined with pens, each one different, each liberated from bookies,
banks or post offices.</P>
<P>They trotted wetly into the Ramp Cinema, which served as the
entrance hall of the Bloomsbury Bowling Alley. It consisted merely of a
long, thin room and a declining floor,
which had the effect of tipping it&#146;s inhabitants downwards towards a
door at the other end. </P>
<P>On the far wall hung a wobbly projection screen, dusted with web and
grime. Short rows of seats filled the left hand side of the room, and it
was onto these that the two newcomers clung to avoid the comical
freefall which gravity was strongly recommending to their bodies.</P>
<P>&#145;Ah, Mr Rapley!&#146; boomed a fruity and familiar voice from a lower and
more shadowed row. &#145;And wet companion! Welcome, welcome, pull up a pew,
divest yourself of worldly troubles and feel free to smoke..&#146;</P>
<P>A chubby, round, florid face bobbed from the shadows like ten pounds
of raw ham. Three grey steel-wool clouds of hair tufted briskly from the
centre
of the crown and above the ears. Fat, blueing bags wobbled under the
tea-coloured eyes, and a multitude of chins expressed their eloquent
doubts about healthy eating.</P>
<P>&#145;Dosun.&#146; Nodded Rapley with an absence of warmth.</P>
<P>&#145;Dosun.&#146; Said Bertha, experimentally. Toying with the cadences of
the name in the same way a cat might chew a mouse&#146;s tail for the heck
of it.</P>
<P>Clothed in a thick three-piece sack of claret corduroy, Dosun
bustled along the row of seats, waggling his fingers in the air like a
deluded pianist. &#145;Things are afoot, Pasha. Bears stalk the woods and I
allude here
not to yellow teddies with buttons for eyes.&#146;</P>
<P>The smallest of sooty coughs came from the furthest, deepest corner
of the slanting room. A woman of middling years and an erect, hawklike
aspect stepped forward into the light. Buckled shoes, a wigwam of white
hair streaked with a yellowing of nicotine, a dress suit of dull green,
like darkness seen through a wine bottle. She could have been a
cashier, she could have been a traitor.</P>
<P>&#145;Mr Rapley? My name is Catherine Paranda. I represent The Interior,
and we need your help.&#146;</P>
<P>Pasha sat daintily on the armrest of a chair and sipped a
cigarette. &#145;The Interior..&#146; he sighed. &#145;Oh, bugger. Tell me, Catherine.
What
rich seam of swivel-eyed incompetence have you and your colleagues in
the Ministry been mining now?&#146;</P>
<P>Dosun spluttered, growing ruddier and boxing the air with the tiny
meatballs of his fists. &#145;Blarney! Faff! Drivel! Stop it, sir! Represent me! You weren&#146;t too
proud to assist  them before, Rapley!&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley languidly stretched his arms out wide, following this with
the most theatrical of yawns. Bertha copied him, her gawping mouth
opening like a basking shark&#146;s.</P>
<P>&#145;I was exceptionally bored, and had run out of books to read, I seem
to remember.&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Violet snuffled a reminiscent laugh. &#145;The Affair of the Haunted Particle Accelerator.  A real tangle,
that one..&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Nearly fried in that second Big Bang, Violet, old son.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Thank god for your key to the Underverse; sweeping all that
radiation under the carpet was a masterstroke.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Yes, but what breed of supermonsters are, even as we speak,
breeding in supermassive black hole XS-897.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Can&#146;t be worse than the Faberg&eacute; Beast!&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Or the Trehemoth!&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Or the Marvellous Marjoram Mouse!&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Oh heavens, no!&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Gentlemen.&#146; said Catherine Paranda, flicking her thumb
absentmindedly against a brooch on her lapel, as if it were a sheriff&#146;s
badge. &#145;Memory Lane must wait. Dosun? Is the girl cleared? May I speak
freely?&#146;</P>
<P>Dosun shuffled towards Bertha and peered at her closely, inches from
her face, squeezing one eye tightly shut to increase the incisive
perspicacity of his character judgements. He waved a hand in the air and swayed back to his seat, swatting
flies that weren&#146;t there. &#145;Oh probably, probably, don&#146;t you know, one of Rapley&#146;s, should be
hrumphumphumph..&#146;</P>
<P>Bertha leant her head to one side and smiled with wet eyes, as if
this were the sweetest thing she&#146;d ever heard. She may even have
written him a poem.</P>
<P>&#145;As you know, we in The Interior run things. I shouldn&#146;t need to
qualify the &#145;things&#146; we run, but I will. The city operates like
clockwork due to our hands on the keys. A balance has been created
between the various currents and strata operating in or flowing
through the city. If a Starburger closes on Mare St, we significantly
lower the hygiene standards of the toilets in The Garrick club. If a
wolf escapes from London Zoo and gnashes its way through the squirrels
of Regent&#146;s Park, we release the Black Cat into the streets of South
London again to graze on however many mongrels and tabbies it can stuff
down it&#146;s throat. If it rains on Tuesday, we&#146;ll make damnably sure the
sun is radiant on Friday.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Except during Wimbledon fortnight! Ha!&#146; guffawed Dosun,
greasily.</P>
<P>&#145;Don&#146;t burble, Dosun, it&#146;s unseemly.&#146; said Rapley without looking at
him. &#145;Continue.&#146;</P>
<P>Paranda took a seat. &#145;Ordered variety, in short. A balance, as I say, but one that isn&#146;t
so obviously ordered that it is detectable. If people knew the extent
of our work..Well, they don&#146;t. That&#146;s enough for us. My point is, we keep 
things ticking along. Everyone playing their
parts. A balance.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley tapped his heels against the chair legs. &#145;My lack of sympathy 
with your task is almost biblical. Get to the
point, if point you possess. I&#146;m missing a rather good documentary
about otters for this.&#146;</P>
<P>Catherine Paranda made a church from her fingers and rested the
steeple upon her nose. &#145;We have a governing body, a select circle within The Interior.
Their influence upon events is impossible to overstate. Magisterial..?
No no..&#146; She crinkled her eyes shut and almost gasped with the pain of
it all. </P>
<P>Bertha looked at Mr Violet and mouthed &#145;Is she ok in the head&#146;. Mr
Violet cupped a hand around his lips and mouthed &#145;Not really&#146;.</P>
<P>Paranda shook the moment off and continued. &#145;They think things, and
they come true. They predict and analyse and
intuitively project. It is almost as if they are reading the future
from an autocue.&#146; Paranda pulled at the hem of her dress.&#145;They make the 
city dance. It&#146;s a happy mixture of genes and
background and nurtured abilities, of course. Plucked from their
provincial nests as children, or sometimes noticed at school or
university, they have been chosen for their psychical broadcast
strengths and the cast-iron infallibility of their persuasive
psychologies. They are both tools and operators. Above human, and
therefore quite utterly what humanity needs in a gentle shepherd.&#146; </P>
<P>Dosun spread his fingers out like sunrays and held his hands, palms
upwards, underneath his eyes. &#145;They are a prism. They refract the
future.&#146; He whispered
reverently.</P>
<P>&#145;Yes, yes&#146; muttered Rapley, looking up at the ceiling. &#145;So this
council is made up of people whose sensitivity to trends, fashions and
possible future obstacles to your much-vaunted notion of stability is
such that they can anticipate and eliminate nasty surprises for you.
They can read the runes, pick through the headlines, the graffiti,
taste the data soup in the atmosphere and then psychically project the
wishes of The Interior and manifest these wishes as actual, observable
behavioural differences.&#146;</P>
<P>He stopped to take a breath. Violet lit three cigarettes and handed
them round.</P>
<P>&#145;Something of that nature,&#146; smirked Paranda. &#145;You make it sound
almost fascistic.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley glared at her through twirling horns of exhaled cigarette
smoke. &#145;The point?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Ah. It actually concerns a couple of friends of yours. You see, one
of the council had not been well for some time. Neurasthenic anyway,
the mental pressures of the job are rather intense, he recently had
something of a breakdown. Absolutely cracked, but with signs of
extraordinary mental activity detected by our CAT scans. We have
contingencies for all occasions, of course, and so we sent in a couple
of specialist housecleaners to scrub and dust and blow the cobwebs
away, so to speak. Repair any fractures they could find.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;In? You sent them in?&#146; said Bertha. &#145;In where? In him? Are they
very small?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;&#146;Not small!&#146; interjected Dosun. &#145;It&#146;s done by projection. Sort of.
We magnify and expand the mental territory and then project by means of
synaptical bridges. We map the bridges through linkages of electricity,
then-&#145;</P>
<P>&#145;Then they say a few spells and send in the troops.&#146; Rapley turned to
Paranda. &#145;And what happened?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;The mind turned cannibal. Closed in on them and hemmed them in with
madness. Our people are trapped in an entirely insane mental territory.
And since this mental territory is the creation of a psychic genius who
currently has a hissing snake&#146;s heart where his cognitive reasoning
should be, it&#146;s slightly different from the sort of spring-cleaning job
we&#146;re normally equipped for.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;This councillor with the cracked lightbulb for a brain, you say
he&#146;s some sort of thought radiator?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Yes, in crude layman&#146;s terms.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Is he conscious?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;No, comatose.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;And if he wakes, and is still afflicted by mental imbalance?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;He&#146;ll project. And will change the city. I would imagine, given his
history, at the very least the river will fill with bile, Big Ben will
throb and ejaculate, all  mothers will turn feral, the ravens will eat
the Tower. There will be more.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;And if you kill him, your people are dead?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Quite. And they&#146;re rather good. Not expendable. But, more
importantly, this prismic individual is irreplaceable. We shan&#146;t kill
him.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Friends of mine, you said?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Heep. Heep and Fangles.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Ah.&#146; </P>
<P>Rapley looked at Mr Violet.</P>
<P>&#145;Ah,&#146; said Violet.</P>
<P>&#145;For the first time,&#146; said Rapley, doing up his tie and flexing his
shoulders, &#145;in this long and sorry afternoon, you have our full and
undivided attention.&#146; </P>
<P class = drop>A slurry of spittoon-rinse rain smattered against Heep&#146;s
tin head.
Her eyes looked like snails anyway, but this atmospheric assault sent
them writhing into the devil&#146;s own molluscs. They seemed to coil in
anger.</P>
<P>Fangles was having his own problems. Several hundredweights of rain
had matted his shaggy fur, doubling his body mass until he felt as if
walking were akin to attempting an escape from an event horizon.</P>
<P>The undulating ground tongued their feet and hooves.</P>
<P>They had broken out of their precarious glass perimeter some minutes
earlier, chomping and hacking and splintering the fleshy bark of the
arboreal guards using hoof and claw and thin, tin fingers.</P>
<P>A spiteful howl blitzkrieged through the air, a deviant, entirely
sexual throb pulsed and drummed through the landscape and time seemed
to eat its own tail.</P>
<P>They had been moving slowly but purposefully through the red rain
and the scorching winds for hours, but it had only been three minutes
at the most since their lunge for freedom. Fangles and Heep both had
the unsettling feeling that someone was moulding existence like
plasticine &#150; movement, time, thoughts, bodies and all. There was a
pressure to everything. Lightning flashed from above. An obscene
giggle tickled their ears.</P>
<P>But there, ahead of them, looming nonsensically, they saw an old,
grey-green filing cabinet with swing-open doors. Standing tall and
proud, pummelled and draped with great sloshes of water, it looked
positively sea-bound. </P>
<P>Fangles shook his waterlogged mane in slow motion, summoned all his
monstrous strength and opened his mouth to speak. Three pints of
brownish liquid spilled out. &#145;..Will we fit..?&#146; he said. </P>
<P> &#145;If we don&#146;t&#146;,  spluttered Heep, &#145; You&#146;re on your own, son.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Can&#146;t leave you, Heep. You wouldn&#146;t last a minute.&#146; He blew vast
snotty bubbles of rain from his nostrils. &#145;You&#146;ve got all the street
nous of a work of brass filigree.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;We&#146;ll fit.&#146;</P>
<P>They slithered to the door and yanked it open against the airborne
tide.</P>
<P class=drop>Urns of boiling incense puffed magenta smoke into the Ramp
Cinema;
sticks of jasmine fluted thin jets of hissing, scented steam into the
air. Dosun and Paranda, both stripped to the waist and bedaubed in smudgy
glyphs and sigils, chanted low drones of a Latin flavour. Paranda pressed 
a button on the wall and the grubby projector screen
lowered falteringly, whirring with old age.</P>
<P>The three travellers re-entered the room.</P>
<P>Mr Violet had changed into a rough safari suit and ragged pith
helmet, &#145;Penge Or Bust&#146; scrawled on the side of the millinery in faded
chalk.</P>
<div class=pullquote>&#145;Into the snakepit!&#146; shouted Violet with a
grin</div><P>Bertha had chosen moonboots and a large metallic-blue
fur-lined
parka jacket. Grey fur. Bright orange lining. Mittens on strings.</P>
<P>And Rapley? Rapley had donned black leather gloves but otherwise
remained unchanged &#150; the brown corduroy trousers, the red plastic
mackintosh, a collapsible umbrella sticking out of his pocket like a
jutting hipbone.</P>
<P>Rapley picked up a canvas bag containing sandwiches, thermos and Mr
Violet&#146;s small, black revolver. &#145;Time we were off.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Hrffrffrrghhh?&#146; said Bertha.</P>
<P>Rapley leant forward and unzipped the hood of her parka.</P>
<P>&#145;I said, will this work, Pash?&#146;</P>
<P>They all glanced at the projector screen with cocked eyebrows. Dark
forms had begun to coalesce. Scratched celluloid jumped and razored
images of a throbbing landscape, red rain, dripping flesh, smashed
glass, a ripped and ruined tent. Rapley slung the bag over his shoulder, sighed and walked towards the
screen with long strides. &#145;It&#146;ll work. What&#146;s the worst that could happen? We walk into the
wall and look like idiots.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Oh, perish the thought.&#146; Said Bertha, looking down at her oversized
coat and drooping mittens.</P>
<P>Dosun was mooing to the ceiling, hands shining sunrays once more.
Paranda, eyes closed, drew keys in the air with a sparking magnesium
match.</P>
<P>&#145;Into the snakepit!&#146; shouted Violet with a grin as he, Rapley and
Bertha hit the screen running and, with a shuddering jumpcut and a jerk
of reality, found themselves within a lunatic.</P>
<P class=drop>Fangles and Heep: a sodden, many-limbed tumbleweed of fang
and
snout, tinplate and shaggy hide, washed up inside a filing cabinet
surprisingly commodious for a mirage. The gradual unwinding of arm and
foot and twisted necks began, with
many a shuffle and growl and curses upon their respective mothers. A
pair of back paws cycled with impossible speed and lethally blurred
claws, but going nowhere, tunnelling holes out of the air without
gaining purchase. </P>
<P>&#145;Fucking. Move.&#146; They both spat at the same time, one word each.</P>
<P>Fangles spun his head around a full rotation, grinding out a serving
of aggression like a furry pepperpot. Heep hissed at the beast and her
antlers jigged arhythmically, like
weightless, bladed static.</P>
<P>They unfolded and sat, drained and soggy as used teabags. A
harsh battering of water still drummed from outside. The rain&#146;s
shadows seemed to reach into the cabinet, as if dancing through glass.
Everything glowed a sickly green.</P>
<P>Fangles and Heep looked around.</P>
<P>They were squashed into a corner, shelves at their backs. But
everywhere they looked had a corner. Was a corner. A refraction of
geometry and logic, an Escher print of shifting perspective and
inverted perception. </P>
<P>For instance, Fangles stared into the corner of a deep, deep shelf.
Yet that corner had a corner above it, which you sort of felt you had
to tilt your head to look at properly, but then there was a corner to
the left of that corner, which you kind of knew was actually upside
down and in front of the corner it was behind. It spiralled, and you
spiralled with it. And there was a spider scuttling around in a
corkscrewing motion, hopping from corner to corner, but you couldn&#146;t
actually be sure whether it was a spider or a very black, spindly
elephant half a mile away showing alarming signs of unnatural
athleticism.</P>
<P>Fangles, his head twisting round and upside down till it appeared to
be deforming and melting in a fairground mirror, bellowed once, then
fainted on the floor with a sound like a whale falling into a skip. Heep
reached her serrated fingers into the shaded recesses of the
nearest shelf with the express intention of rifling through a stack of
closely typed papers. With a crack to rival the birth of a universe,
she shot through the metal partition, tumbling into the green void of
uncertainty beyond, her body twisting like a kite.</P>
<P>The gruff, snuffling animal opened his eyes into a whooshing visual
smear. His peripheral vision was a writhing, dancing carnival of a
place as his hurtling body rushed forward at fireball speeds. A world was 
flashing past him, present steaming into the past at an
astonishing pace. He forced his eyes wider against the pressure and
stared into the future. </P>
<P>He was seated in another green cabinet, supine against the back as
it slid like a toboggan down a rickety wooden railway track, sparks
flying from the smouldering back edges of the cabinet, their trace
tracks forming cat&#146;s whiskers in the air. Ahead of him, more track,
dipping and looping and glowing the
blackest of reds, a twisting helix ember burnt down to the core of
things.</P>
<P>He blinked his fat, heavy eyes. The matted bags underneath them
wrinkled like mouldy concertinas.</P>
<P>The cabinet swooped and corkscrewed. More sparks flew and a section
of track behind him puffed like a fingered spore and was gone.</P>
<P>He stared down at his claws and shanks, then prodded his massive
face experimentally. </P>
<P>What was his name again?</P>
<P>&#145;FAAAAAANNNNNGLLLESSSSS&#146;</P>
<P>The flabby and bemused creature looked up as a screech zipped
overhead, a zooming disembodied voice whipping from right to left
carried in a hurtling tin carriage which rattled precariously along on
its own arcing set of track.</P>
<P>Was that some new cuss word? Some harsh and abusive oath? He felt
reasonably sure he knew them all, and that was a new one on him. </P>
<P>&#145;FAAANNNNGGGLEEESSSSSS&#146;</P>
<P>The voice missiled across underneath him and he leant a bristled and
whiskered cheek against the lip of the cabinet, his jowls dripping over
the edge like congealing custard.</P>
<div class=pullquote>The atmosphere like hot coals against their
cheeks</div><P>It was a tin lady with knives for fingers and raw, red
skin on
her
face like some ornate Mexican wrestler&#146;s mask. He used to wrestle,
didn&#146;t he? He seemed to remember they always looked at him with shock,
horror and awe. Asking him incredulously to take off his own mask, his
body suit, the weaponry or bladed gloves upon his hands. But there
weren&#146;t any. It was all him. Then.. then what?</P>
<P>&#145;YOU ARE POMPADOUR ALOYSIUS FANGLES III-&#145;</P>
<P>Oh, he couldn&#146;t keep up with this noisy ruckus. It was like being
stalked by a malfunctioning car alarm. The cabinet careered over a set
of points, lurching him from side to side.</P>
<P>&#145;RAVENOUS MAJOR IN EXEGESIS OF THE SEVENTH ARMED CARNAL, HYPERIOTIC
SPACE MALOUCHE-&#145;</P>
<P>The tin lady arced again like a burnt rainbow across his head.  His
brain throbbed. He needed a drink. He needed to be tucked up in &#145;The
Hat and Feathers&#146; on the Israel Road with Gibbs, with Helmholtz, the
floor littered with reddened corks. He-</P>
<P>&#145;VIOLENCE! THINK ABOUT VIOLENCE AND MAGIC! ABOUT DICE AND GUITAR
STRINGS AND LUCKY HORSESHOES AND MERMAIDS!&#146;</P>
<P><I>Mermaids? Neptune&#146;s daughters? Brine and sweat and turmoil in the
water? A thrashing vortex of foam and undertow? Love in the ocean?
Seven brides for seven beasts for seven seas? His girls in every port?
His. He. Him. Heep?</I></P>
<P>&#145;Heep?&#146; Fangles stopped rubbing himself and peered down at the
whizzing tin figure. &#145;Fuck you doing? Where are we?&#146;</P>
<P><I>Right</i>, he thought, <I>quite enough of this pussyfooting.</i>
He raised
himself up onto his mighty haunches against the scathing velocities and
crashed his back paws straight through the cabinet floor, splintering
metal and screws. His paws cracked through the burning wood tracks like
an anchor. In an instant the entire carriage whipcracked onto its end.
Fangles stood still, rooted to the tracks and the metal floor tore
around him as it upended, leaving a ragged body-shaped hole.</P>
<P>He swayed for a while as the zinging and crunching sounds receded
from his hearing, then he opened his eyes and picked the bits of metal
from his hide.</P>
<P>&#145;FAAANNNGG-&#145;</P>
<P>Fangles instinctively threw a paw towards the blur of sound and
scooped Heep from her speeding carriage. She dangled there, held by one
tin leg. Sparks in the air. The atmosphere like hot coals against their
cheeks. A droning fury of wind. </P>
<P>&#145;Down boy&#146; she said, smiling.</P>
<P>He slung her over his hunchbacked shoulders and jumped off the
disintegrating track into the crimson mists below.</P> <P><P class=drop>&#145;One might approach this with an over-zealous sense of
reassembly,&#146;
yawned Rapley as the golden Carousel horse bobbed through the scarlet
fog.</P>
<P>Above him sparks glinted in the sky like distant constellations.
There was a muffled clatter amongst the cloud tops.</P>
<P>&#145;But, from what I can see, it isn&#146;t a question of frantic surgical
repair. Rather, I feel we should concentrate on getting to the heart of
things. If a psyche can be said to have a heart, that is.&#146;</P>
<P>He drifted off vaguely, fishing a mint from his pocket.</P>
<P>Mr Violet, his feet jammed into stiff, wooden stirrups, was almost
throttling his teak steed in an effort not to fall off. The horse had
emeralds for eyes and a furred cobra for a tail, which hissed and spat
behind him.</P>
<P>The two carousel nags had swooped down casually from the air as
soon as
they had crossed over, hovering silently next to them like a taxi rank.
So they had obliged. The horses seemed to know where they were
going.</P>
<P>Mr Violet looked up into the smoiling
clouds, aware of an indistinct droning. &#145;I
feared the pressures of a hand squeezing within my soul as soon
as we materialised here, attempting to shred and then consume who I am.
Threatening my personality with its digestive enzymes. It&#146;s a good
thing I can&#146;t be bothered to actually have a personality these days.
Rather moves the goalposts for the poor man, don&#146;t you think?&#146;</P>
<P>Bertha nodded and mouthed something noncommittal. With her hands
around
Rapley&#146;s waist, she was staring open-mouthed at
the scenery. She felt herself blurring into this exquisitely brutal
territory, the edges of herself bleeding into the man&#146;s searing mental
landscape.</P>
<P>In the far distance on either side, she could see sharp ridges of
mountainous terrain. But ridges turned on their side so that they were
facing inwards towards them. Black peaks turned an ominous grey by the
fog which drifted around them in a nebulous dance; a veil of
sweet-smelling coppery gauze. </P>
<P>The fog sweated the three travellers like a volcanic sauna. Bertha
felt an insistent and distracting but not entirely unpleasant ache in
her stomach. Violet had vomited twice into his pith helmet. Rapley had
sighed and munched a cheese and tomato sandwich. &#145;If you feel yourself 
dissipating or forgetting who you are, let me
know and I&#146;ll remind you. I know disgusting secrets about the both of
you, after all, and one of them is sure to shock you back into
something approaching sentient self-awareness. Need I mention Chelsea
pensioners?&#146; </P>
<P>Here, Mr Violet paused from his regurgitation to wince and redden.
</P>
<P>&#145;Or sodomy, rum and the lash?&#146;</P>
<P>A grin flicked across Bertha&#146;s face.</P>
<P>&#145;I shall deploy them if necessary, so hang on to your egos.&#146;</P>
<P>The drone
 from above turned into a cometary roar. A bow
wave of
pressure cleared a ten foot wide gap in the mists ahead of them and a
smear of bodies crashed into the ground.</P>
<P>Not letting the dust settle, Heep popped out of the impact crater,
snapping her arm back into place, antlers shivering with the shock of
the landing. &#145;Ooooh jesus yes&#133; Rapley! Ah. Fascinating country this, but needs
demolition. Or r&eacute;gime change, certainly.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley beamed and slid off the equine, throwing a crust over his
shoulder. &#145;Heep! My regimental beauty! Perfectly simple job, this. Knew you&#146;d
screw it up.&#146;</P>
<P>Bertha hmphed and waited for an introduction.</P>
<P>A snuffling from the crater. Mr Violet scuttled to the lip, helmet
in hand like an alms bowl.</P>
<P>&#145;Oh, Pompey? Little Pompey? Refreshing soup. A broth for you after
your exertions.&#146;, he cooed.</P>
<P>A wrinkled and mud-caked trunk quivered its way out of the hole and
slopped heavily into the proffered pith helmet, slurping up the chunky
expulsion.</P>
<P>&#145;FLLAAUURRGGHHHH!&#146;</P>
<P>The pink soup fountained up into the air in a thick spray, followed
by the leaping form of Fangles, bowling Mr Violet over like a skittle.
The thrashing figures rolled and punched and kicked before coming to a
panting, guffawing halt. </P>
<P>&#145;Violet!&#146; Fangles grinned through his demented fangs. &#145;You&#146;re
dressed like Roger Moore!&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Violet ruffled his friend&#146;s fur and scratched behind one of his
huge bent ears with both hands.</P>
<P>&#145;Still ugly as sin, you wretched old hound!&#146; His moustache shook
with joy.</P>
<P>They convened as a group to the relative comfort of a raised stone
plateau. From this lofty position Rapley and Heep glared out over the
landscape. Mr Violet, Bertha and the excitable Fangles, thick tail wagging
dangerously like a flailing club, shared out tea and sandwiches and
loaded blue bullets into the stealthy, matt black revolver.</P>
<P>&#145;Calcinates&#146;, explained Heep unhelpfully, &#145;And sodium, acids of
course, variegated coagulants, vitamin mountains, beds of cancer cells,
corals of them, in fact.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley flicked an index finger down his lips, popping sounds
punctuating the list.</P>
<P>&#145;Bloods. A landscape of assorted interior quantities seamed with
blood. It&#146;s immeasurable, Rapley. How do we find a part of him nucleic
enough to do damage to?&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley clicked his heels together and whistled into the air.</P>
<P>&#145;Every time we consider ourselves to have reached a solid target, we
are either marauded by a cacophony of anguished, malignant cell
growths, or begin to lose all sense of our own selves. We need
direction! A map! An unravelled ball of twine... something!&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley drew triangles in the dust with his boot tips.</P>
<P>Heep tinked her spurs against the rocky ground. &#145;Rapley!&#146;</P>
<P>But he just peered at the triangle and mused: &#145;Scalene..?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Twerp! Listen to me!&#146; She stamped her sheet metal slippers, the claws within scratching
the tin with the briefest of hidden sparks.</P>
<P>Rapley strode to the edge of the low plateau, hands clasped tight
behind his back. He pouted and paused. Shook his head at some debate
inside his own bulbous brain. &#145;Really, Heep&#146;, he said at last, &#145;The Interior? It&#146;s beneath you. I
mean, why&#133;?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Ah,&#146; said Heep.</P>
<P>He looked around his nose at her.</P>
<P>&#145;Rapley, they offered me a laboratory. All the Bunsen burners and
tubular vascillators and basking circuitry and reiki baffles and zinc
malchemides I could ever, ever need.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley frowned at his fingernails. &#145;Still&#133;,&#146; he said, his voice clipped and hurt.</P>
<P>Heep rested the sharp fingers of one hand softly against his
cheek. &#145;You remember when I took Fangles on. You told the two of us to go
and see the worlds. All of them. And to look after each other. You
glazed that slogan onto a teapot for us: &#145;Dreams die, that&#146;s what
they&#146;re there for, just dream, don&#146;t wake up, be careful.&#146; So we have
been. And we&#146;ve tempered the excesses of The Interior wherever
possible. Me and the beast help people. From within, admittedly, but we
help. Fangles gets mermaids, did he tell you that? They love him. They
call him the Elvis Whale.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley smiled gently but his eyes disagreed. &#145;The Interior are contemptuous,&#146; 
he announced, &#145;and as dismissive and
disdainful as flamingoes. They insult the intelligence. And to be
insulted by such fascists is so degrading.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;I agree. But we&#146;re clipping its feathers bit by bit with our
patience, our damnable good moral taste and our very specific and
well-directed acts of disobedience and violence.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;A slow job. And questionable, I think. Questionable.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;The job. We must finish it, old pal.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Yes, yes. I know.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Then we&#146;ll parlay. Debate and decide.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Well, yes.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;We need to find him. Get to the brain. Turn all this off.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Of course.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Lord knows how, though.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Horses.&#146;</P>
<P>&#146;Horses?&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Oh, didn&#146;t I tell you? They said they&#146;d take us to him. He likes
the attention, you see.&#146;</P>
<P>Heep&#146;s entire body sighed. &#145;Well then why are we..? Oh, why bother..&#146; 
She turned and stomped back to the others, flicking a brace of
fingers at the smugly grinning Mr Rapley.</P>
<P>So they mounted the wooden horses, with their gaudy painted frills
and their viscous eyes like soft egg yolks bulging to the point of
collapse through their mahogany sockets.</P>
<P>Rapley and Heep, delicately side-saddled, sat on one. Bertha and the
bilious Violet atop the other. Fangles, complaining of aching knees and
churning guts, pounded along the ground beneath them under his own
considerable steam, his hide reddening with every step from the crimson
dust.</P>
<P>Rapley craned his head round to the front of his nag, ear to its
carved, pursed mouth, as it gently whispered to him. A sound blown with
the merest of pressures and efforts, like a child murmuring on the edge
of sleep. &#145;I see.&#146;, he said. And, &#145;Well, that&#146;s really awfully good of
you,&#146;</P>
<P>He patted the crest of its elaborately carved mane and turned to the
others. &#145;We go higher, apparently.&#146; he elucidated.</P>
<P>Fangles snuffled gruffly and said that was easy for you to say.</P>
<P>The horses gracefully swooped upwards, four pairs of hands grabbing
and scrabbling for purchase as a practically vertical route was chosen
into the sparking, howling sky. The rushing g-forces flapped their cheeks and billowed their
clothing like the epileptic spirits of washing lines. Bertha&#146;s head and
neck had been pushed owlishly round almost one hundred and eighty
degrees and as she struggled again to face the underbellies of the
dense nimbic formations, she caught sight of Fangles below, padding
slowly and disconsolately to a stop, panting and staring up at them
with liquid eyes. His forehead wrinkled and his jowls drooped, he
stomped a back foot, knowing it would achieve nothing. </P>
<P>Then there was a sudden change in pressure, an expulsion of fluted
air honed to a shriek of intent issuing from the wooden animal Rapley
and Bertha were clinging to.</P>
<P>The moment hung in the air along with the two horses as they drew
horizontal and level enough for the four passengers to exchange looks
of considerable panic and not a little regret.</P>
<P>And with that, the carousel horses spun heads down to face the
earth.</P>
<P>And they plummeted.</P>
<P>The ground beneath them appeared to be coring itself. Fangles leapt
back and turned the air blue as the earth cracked and twisted itself in
a flurry of deconstruction. </P>
<P>The four airborne adventurers widened their eyes and said their fair
share of extravagant curses as the determined nags shrieked their yells
of approach and met ground level. </P>
<P>When they opened their eyes, presuming that they would be greeted by
magnificent vistas of Elysium and the afterlife, Rapley, Bertha, Heep
and Mr Violet were vaguely disappointed and yet thrillingly relieved to
find themselves in a deep, dark, vertical shaft, the sky a distant
circle far above them. They were falling, or, more accurately, bouncing
from side to side down the narrow fall space, and all scrabbled
successfully for hand and footholds amongst the wooden scaffolding
poles which lined the shaft.</P>
<P>As they steadied themselves, they became aware of the two wooden
horses slowly circling below like sleek painted sharks, their snouts
raised towards them watchfully.</P>
<P>Rapley brushed splinters from his fringe and spoke. &#145;Thank you both, 
a most exhilarating experience. I presume the only
way is down?&#146;</P>
<P>The horses gracefully dipped and raised their handsome heads.
Rapley&#146;s nag, a resplendent beast of paisley dapples and sea green mane
breathed sounds that remained below the reach of most human ears.</P>
<P>Rapley glared back at them, chin set firm and resolute. The others
hung on tight to their respective nooks and crannies and leant forward
to try and catch the enigmatic conversation.</P>
<P>When Rapley spoke, his voice was thick. &#145;But why? Why would he..&#146;</P>
<P>The second circling horse rubbed itself roughly against the side of
the shaft, seeming to exult in the touch of the rough earth. It exhaled
language softly and looked up at him with tired eyes.</P>
<P>Rapley stiffened. &#145;I see.&#146; He said at length, and then turned to his companions. 
&#145;Don&#146;t look. Please. They wish to be remembered as they were.&#146;
He turned his eyes to the wall. </P>
<P>The others hesitantly followed his lead. Bertha yanked down her
hood. Heep lowered a visor over her eyes and averted her gaze. Violet
pushed his pith helmet down over his face like a fencing mask. None of
them quite knew why.</P>
<div class=pullquote>A set of keys upon a brass ring, each one gently
pulsing, squirmed like maggots</div>
<P>The air beneath them buzzed and crackled. A chafing, sawing grind
filled their ears. But it was only when the low moaning began that
Bertha tugged the hood back from over one eye and stared straight
down. The carousel horses were being sanded away in midair. Invisible
implements turning their bodies into frantic showers of woodchip and
dust til all that was left was a horses sea green head grinning with
wide, bulging, crying eyes. Then even that was gone.  Bertha watched 
them disappear with the still, expressionless,
attentive look of a child seeing its first ever act of human
violence.</P>
<P>&#145;Why did he do that?&#146; she breathed, almost without moving her
lips.</P>
<P>&#145;They told me what he was going to do to them, and I asked them that
same question,&#146;, sighed Pasha. &#145;They replied &quot;there&#146;s no whys with
him. It just happens&quot;&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley manoeuvred himself into a sitting position on a jutting rail
of scaffold and sparked a gasper. He looked below and a fiendish grin cut his face.
&#145;Journey to the centre of the Earth, anyone?&#146;</P>
<P>They could hear Fangles mooing and roaring far above them at the lip
of the shaft, but Heep yelled at him to stay where he was, to guard the
entrance and guide them back to the surface when necessary. He wasn&#146;t happy 
about this exclusion but nevertheless accepted that
his bovine lack of physical delicacy would have made his journey down
the narrow hole counterproductive at the very least.</P>
<P>They lit matches and stared into the nooks and shelves formed by the
crisscrossing, roughly hewn scaffold bars, all the while ponderously
clambering further down the dank and musty shaft.</P>
<P>On their descent, they caught sight of a variety of shadowy and
obscene objects.
<UL><LI>A cat&#146;s head in a pickle jar, gazing blankly out at them, reciting
nursery rhymes as they passed. 
<LI>A rank of rusty tin soldiers with their dress trousers around their
ankles enacted a circular chain of buggery with military
synchronisation.
<LI>A map or diagram of a head, the brain inside the skull stretching
inexorably back from the frontal lobe, squashed against the back of the
expanded skull into a coiling, looping tail. The very tip of it poked
through the skin. 
<LI>A set of keys upon a brass ring, each one gently pulsing, squirmed
like maggots.
<LI>An ancient set of tea mugs depicting a royal wedding, filled to the
brim with toenail cuttings and a gentleman&#146;s wristwatch, hands ticking
backwards past all twenty three points of the clock face.
<LI>A wax effigy of a baby with a young girl&#146;s head, fingers melting
towards the surface of the scaffold til they resembled marionette
strings leading nowhere.
<LI>A binoculars-style kaleidoscope which, when held to the eyes,
revealed a prismic view of the many and varied ends of the world, all
shattered into tiny fragmentary scenes. A tiny speaker hissed a
soundtrack of applause and pounded meat.</UL></P>
<P>Something occurred to Rapley and he stopped climbing and cocked his
head to one side. He puffed up his cheeks and his feet performed a tap
dance on a wooden strut. With a chortle he leapt back up the shaft, climbing over Heep and Mr
Violet in his haste. Bertha swung to one side to avoid the whirl of
elbows, knees and manic giggles scampering past her.</P>
<P>Rapley thrust his face into an alcove and came away with the cranial
diagram. &#145;A tube map!&#146; he announced, one eye clamped shut as he concentrated
on the grimy piece of foolscap paper in front of him. &#145;Next floor down,
twenty paces as the stone falls, third beam inwards, chop it three
times with a thin bladed knife and we reveal the legend behind the
facade&#146; </P>
<P>The others eyed him cautiously.</P>
<P>&#145;At least, I think that&#146;s what it says&#146;, he shrugged, &#145;I&#146;m having to
read between the lines somewhat.&#146;</P>
<P>With one hand holding the map close against his nose Rapley dropped
down the shaft. The others scuttled after him like spiders. Twenty paces 
down they dropped one by one onto a jutting beam and
knelt quietly as Rapley pulled a Swiss army knife from the band of Mr
Violet&#146;s pith helmet. The strange, thin man hacked three times at a
wooden bar anchored deep into the dank, mossy wall. As three wood 
shavings sycamored through the air, the beam above the
whittled bar gave an abrupt lurch and creaked up and down like a
chopstick, its twin below joining it in this bizarre pantomime.</P>
<P>The four adventurers held on for dear life as the scaffold bars
jacknifed ferociously, digging a wet and widening hole through the
glistening moss wall.</P>
<P>&#145;Quickly!&#146; Yelled Rapley over the cacophony of clattering timber and
shifting earth, &#145;Through the very eye of the storm!&#146;He dashed through 
the hole, narrowly avoiding the manic swishings of
the scaffold tips. Bertha, Heep and the intrepid Violet followed suit, Violet holding
his helmet over Bertha&#146;s head like an umbrella against an April
shower.</P>
<P>The hollow clashes of heavy wood receded as they tumbled to a stop
on the other side, and when they righted themselves and turned to look,
they found a sealed wall behind them. A hexagonal brass-framed mirror
hung aslant, returning their gaze, it&#146;s surface heavy with dust and
smeared with a pattern of miniscule blood red lipstick kisses.</P>
<P>Heep rattled to her cloven feet and thrust a sharp finger into the
nearest wall. It was sweaty and coloured a thickly opaque white that
crimsoned to the touch like a blush. There was a sense of far off
movement on the other side of the walls, like shadows through a winter
mist or submerged animals rising from the depths of the ocean with a
glacial lack of haste.</P>
<P>Bertha toppled upright onto the soles of her moonboots and cast
glances to and fro. The corridor in which they found themselves stretched in front of
them in a snaking curve, glowing embers in cast iron upturned mouths
dimly lighting the way along the walls.</P>
<P>They became aware of a gnashing of tiny teeth and a rustling rush of
footsteps from around the bend, distorted shadows zoomed towards them
across the corridor floor, rippled and swayed from side to side by the
flickering flames.</P>
<P>Rapley stepped forward and pulled a post-it note from his pocket,
glancing down to decipher Dosun&#146;s wildly looping handwriting. 
&#145;Mr Andrews? We&#146;re from the office. You&#146;ve gone anticlockwise, old
fruit, mind if we lend a hand?&#146;</P>
<P>The chattering and scuffling grew louder and closer. The manic
shadows danced across ceiling, floor and walls. Jagged, poking shadows.
Shadows made by sharp edges. </P>
<P>Behind his back, Mr Violet withdrew his revolver from the bag and
licked the fringe of his moustache. &#145;Just say the word, Mr Rapley.&#146; he muttered,
sotto voce. </P>
<P>And with that, the shadows burst into life. Stubby outstretched arms 
and legs and stunted ovoid bodies coalesced
from the depths, dwarfish creatures grinning with mad intent. They
scuttled and jabbered and whipped across ceiling and floor like a
pestilential swarm of fear.</P>
<P>&#145;They... they all look the same!&#146; Said Violet, and indeed it was true.
 The creatures all resembled each other to a shocking extent: oafish
faces empty of meaning, small features crowded into the middle of
swollen balloon heads, upturned piggy noses and wet, thick dark red
lips like a bicycle inner tube, a crown of ginger hair and shiny
circles of fatigue under the eyes. </P>
<P>The creatures pounced on the four repulsed explorers, swarming over
them in a ravaging mass, scratching and biting and throwing kicks like
tiny hammer blows.</P>
<P>Bertha, nearer to them in size than her companions, slugged it out
with a crowd of them, her deft and accurate uppercuts felling them one
by one.</P>
<P>Violet used his pith helmet as a shield as he despatched blue
bullets into the middles of their expansive foreheads.</P>
<P>Heep took the tops off their heads as if they were boiled eggs.</P>
<P>Rapley gave them a kicking.</P>
<P>&#145;There are too many of these perverted malcontents!&#146; yelled Rapley,
&#145;Run!&#146; He made a dash down the corridor, ploughing a furrow through the
giggling, gnashing dwarves as he went. The others followed suit,
crushing tiny bodies underfoot as they sped after him.</P>
<P>&#145;I have an inkling,&#146;, mused Rapley as he ran, &#145;that our cursed
quarry may be dead ahead of us, lurking in his lair around the bend.
Behold the walls!&#146;</P>
<P>The other three turned their heads as they ran. The walls were
widening as the corridor progressed, and what&#146;s more the colour had
blushed to a sickening crimson. The air throbbed with pressure, a
hollow, bass moan shuddered the ground beneath their feet. Their ears
popped and their jaws began to ache. Rapley slowed to a walk as the corridor opened into a large
room.</P>
<P>A vast animal of a man lay slumped in one corner. The same ginger
crown and miniscule features in an over-inflated head, but this was
flesh on an altogether larger scale than the stunted knee-high freaks
they had previously encountered. His bloated body was clad in an ill-fitting black suit. A white
shirt, black tie and black boots completed the ensemble. His face was
tear-streaked and his mouth convulsed in sobs of pain. He clutched a
framed photo of an unremarkably pretty young woman in a frilled white
shirt, smiling guilelessly at the camera.</P>
<P>Mr Andrews turned his gaze to his guests as he wiped a slick of
tears away with a veritable beef joint of a hand.</P>
<P>Rapley peered at the man with undisguised pity and gave a curt
bow. &#145;Mr Andrews?&#146;</P>
<P>The obese gentleman nodded through his sobs.</P>
<P>&#145;We have been seconded by the company to stitch you back together.
It seems you have become somewhat unravelled.&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Andrews held in front of him the picture of the girl in the white
shirt, he gripped it in two hands like a steering wheel. His voice, when 
it came, was that of a slow and demented child. Like
someone chewing an onion. &#145;She has left the furniture in here. The mugs and carpets, the
fittings remain but don&#146;t work. There is no love.&#146;</P>
<P>As he spoke, he stomped his feet in a tribal drumbeat. He slapped
the side of his head with the steak of his palm. &#145;My heart is gashed. 
And I am split in thousands. I shall damage
some more things now.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;I have bullets left,&#146; hissed Violet out of the corner of his
mouth.</P>
<P>&#145;We can&#146;t shoot him,&#146; cautioned Heep, &#145;Lord knows what&#146;ll happen if
we destroy his mental capacities completely. We may not survive the
seismic shock.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley took a step closer towards the vast lovelorn brute. &#145;Will 
you come quietly?&#146; he enquired.</P>
<P>Mr Andrews roared an almighty roar in reply. The force of it
billowed Rapley&#146;s mackintosh hems into a rippling trail. Bertha was
blown like a tumbleweed against the far wall.</P>
<P>Rapley wiped spit off his face and coughed lightly. &#145;Then it is war, sir.&#146;</P>
<P>There was a crack and a fizz and a blink, and Rapley&#146;s face seemed
to puff up in much the same manner 
as his clothing and then it expanded
to the size of an Easter Island Statue. His mouth flew open and emitted
an elephantine bellow
that sent Andrews spinning.</P>
<P>Then the two men flew against each other, Rapley dancing legs
akimbo, arms whirling every which way, body arcing in physically
impossible ways. Andrews swatted and gnashed at him, growling like a
wounded universe. Electrical sparks buzzed and zapped around them as the others dived
clear. Soon Rapley and Andrews were spinning in a whirl of dust and motion,
blurred features and limbs barely distinguishable through the
vortex.</P>
<P>&#145;Best stay out of this then..?&#146; muttered Bertha.</P>
<P>&#145;On balance, yes,&#146; nodded Violet.</P>
<P>Rapley&#146;s head popped out of the maelstrom as it zipped round at
dangerous speeds.</P>
<P>&#145;Need&#133; Diversion&#133;. Get&#133; Beast..&#146;</P>
<P>Heep ran to the corridor and shouted a single word.</P>
<P>&#145;FAAANNGGLLLLLEES!&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;As far as I can tell,&#146; she explained to Bertha as she ran back into
the room, &#146;this is an entirely psychic battle. It only has the
<i>appearance</i> of a physical ruck.&#146;</P>
<P>The ground shook with the promise of a fresh presence. A mighty
panting issued from far down the corridor. They heard distant sounds of
heavy breakages and of small things squelched underfoot.</P>
<P>&#145;GGGRRRRRRRAAAGGGHHHHHHHH!&#146;</P>
<P>The many-hooved shaggy form of Pompadour Aloysius Fangles III shot
into the room, bristly fur scraping the sides and ceiling of the room
as he leapt through the air, trunk trumpeting the angriest of
introductions.</P>
<P>He disappeared into the spinning blur of bodies, slamming against
the heavier man with a sickening, bone-crunching thud.</P>
<P>They dropped to the floor as one, the air filled with a sonic boom
of immeasurable decibels.</P>
<P>A slow quiet drift of dust and blinking eyes. The ambience breathed
a slow and deep sigh of relief.</P>
<P>Rapley popped his head up from the other side of the two twitching,
inert mammoths. &#145;A most excellent anaesthetic!&#146; he grinned.</P>
<P class=drop>Heep gently led Fangles by his dented trunk as he tottered
in a wide
circle around the walls of the room. A slow revivification of his
senses was taking place and it was unanimously agreed that Heep was the
only person present who could talk him out of one of his violent moods
if his sensory arousal turned sour. He had been known to eat whole
alarm clocks.</P>
<P>The sonorously snoring body of Mr Andrews lay stretched out on a
table. Rapley was knocking on various parts of his anatomy with an HB
pencil and whispering invocations in a mellifluous French tongue. 
&#145;There,&#146; he said, tucking the pencil behind his own ear, &#145;I&#146;ve
locked him up as tight as you like.&#146;</P>
<P>He turned to Bertha and Mr Violet.
&#145;What you witnessed was mere theatre, an externalisation of a rather
absorbing conversation we were having on a more abstracted and rarified
mental plane. Mr Andrews here was good enough to explain to me his
current quandary of the heart. It seems his breakdown came about due to
a soured love affair.&#146; He picked up the photograph of the girl. 
&#145;Andrews was a titanic man, capable of moving the world with a twist
of his thoughts. But he was not, I&#146;m afraid, a strong or emotionally
secure man. One in his position in the Interior must essentially have
no heart or soul to speak of, must indeed be merely a tool or conduit
for his own spectacular abilities, a receptacle with no room left for
the vagaries of human doubt or those true clutches of the emotions that
send all rationality spinning out of control like a sycamore leaf in a
blast furnace. In a sociopathically standard operation such as the
Interior one must have a dead soul. Andrews was not equipped with such,
and, consequently, when love struck, he was euphoric. And when love
died and turned to ashes in the harsh daylight of his own emotional
immaturity, he was not equipped to just shrug it off.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;He went bonkers,&#146; nodded Bertha.</P>
<P>&#145;Quite. The young woman is Hildegard Boone. A woman of great
kindness and tolerance, but not so much that she could continue to cope
with the unfettered, bludgeoning and unrefined declarations of love
proffered by Andrews after her first blush of infatuation with the man
had run its course. When last he heard of her, she had fled to
Hastings with tears shining her cheeks in order to run a boarding
house. I suppose we may be thankful he didn&#146;t pursue her. Lord knows
Hastings is broken-hearted enough without being slathered in the
externalised chaos of Mr Andrews&#146; churning romantic frustrations.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;He seems to have opened up to you considerably,&#146; said Violet
optimistically, &#145;Perhaps reason and sanity are returning and will
prevail.?&#146;</P>
<P> &#145;Ah. No. I gleaned most of the story between his cries, sobs and
repeated attempts to remove the sanity from my person in the manner of
a mental cutpurse. He&#146;s quite mad. We mustn&#146;t let him loose.&#146;</P>
<P>A snuffle from the outskirts of the room, Fangles had awoken and was
engaged in heated conversation with Heep.</P>
<P>&#145;Pasha! Fangles and I have been talking about that.&#146; 
Heep led the stumbling beast to the table.&#145;We have elected to stay inside 
him, at least for the foreseeable
future. We think it would be interesting to take him for a drive.&#146;</P>
<P>Rapley scratched his ears.</P>
<P>&#145;You see, if you can guarantee that whatever locks you&#146;ve installed
on his will won&#146;t break, then we think a change of ownership would be
morally acceptable. And scientifically I must admit that it gives me
the horn to think about testing these broadcast capabilities of
his.&#146;</P>
<P>Fangles sniggered and a string of drool drooped from his jaws. 
&#145;It&#146;ll be Pilsner and mermaids as far as the eye can see.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Well,&#146; said Rapley after a pause, &#145;I suppose you couldn&#146;t bugger
things up any more than <i>he</i> did.&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Violet bade farewell to his old furry friend, letting him lick his
face with his pitted, scouring tongue. Violet jammed the pith helmet on
top of Fangles&#146; vast head as an afterthought. It looked like a thimble
on him.</P>
<P>Heep waved at Bertha, Rapley and Violet absently, already
half-absorbed in the logistics of harnessing the peculiar talents of
the man Andrews.</P>
<P>With Fangles trotting round Heep in a protective circle, the three
weary adventurers walked away into the thinning mists. </P>
<P class=drop>The screen in the Ramp cinema buzzed into a dance of
static, and
they emerged through the deranged light with distortion dripping off
their shoulders like the strands of a bead curtain.</P>
<P>Catherine Paranda threw her magnesium sticks aside and looked behind
them at the screen. &#145;Where are the rest?&#146; she hissed.</P>
<P>&#145;Ah,&#146; lamented Rapley, &#145;Alas, they did not make it. 
They were burnt out, rendered powerless 
by the ferocity of his thoughts.&#146; He looked at the floor with theatrical woe.</P>
<P>Bertha sniffed back non-existent tears. Violet, no good at this sort
of thing, whistled softly and looked at his toes.</P>
<P>Dosun sprang up from his chair with an agility surprising in one so
tubby. &#145;Pah! Details! It cannot be helped. A shame, verily, but the man is
awake! He is restored!&#146; He waddled over to Rapley and shook his hand
vigorously. &#145;Congratulations to you and your associates! A job well done.&#146;</P>
<P>&#145;Yes. All shipshape,&#146; said Rapley circumspectly, &#145;though it's
entirely possible that you may notice one or two slight differences in
Andrews' temperament and aspect.&#146;</P>
<P>Paranda ushered them through to the next room. &#145;Well, of course, he 
may need time to readjust,&#146; she said, &#145;But look -
he is awake!&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Andrews was sitting on the edge of a metal gurney, swinging his
hefty shanks to and fro and muttering unintelligible syllables under
the gusts of his breath. His eyes were clouded and his brow flexed up
and down like a Venetian blind.</P>
<P>&#145;Oh,&#146; said Rapley. &#145;He&#146;s here. What a pleasant surprise.&#146;</P>
<P>Mr Violet winced and backed slowly out of the room, Bertha following
suit.</P>
<P>Rapley whipped around. &#145;Charming exercise, a lovely time was had by all. We simply have to
do it again. But now we really must be going.&#146;</P>
<P>As they sped out of the room with impolite haste, there came a
rumbling from the gurney as the Andrews creature spoke out loud. &#145;I think. 
I think I would like. Like a breath of... fresh air,
please&#146;</P>
<P>Paranda and Dosun rushed to his side wearing expressions of beatific
joy. &#145;Certainly,&#146; said one. &#145;Allow us,&#146; said the other, and they assisted
the giant in whatever small ways they could as he took faltering
gorilla strides towards the front door.</P>
<P>The late afternoon air was clear and crisp, the rainclouds had
drifted on their way to their next appointments. </P>
<P>&#145;Well, cheerio, then,&#146; waved Rapley as he, Mr Violet and Bertha edged
away from the other trio of unusual personages. </P>
<P>&#145;Is it working? Do Heep and Fangles have the reins?&#146; said Violet, out
of the corner of his mouth.</P>
<P>&#145;Difficult to say for sure,&#146; muttered Rapley, &#145;but he hasn&#146;t killed
anyone yet, so the signs are encouraging.&#146;</P>
<P>Paranda and Dosun fawned over the blinking Mr Andrews as, in slow
motion, he lifted one immense paw in front of his face, the fingers
outstretched. A look of intense concentration creased his face.</P>
<P>There was the fleshy pop of a small birthsqueeze and tiny petals
sprang up around each fingertip. Andrews stared in concentration as
these petals grew features, each one a tiny smiling, giggling
replication of Mr Andrews&#146; own face, striped and coloured in vibrant
cockatoo hues of red and green. Paranda and Dosun leapt back in alarm, gasping in shock at such
frivolity.</P>
<P>The laughing petal faces began to chant nursery rhymes and then, one
by one, they popped free of their finger stalks and floated up into
the air like cherry blossom. Each petal was instantly replaced by
another before that, too, popped and separated, filling the air around
them all with a drifting carpet of hundreds of brightly coloured,
laughing facial spores. </P>
<P>Petals began to emerge around Andrews&#146; eyes like a pair of novelty
spectacles, each detaching itself when fully formed to join the
chattering merriment in the sky.</P>
<P>&#145;You don&#146;t see that every day,&#146; observed Rapley as they ran away
from the scene, tiny winking petals blowing them kisses as they whirled
in their wake.</P>
<P>&#145;Can we go home now?&#146; shouted Bertha.</P>
<P>&#145;Certainly. I feel rather jaded from all this activity. The
excitement has begun to wear off and once again I can feel the cape of
boredom draping itself over my slender shoulders. A cup of tea and a
Garibaldi sounds ideal.&#146;</P>
<P>A flock of pigeons swooped through the giggling, multi-coloured
cloud of leaves in the sky, emerging wearing headdresses of shining red
and green petals. They looked at each other in confusion, like petulant
sultans.</P>
<P>The moon had begun to show itself through the rich, dark blueness.
</P>
