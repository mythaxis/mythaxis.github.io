<div><i>"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human
stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
<b>Albert Einstein</b></i>
<p class=drop>I had been without a cat long enough for
both armchairs to be free from residual fur, and we sank back
comfortably into relaxed positions, sipping at our iced fruit-juices.
"So, Hollis.  It must be what, five, six years?  Quite a coincidence
bumping into each other like that!" <P><div class=pullquote>Play a bit of tennis, eat a lot of
cheese.</div>Hollis smiled wryly.  "It's good to	see you, Alex."
Hollis told me he
was here for a few days, visiting Meredith, his married sister, and his
two young nephews before flying back home to Geneva. <P>"I must say you&#146;re looking well."  Privately, I wondered whether he'd
been on a diet.  He looked fitter than when I had last seen him, his
eyes almost unnaturally bright. <P>"I try to keep in good shape," he said. "Play a bit of tennis, eat a lot
of cheese."	I raised an eyebrow.  "For the tryptophan," he explained
seriously. <P>"Ah."  I nodded, not wanting to appear uninformed on
the subject.  "And are you still colliding those large hadrons?" I
enquired, trying to add a touch of levity to his gravity.   <P>He granted me another brief smile.  "Actually, no.  I left several years
ago to pursue some independent research which doesn't need all that
expensive equipment.  It's ... unorthodox, you might say, but, well,
fundamental." <P>I was intrigued.  I was under the impression that modern physicists were
practically inseparable from their cutting-edge technology.  "Care to
tell me about it?  If it's not confidential, that is." <P>"Hardly confidential," said Hollis. "Let's see, you would need to
understand something of quantum uncertainty, wave/particle duality, the
Feynman sum over histories, chromodynamics, supersymmetry - and of
course some of the implications of M-theory, but I suppose it would be
an interesting challenge to explain it to, to a..." <P>"An old friend?  An ignorant architect? A <I>layman</I>?" I supplied. <P>Hollis grinned.  "Precisely, Alex." <P>It was a bright, cloudless Thursday afternoon in July.  Beyond the
French windows the sun continued to shine, as the good Sam Beckett
reminded us, on the nothing new, but within the next few days whatever
grip I thought I had on reality was due to slip from my grasp like a
particularly well-buttered eel. <P>Hollis launched into an enthralling account of what the best scientific
minds believe to be the nature of the universe.  I realised he was
simplifying it for me, skirting those elegant equations relished by true
initiates, but nonetheless my brain was soon buzzing with fascinating
bits of information.  Variously &#145;flavoured&#146; quarks: three to a proton,
three to a neutron; unseeable, yet bound as if by elastic.  Leptons and
bosons.  Model-dependence.  Einstein&#146;s abandoned cosmological constant
reinstated to explain the accelerating expansion discovered by Hubble.
The astonishing double-slit experiment: the behaviour of single photons,
interference patterns, particles that take simultaneous paths, quantum
probabilities.  How mapping the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic
microwave background radiation confirmed the age of the universe and
showed the distribution of seedling galaxies.  What unexpected things
occur at the event horizon of a black hole.  Eleven dimensions, some
very small and curly.  The no-boundary condition and the multiverse.
The holographic principle, recursive layers.  Infinite possibilities,
ultimate interconnectivity.  Information.  &quot;Matter and energy are
incidental.  Information is the key,&quot; said Hollis.</P> <P>We paused for a round of sandwiches.  I had run out of cheese, so we
opted for smoked salmon and sticks of celery with a cr&ecirc;me
fra&icirc;che and paprika dip, washed down with a complementary Muscadet
&#150; a fortuitous gift from one of my clients.  Later, as Hollis was
enthusiastically propounding how holography could also be applied to the
structure of neurons, and thence to memory-storage and consciousness
itself, I noticed that it was now almost dark outside.  We were both
reluctant to interrupt this flow of information; Hollis had clearly
warmed to his task. He used my &#145;phone to let his sister know where he
was, and agreed to stay for supper. <P><div class=pullquote>If you&#146;re agreeable, I&#146;ll come round again and give
you a small demonstration.</div>One of the advantages of a slow cooker
is the number of servings that it
can hold in reserve, and fortunately there was a good supply of the
experimental Stroganoff which I was glad to be able to share.  Once
fortified, we began round three.  <P>&quot;Where was I?&quot; asked Hollis.  &quot;Oh yes, levels of
consciousness, individual perception, and so on...&quot;  Soon we were
encroaching on what had once been the exclusive province of philosophy,
then psychology and latterly neuroscience.  Reverting to the holographic
principle, Hollis told how this neatly accounts for synchronicity and
similar subjectively experienced phenomena which defy causal
explanation.   &quot;All those anecdotal instances of telepathy and
clairvoyance, the psychic research, the dodgy ESP experiments with their
statistical anomalies and not-quite repeatable results; most of the
experimenters were well-meaning, but pretty much groping in the
dark.&quot; <P>&quot;What about science-fiction writers?&quot; I ventured.  &quot;Don&#146;t
some of their speculations come close to what you&#146;re describing?&quot; <P>&quot;I can think of a few interesting attempts,&quot; said Hollis.
&quot;Pohl, Sturgeon, Simak, Brunner, Herbert &#150; some of the classics.
It&#146;s a question of having sufficient background knowledge coupled with a
really good imagination.&quot;  He stretched.  &quot;Anyway, for a
<I>layman</I>, I must say you&#146;ve been quite attentive, and even
convinced me you&#146;re genuinely interested, so, before I fly back next
Tuesday &#150; if you&#146;re agreeable, I&#146;ll come round again and give you a
small demonstration.&quot; <P>I tried to draw him out on this, but Hollis declined to say any more,
other than to thank me for my hospitality, and to arrange for a visit
mid-afternoon on Sunday. For the next couple of days I was restless and
impatient.  I kept reviewing what Hollis had said about the relationship
between the microcosm and the macrocosm, the dizzying idea that <I>all
possible</I> events in our space-time continuum occur in a simultaneous
Now, and are somehow superimposed, and therefore theoretically
accessible at <I>every possible</I> point. Or that alternative
histories, each a fractional departure from any specified event, are
continuously being generated.  The plan on my drawing-board for the
ecologically optimal refurbishment of a country hotel went untouched.
What kind of demonstration did Hollis have in mind? <P><p class=drop>Sunday morning.  I hadn&#146;t slept well.  I had a complicated
dream which involved trying to retrieve a damaged kite, except that it
was not a kite, but a scroll on which a short poem had been written.  I
reached up into the sky and caught it.  It felt like fine silk.  I knew
it needed to be repaired, and headed for the building where such repairs
were carried out, but as I approached a low cloud touched the roof with
a molten glow, and it was too dangerous to move any closer.  I awoke
with my mind racing, trying to clear the disturbing images from my
thoughts.  After breakfast I decided to &#145;phone Hollis, to confirm our
arrangement.  Luckily, I remembered that his sister&#146;s number would still
be on my &#145;phone, and I hoped he wouldn&#146;t mind the early call. <P>After a while a boy&#146;s voice answered.  &quot;Hello,&quot; I said.
&quot;This is Alex, a friend of your uncle Hollis.  Could I speak to
him, or to your mummy, please?&quot;   <P>There was a silence.  I heard breathing, then the &#145;phone being put down,
followed by a yell: &quot;Mum.  It&#146;s a man.&quot;    <P>Moments later a woman&#146;s voice, a little distracted:  &quot;Not on the
carpet, Robbie, and give Gareth back his&#133; Sorry, can I help you?&quot; <P>&quot;Hello&#133; Meredith?&quot; <P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;Who&#146;s that?    <P>I explained who I was, and wondered whether I could have a word with
Hollis about this afternoon.   <P>&quot;Hollis?,&quot; she repeated, uncertainly.   <P>&quot;Yes, I&#146;m sorry to bother you, but he&#146;s due to come and see me a
bit later today, and I simply wanted to make sure&#133;&quot;     <P>She interrupted. &quot;I&#146;m afraid I haven&#146;t a clue what you&#146;re talking
about.  Hollis who?&quot;  I stared at the &#145;phone, perplexed.   <P>&quot;Hollis.  Your brother.&quot;   <P>&quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; she said.
&quot;My brother is in New Zealand, and his name is not Hollis.  How did
you know <I>my</I> name?&quot;   <P>I started to explain, and suddenly realised it would make no sense.  I
broke the connection.  What was going on?  It had to be the right
number; she said she was Meredith, and there were definitely two boys in
the house.  Was it a practical joke? Had Hollis told her to pretend he
didn&#146;t exist?  What would be the point?   I took a deep breath, and
tried re-dialling.  Nothing happened. Somehow, I had managed to wipe the
number, and I couldn&#146;t remember it. Not only that, but I didn&#146;t know her
married surname, or her address. All I could do was wait and see whether
Hollis would turn up, and if he did, what devious explanation he might
have. <P>It was another warm, clear day.  I went for a forty minute walk to clear
my head.  I had concluded that either it had been a good hoax, or they&#146;d
had a sibling row, and she had chosen not to acknowledge Hollis or his
friends.  I spent a few minutes at the drawing board, made myself some
coffee, tried to read, caught up with the news, listened to Lucia Popp
singing Strauss&#146;s &#145;Im Abendrot&#146;, had a light lunch of boiled egg and
salad, strolled round the garden, and finally sat down to wait.
Mid-afternoon came and went.  I must have dozed off, because the next
time I looked at my watch it was five o&#146;clock.  I felt really
disappointed.  Hollis had been so stimulating, so full of
thought-provoking ideas, and now he had failed to turn up with his
promised demonstration, whatever it may have been.  Glumly I walked to
the front door and opened it.  The street was deserted. I bent down to
remove the flimsy piece of cloth that had blown onto the outside mat.
It was a length of very fine torn silk on which some faded lines of
verse had been written or printed.  Even though they were frustratingly
illegible, there was something worryingly familiar about them. <P><p>
