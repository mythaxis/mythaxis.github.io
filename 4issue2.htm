<div align=center><img src="oasis.jpg"><BR><h2>The American Book of the Dead</h2><BR><h3>Chris&nbsp;Lites</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>This piece is very much a homage to William Gibson, but
it is an experience all of its own. Rich brown writing, this.</i>
<p class=drop>The sign pointing off the interstate
once read OASIS. Its steel bolts are scoured chrome by the sand, and 
the truck stop hasn't been, not really, not
for a very long time, an oasis.  <P>Now, Rand sits in the last hours of sun under the
chemical hemorrhage of sky, watching the truck stop logo play itself out
in an epileptic loop of hologram butterflies. Polychrome glint reflected
in the angle of a fading wing. An old gas station logo from childhood that he
remembers. The butterflies sputter over the concrete, and
the sand that has come in to 
reclaim the blacktop, winking in and out of
existence, oil-on-water wings, but the hydrogen pumps they advertise have long since ceased to
function. He watches from the motel across the street, here where
travelers would once have stayed, when these thick lanes saw traffic.
Sitting in the old deck chair out on concrete where the silt shifts
under the wind at the bottom of the pool, a gecko nearly the same blue
as the pool's faded paint regarding him with its limbic eyes. <P><i>Rand's
fingers trace over the peeling laminate of the old photo album, cheap
even in its heyday, its cover a bubble-gum pink smudged now with age.
Inside, the happy family he has constructed awaits.
Someone else has
assembled the pictures, the post-cards, the fragments of self, 
none of
them really being related except by proximity of date, but Rand has made
them into a family. On the cover, where the label card used to be,
someone has written in old marker, 
in thick block capitals: THE AMERICAN
BOOK OF THE DEAD.</i> <P>Rand gathers his pack from his car, shifting the vehicle on its
carbon frame, thin and light as insect legs, just a husk now,
desiccated, powered out, useless, left here under the sun. He'll need
further transportation if he's going to continue to follow her, pursue
the steady distal pulse of her GPS across the desert. He pops open the
second to last of a self-cooling bottle of real Alaskan spring water and
thinks of his days on Farm 14, cool Pacific days along the coast so far
from the tip of Florida where he grew up. Far from the chaotic
changes of the lower forty-eight where things were going south rapidly.
He saw it firsthand, with his real family, before he became a
privatized orphan. <P>The sky has bled itself out and his gel-contacts
squirm in a way he has never gotten used to, adjusting to low light. He
forces a door to one of the motel rooms, allowing the stale air to
puff out toward him. 
He has stirred dust and particles of sand in the
old room. Nothing more than a bed, a vanity, a bathroom and moth-eaten
curtains shifting in the wind. Old style TV, one of those big types from
last century, the cathode ray tube long gone, he learned about those at
Farm 14, a piece of early technology. The gutted TV is now
some half-assed shrine left by passing migrants. Candles burnt down to
lozenges, a sun-bleached animal skull and what he takes to be an ill
conceived haiku, a sad offering to whatever animism the nomads have
taken to following these days. Never really having recovered from the
depression, they just broke off and franchised into a whole floating
sub-culture out here in the new dust bowl. Still, a place to bed down
for the night, find transport in the morning. He amps up his gels, the
unsettling squirm of proto-amphibian, bioengineered life. He opens his
photo album, so long now a prosthesis for absent things. <P><i>He has no idea, nor does he want to imagine, who so carefully
assembled the pictures. They
are, he has come to realize, from a period of not more than two decades
of the great American century. And while the people in the album are not
strictly a family, he likes to imagine them as such. There is Father,
Mother, Son and Daughter, their faces, body types and clothing shifting;
they spend their days among the same summers, along the same roads
of an American world rich in Googie architecture, cantilevered coffee
shops, curvilinear UFO-inspired drive-in's, huge Lumber men, tiki gods
lording over shark finned future cars streamlined to roll their
occupants directly into the world of tomorrow. They are culled from the
unconscious of the "space-age". A time that maybe never really was, Rand
has come to realize, but one with which he has become so intimately familiar and
entranced, that, in the evening, before he beds down, he may be found
taking in a few of the white cardstock pages, the collected photos
secured with NuAge corner bonds, Kodak film almost exclusively -
pictures of happy people, people with bright futures limned in
possibility, rocket trajectories, beeping satellites, Fuller-domed moon
bases...</i> <P><p class=drop>Hotter this morning, contacts giving him a HUD for temperature, wind
speed, his basic vitals, the present statistics of his world and being.
He takes his MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> out of his pack and unrolls it on the
scratched
table of the motel room. It adheres with a hiss, sealing
temporarily over a history of dust and grime. Rand wipes through the
muddle of tickers, broadcasts, news feeds and banner ads and directly to
his bookmarked tracking of her GPS. Making a steady beat for the Pacific
coast to find transport back to Brazil, to Rio, home. Always the
memories of the wet warrens and flooded barrios of that city inside her.
He remembers watching her when
she would come, looking at him, but truly
far away, staring at him from beneath layers of aquatic sunlight, all
the stunted promises of drowned kingdoms reflected in her eyes. <P>She is at least a day and a half ahead of him now, perhaps more if he
doesn't find transportation. But if he follows her too closely, she
may shut down the GPS altogether, may zone out, drop off the radar
and disappear back into the jungle. It is a game of sorts, their game,
or anyway he tells himself that this morning as he does from time to
time. Or, if he is going to be honest with himself, which he isn't, not
today, too hot for that - rivulets of sweat finding their way down his
buttocks, down the backs of his knees - it's really just classical
conditioning. Projecting onto the women in his life what he wants to be
there, that's what he does, that's what he learned... back then, in
Gainesville, with his sister. <P><p class=drop>His sister was born with a brain that the doctors could just
never fully
correct. There were therapies employed, long string names that he had
forgotten and been too young to understand anyway. What it amounted to
was that, while she was present, most of her would always be locked
away. So, who she was became more a reflection of who you wanted her
to be and, though he would like to remember that, he tried to allow her
to be whatever it was that was inside herself, but he knew that was not
the case. His sister, the archetype, the blank slate, the art project,
more often a case to be managed, a situation to be solved, a story
problem. Keeping her occupied was the thing to do. He remembered her OCD
impulse for tying things around her fingers, anything that would bend,
anything you would give her - straw wrappers, thread, filament, fishing
line, errant hairs (hers-black) - starting with the index, then down to
the pinkie, left, then right, like scales. When you could get her doing
that, it was a kind of security. She wasn't lost, off exploring the
perimeter wire, the rusting razor falling into the rising surf, where
she would mark the progress of the escalating tide with colored ribbons,
more knotting, her own chart of the global upheaval. She wasn't at a pier
trying to catch a glimpse of refugees being broken upon the naval cordon
as they tried to get into the country, keeping her own inscrutable
mental tables of their arrival and failure. She wasn't running off
amidst a riot that broke out during a particularly militant protest of
an Amnesty International splinter group. She sat there as police moved
in with their bulky, comically sci-fi riot gear, mother and father
desperately searching for her. She appeared on no less than three news
feeds, the calm center of the local fraction of global chaos, mother and
father looking on, stunned. Within two weeks, all three of them were dead. <P><p class=drop>Rand examines the back of the walk-in refrigerator, long
since out of power; the insulated walls are warm to the
touch. He finds a spring catch for a manual release which opens an
antiquated physical mechanism, a door to an emergency shelter. <P>Narrow concrete steps leading down to what is little more than a cramped
basement, canned supplies including vast quantities of spam - the
allegedly edible variety and bottled water - but not self-cooling,
All of it older than he is, this panic hoarding having been popular with
a certain strain of
eco-survivalist who thought the climate shifts were going to do them in
before the economics or the human reactions did. <P>Under an olive drab tarp, an early solar-powered electric car, probably
not particularly fast, but
still in working order. It will have to do. He hikes up another set of
stairs and releases the catch on
a latch in a trapdoor that leads outside the diner. He rolls the
Multi-Film<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> into binoculars, dials up the magnification and scans.
Razor-edged horizon slipped between desert and the wheeling shoals of
clouds tacked to a block of blue sky. <P><i>The family was always on vacation. People never took pictures of just
being, not back then. Or, if they did, they didn't put them in albums.
Pictures were special then. It wasn't recording everything as it
happened, it was recording what you wanted to remember. He hasn't ever
given them names; they are simply placeholders in the atomic age
nuclear family, their faces and hair colors shifting while the
essence of their meaning remains the same. Father under sun-bleached
white of desert sky, Cabazon, big dinosaurs.
Mother holds Daughter who is young and making a face at the camera, Son
holds plastic miniature versions of the two behemoths in the background,
one T-Rex and one Brontosaurus. Though the Brontosaurus was a mistake,
wrong head on the wrong body, he looked it up, in the Farm, on what
they called microfiche.</i> <P>The skin of the vehicle whorls with mad-trip colors, absorbing the sun,
the outside has become a Panorama blue screen projection, panels of
motion somehow much removed from the interior and not a part of Rand's
immediate present. He is the lone car on the interstate, traveling
through the dust bowl, along this road that once might have
carried his picture book family. 
<i>Oldsmobile
Futurematic. Futurematic combines beauty with utility... styling with a
purpose. Hydromatic drive! The smart way. The Futurematic way. The
Oldsmobile way. Futurematic is a brand new word, created to describe this brand new,
post-war, General Motors' car. </i>
Now he drives past the
sagging lines that once were necessary to carry communication, their
shadows forming a lattice between the dry tufts of yellow grass that
shoot up through the old road. <P>This sun-powered car he drives now has no new words to describe it,
affords
no psychic real estate that he knows of. It is too old to have its own
HUD so, he has stuck the MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> to the
windshield. Her GPS
still
radiating on the screen, but fainter now as she reaches for the coast...
He remembers reading about white line fever and prays that it might
visit him now as the endless klicks unfurl in monotony around him. <P><p class=drop>She was one week out of Rio when he found her, wet and
feral and
smelling of the septic, flooded barrios of that old and tangled city.
Her name a passion, a curse, a guttural expulsion. Why she had come
here, she wouldn't say. Weeks spent trying to adjust twin pairs of Sony
ear-bead translators to the twists of her patois. But nights, their
sweat drenched skin clung together; he imagined he could smell the
orange and fish scent of the markets on her, mystery of jungles in her
own dark, pubic curls. Lying there, under the ceiling fan of a
broke-down hotel, she would unfold childhoods both confusing and utterly
fascinating, all the dark mystery of a stratified society of commerce
and savagery down there in the heart of Brazil. She described a place
that had gone back to more primal ways long before the rest of the
world. He could imagine her sometimes looking out to the slips of beach,
eyes finding the coastline, the suggestion of the sea and all that might
lie beyond. <P>He'd heard rumors of cults and human sacrifice, of street gangs mad with
cheap meth roaming the canals, river rat gangs on Jet Ski's tearing
through the heart of overindulged myth, Aztec fantasies and paranoid
memes. Rio had been virtually cut off from the mediated world for years
now, and nobody much cared to investigate. So suspicions went there to
dream and ferment, and one of them, he suspected, had become her. Grown
in the dark curls of hair, twisting strands of genetic code had rooted
and grown, producing this girl, with her coppery skin, her aquatic eyes,
her mind subject to its own, ever shifting, unstable mental winds. <P>He might imagine them, from time to time, these two women in his life,
like the fall of a camera's shutter, dividing then from now, before from
after. His sister and this strange woman from a stranger land. The one
before, the one after, and the bridge of self he had formed in between
seemed so inadequate and ad-hoc now. A person more likely imagined by
the aggregate imagination of the two of them, clinging as he did to the
pursuit of the one that was still alive and the memories of the one who
wasn't. A dream of a thing called Rand, flipping through the sun faded
days of a century long gone, through smiles, years dead, tints in
flushed cheeks stripped by decades' faded hue. A world comprised of
promising thrusts of architecture, of Muffler men thirty feet high, of
all night Bowling alleys described in neon, of Tomorrowland at
Disneyland, of Eames furniture played out as the space age equivalent of
Lucite kitsch. There, Father, red haired this time, Mother pregnant, the
children merely possibilities now, standing in front of the Big Boy, his
perm-a-grin suggesting some compulsory happiness, some fascist
cheerfulness in the aggressive upsweep of his Brylcreemed coif, hefting
his burger above as some capitalist trophy. Or, the whole family
standing in front of a Sputnik parodied satellite atop a road sign,
spikes every-which way, the dream folded and folded upon itself again,
kaleidoscope origami. <P>She would catch him sometimes, when he would sit in the bay window of
the house abandoned near the sea line, the sound of the surf, paging
through the days of the family. And she would laugh and make fun of him
in Portuguese and English, laugh at him for the fondness he had for that
dead century and its people. Laughing, Rand took it, at his need for his
surrogate pantheon in these faded pages in their kitschy binder, for his
inability to form a Rand divorced from the sad tomorrow land their
futures had become. While she, with her lean muscles and erratic
behavior, stalked the atavistic Serengeti's of her mind, finding older
cores to build upon. So fucking lonely, so fucking American she would
say, as if the word had meaning anymore. <P>Out here, amongst the scrub and hollowed towns, they collected
e-waste, once, a futile attempt at early recovery. Mounds of obsolete
computers, PDA's, televisions and other electronics harvested for the
copper and any other reuseable parts had accumulated, an economy of
subsistence. Started by eco-hippies as first, the e-waste had once gone
to third world countries where villages would burn the refuse to get at
the valuable scrap, inhaling PVC's, cadmium, lead. But soon it became a
domestic franchise, the re-farming of machine dreams, IT engineers,
programmers, high priests of tech who had to give up their white collars
to be drawn out, backs to the sun, working under masks, columns of smoke
rising into the sky, eking out some semblance of an existence, trying to
resurrect lives.
He had seen that sort of desperation, back in Florida, before the storms
hit. The town already collapsing under the weight of economic failure.
Empty storefronts becoming ersatz shrines for those who were taken in by
the sudden urge to find God, the big fix paradigm. One crazy sect he had
seen projected their crucified holo-Jesus over neo-flagellants, slung
over the street as some disturbing, displaced Macy's float like Rand had
seen on television.Faint ripples of maxized bandwidth creeping over the
Jesus's wet, slick
flesh, hinting at organs seeking to push through the wound of the unseen
Roman spear. Men were stripped to their waists, flailing themselves in
front of their pitiable Lord hung from his neon cross. There, the Jesus
lolled its head as if in some opiate slumber of pain and religious
ecstasy, his final moment of apotheosis come, in this, his last
submission to the physical form. Rand winced as the ball bearings tore
into the men's flesh, his father pulling him further down the street
away from the display. The Lord sputtered in and out, and became
intangible above him. He had asked his father why they did this, and his
Father said because the men were in futures, and the market was bad for
futures now. Rand figured any fool could see that. His father had
laughed and said that wasn't what he meant. The next day, the Jesus and
the men were gone. <P>Her trail continues along through the transparency of the screen. He is,
he thinks, perhaps gaining too close a proximity to her. Best for her to
know that he follows, but not so close as for her to panic. He wonders
if those eyes stare from beneath their marine depths to watch him
watching her on some MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> of her own.
Observe this game that he imagines she too still plays, remembering the
times he has tracked her down before. She had always let him catch up
before. <P>She never settled into his life. He'd wake nights; watch her through
the floor-to-ceiling window as the tide came in, brown ankles in the
surf, huddled in a frayed duvet washed too many times, and invariably
she was looking south. <P>He could see her tension, at the parties, forming at the corners of her
mouth, conversation tinkling around the backyard of a fashionable house
in a gated suburb. People talking recovery and opportunity and hopeful
buzz words like nanotech, bio-growth, market-states, but never any of
it coming to anything more then drunken speculation. He'd watch her
across the concrete patio, the light refracted from the blue plane of
water played over her. Mentally she was already gone. His friends had
never really been hers, or really his he supposes, just people
collected through work, which was itself an abstraction. The next
night, when he woke, she wasn't on the beach and her bag was gone. In
the morning, he left in pursuit. <P>
A skirmish line of broken hotels along a beach. The property, once so
prized, now chipped at, worn down by accumulated tides, left to ruin. A
few feral dogs pick through the old structures, some nothing but
foundation, others holding the reinforced concrete shells of multiple
stories, scrubbed paint, empty windows. Old anodized chain-link fence
pokes out of the tide line, tsunami ideograms warn of catastrophes that
might have come a few years back. Rand removes his shoes, which squelch
and morph to a more relaxed size as he does, the sand wet under his
feet, padding his way down the shore. <P>Further on he can see a man, brown from the sun. Rand has crested a hill
and watches him below. He wears tattered cargo pants cut at the ankles
and carries a sturdily made wooden rake. He has fashioned the beach into
the precisely combed concentric waves of a Zen garden. Beach rocks
serving as the locus of their radiation outward, he has fashioned his
own movement so that his footprints do not disturb the whirling patterns
he has traced. He is almost done. The tide creeping ever closer, his
ephemera creation soon to be carried away in much the slow, deliberate
process as it was made. <P>Perhaps twenty meters away from him, atop the same rise, the man climbs
and watches as the waves lap and blur the lines in the sand, the garden,
until only the rocks remain. He then lights a fire he has prepared and
walks to Rand, offering a cigarette. Rand accepts, and by the fire, they
smoke. The man covered in sand, clinging to the wet of his body, a red
bandana gone black above his brow. Up close Rand can see that he is
perhaps Polynesian. In any case, he doesn't seem to speak English, and
so they sit in silence. They finish their cigarettes, and Rand shows the
man his map. On it, the trail of her signal has led here, paused, and
then gone south. There was a port here, according to the map, but no
structures Rand has seen suggest so. Much of the current topographical
data can be unreliable these days. He pulls up a picture of her and
shows it to the gardener who nods, points south, and takes the map from
Rand. The man's fingers work over the worn film, his nails surprisingly
well-manicured, and he returns it to Rand, a new map keyed in one corner
window to another port, or perhaps the right one all along. Ten miles
south, her GPS pulses once more and then cools, fading over the Pacific.
She has, he realizes, finally turned it off. They sleep by the fire, and
the sand makes Rand dream of the scratchy surplus blankets huddled under
at the Farm. Communal barracks, morning shower, cafeteria meals,
everything regulated but not uncomfortably so. <P>He trades the old solar powered car for passage on a Tasmanian freighter
headed south. He maneuvers onto the gangway through the brine scent of
ocean air and the press of travelers, merchant marines and freight
haulers. Shipping has become suddenly vogue given the cost of most air
freight these days, the west coast not yet having been hit by that wave
of prosperous recovery the news feeds claimed was rolling over from the
east. Rand unrolls his MultiFilm&#153; one more time, but she hasn't turned
her signal back on. She won't, she has dug herself out from the membrane
of connectivity now, slipped south now and quite probably gone. <P><i>His hands run over the rusted hull as the ship sets to port,
reassured
by its solidity. He imagines that perhaps the Son might be there, on a
single frame of old Kodak, right next to him, bleached color of that
era's film stock, his olive drab uniform that much more so. The next
picture reveals the family gathered along the dock. Today their hair is
predominantly blond, the Mother and Father just that bit older as Son is
seen off to a strange tropical land they've never heard of, but always,
they can believe, for the best of causes. Rocket trajectories,
satellites, smooth, flowing, Futurmatic lines&#133; And here in these two
frames, at the end of the book, the nuclear family fissions and begins
to part. They become the fast-motion images of desert test sites and
mocked up homes blown to atomic winds. Coca-cola signs gone to tinny
rust, Googie coffee shops plowed under yellow Tonka monsters, tiki gods
desiccated from lack of worshippers, Apollo capsules burnt to dust on
re-entry. It begins with a son, putting to port for a faraway land,
coastline of home receding behind him.</i> <P><small>&copy; Chris Lites 2007 All Rights Reserved </small>
