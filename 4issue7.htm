<div><i>If this is insanity, it's insanity gone mad!</i>
<p class=drop>The black maze walls gleam, shine, she should be able to see her
reflection in their surface, she thinks. But there is something wrong
about the whole material, something particularly unnatural. Hate
thinks of black holes and the way that they absorb light, the way they
suck in everything that gets close. She takes another step forward.
The walls tower overhead. As far as she can see - black, overwhelming
walls. She traces a hand along the glassine surface, a habit she can't
help, that need to touch things, even if for a moment. Now, she
hesitates. It is hard, with no sense of give. More than any other
surface she has touched in her time in the city, the endless surfaces
she has caressed in attempts to verify her continued existence, she
has the least doubt that this surface is real. She pulls her hand
away, losing heat to that evil wall, losing a little skin as well, she
suspects, her fingers stinging a little where they touched the
surface. Or is that her imagination? <P><div class=pullquote>If you squinted
you could almost imagine that those three triangles lined up in a row
might represent something like a crown, as depicted by a child
perhaps.</div>Hate had been adopted as a baby, had known no other life, and her
parents had not been forthcoming with any information that gave her a
clue as to where she had come from. As far as she knew it was her
parents that had picked the name Hatred, though she had never been
able to fathom why they had picked that name of all names. It was
certainly a name that had haunted her, who would let their children
play with a girl called Hate? Other children had been cruel to her,
her response being twofold - to withdraw and have as little 
as possible to do with
anyone else and to get angry and lash out at anyone who pushed
forcibly against the walls that she built around her. Her parents
hadn't helped, had given her little support, and she was often left
wondering why they had adopted a child at all. In her teens she
retreated further, into books, into fiction, into fantasy novels, she
devoured them by the dozen - borrowed them from the local
library, or bought them second-hand with the little money she could scrape
together here or there. <P>Logically there were two generic explanations - she was a screaming
lunatic in a mental hospital somewhere back home or she had somehow
found one of those famous, fictional gateways between one dimension
and another. With the first being the more plausible explanation she
had spent every day here waiting for the reveal, the lucid moment in a
hospital, where it all made an appalling sense. But here she was,
years gone by, surrounded by animal spirits and demons, monsters in
the night, and a world which otherwise seemed not that much different
from her own - people had jobs, read books, listened to music, caught
the bus as it went round the city and all sorts of other nice normal,
sane activities. She didn't feel mad, she didn't feel crazed, in fact,
and she was loath to 
admit this to herself at any point, if anything
she actually felt as though she had finally come home. Things had been
great, life had been interesting, for all the peculiarities of this
place, until a few nights ago. <P>When she turned 21 she had had enough, she was leaving it all behind,
she was disappearing from life as part of family Philips. She planned,
had built up a reserve of cash, from Saturday jobs and paper rounds
over the years, before she had gotten on that bus to leave Glasgow
behind. She had planned to go to London. She had told no one of her
intentions, after all, who was there to tell; so she had no real sense
of making a cut when she got on that bus and left it all behind. She
was disappointed by that sense of a lack of closure, that failure to
have a tangible sense of having given someone the finger. She presumed
that someone would notice she was gone, sooner or later; perhaps even
make some token attempt to find out that she had taken a bus to
London, though she couldn't be sure anyone would make any effort at
all. Regardless of whether anyone ever did work out that she had
intended to go to London, tracked that ticket she bought, she had
fallen asleep on the bus, and instead of London she had arrived in
this strange other city, a sprawling place which was reputed to go on
forever, the city of Ascension. The creation myths she had picked up
along the way suggested that the city was everything; that outside the
city there was nothing; further, that no one had actually ever reached
the end of the city. Which would seem, of course, to contradict the
stories of the sea that she also heard. <P><p class=drop>Returning to her front door with a foxy girl she'd picked up on a
night out, she had discovered a sword, leaning innocently on the doorpost, for
no reason that she could determine. She had been out
clubbing, trying to distract herself from the more complex aspects of
her life, when she'd run into a group of pack girls, she had picked up
this one, and brought her home for the night, not expecting to find
this plain-looking thing in a battered sheath here waiting for her. It
was almost more of a machete than a sophisticated weapon like she
thought a sword should be, plain as plain could be, save for the three
triangles on the hilt which matched those which had been carved into
the surface of her door, presumably by whoever had left the weapon,
and in a manner that was no doubt intended to be deeply significant,
if only she had the slightest idea what it might mean. If you squinted
you could almost imagine that those three triangles lined up in a row
might represent something like a crown, as depicted by a child
perhaps. She had brought the weapon into her flat, thrown it into one
of the armchairs and gone back to the business of taking the giggling
young stray to her bed.  <P>Woken in the night by the sound, chilled by
the sick red light of that hideous moon, Hate had pushed the armchair
against the front door, the sword still sitting there. Then the pair
of them had clung together in bed, terrified, while they heard the
screams and hideous sounds of death come shuffling. Everyone else in
the building had been slaughtered. In the morning, the two of them
were the only survivors. <P>All signs that she could find suggested that whatever had happened,
the persons responsible for Salsa's disappearance were the same as
those responsible for the darkening of certain areas of the city.
Rumour being that someone lived in the heart of corruption, that there
was a castle grown from the ground, in which evil had taken residence. <P>So here she is, following the trail of Salsa's disappearance into the
darkening streets of the city, into the heart of whatever evil had
come to power here; this creeping expansion that seems to consume
another street each day. She clutches the handle of that sword, the
sheath strapped to her belt the sense of those three triangles against
the flesh of her hand somehow reassuring. <P>There had been no apparent explanation as to why they hadn't been
devoured like everyone else. The police who found them there the next
morning were amazed, having waded through so many floors of carnage.
Pushing each door open carefully with their spears to reveal the
horror within. Surprised to find resistance here, to find a
traumatised Hate easing the door open in response to their calls. Hate
had looked at those triangles again, the one on the right traced out
in red, blood having run down the grain from that contact - they had
come that far and paused- why? Was it something to do with those
triangles, while everyone else counted her blessings, she wondered
what other forces were at work. Particularly when it was around the
same time that Salsa had gone missing, her best friend, the true
object, the unobtainable object, of her affections - the one she would
much rather have taken to her bed than some club girl strayed from her
pack. Gone. <P><p class=drop>She takes another step forward. Round a corner she comes to a square.
It would probably have been quite a nice place at some time in the
past. Blackened cafes, blackened chairs, blackened fountain and
blackened statues. The statues are of great lions, their aspect is
fearsome, and Hate would almost swear that their attention is focused
entirely upon her and her progress. She takes another step forward.
The lions, to her relief, show no reaction. Though there is a sound
behind her somewhere, something is back there, or a number of things,
moving fast, and making a lot of noise about it. Something that seems
to be headed in her direction. Hate can only be certain that this is
bad news. She starts to run, a careful trot, consciously pacing her
energy as she crosses the square, leaving it behind as she enters
another black corridor, leading round black corners, to more black
corridors - buildings that were once houses and businesses absorbed
into the monolith. She would like to feel as though she was heading
somewhere, as though she wasn't about to turn a corner and find a
fatal dead end, but she has no such assurance and can only conclude
that by keeping in motion she keeps the possibilities open. <P>The sounds behind her keep getting closer and she fights against the
spike in her pulse, the natural sense of fear which threatens to
overwhelm her. She can hear scraping, and dragging sounds. The first
thing that comes to mind is that she is being pursued by zombies,
those monstrosities responsible for the attack on her building, the
undead creatures who formed nests in the city's abandoned buildings.
At this point she is probably the only thing resembling fresh meat for
some distance, most people having the sense to avoid the expanding
dark zones. If they catch her they will certainly tear her apart. She
draws her sword and starts to run faster, hoping that running and
carrying swords are compatible activities. Adrenalin starts to churn,
Hate actually smiles, the rush, the energy - she runs every day,
pounding the streets, exploring the world, ensuring that it remains a
constant, getting miles in before the start of her shift at the record
shop, but that is not like this. The street she is in splits, a wide
dead end in one direction, a narrowing alley that looks as if it might
go further. <P>She makes a choice, and she crouches in the narrow corridor. Gripping
her sword. Telling herself she is ready for first contact. Though,
given that until she found this weapon she had never actually even
held a sword, she can't help but feel a little absurd. A figure
staggers into sight. A second and third are just visible behind. The
first figure stops. As Hate presumed, they are zombies. Not too
bright. It takes them a moment to work out where she has gone.
Sniffing her brains, fragments of nostrils held up, inhaling noisily.
The pus-filled orbs that take the place of eyes attempt to focus in
her direction. Once this figure was a man, a big one, now he is a
broken thing. He would still tear her head open, rip her brains out
and slap them around his face as though they were some fine delicacy.
Of course, Hate has no intention of letting that outcome arise. More
zombies come behind the first three, a couple shoving at each other
pointlessly as they try and get further ahead, one crawling, legless
thing snakes its way past the log jam the other two create. Arms
outstretched, in a manner that Hate thinks is distinctly clich&#233;d, the
lead zombie lumbers towards her. He groans, rank breath carrying
fragments of what might once have been words in Hate's direction. She
holds her crouch steady. The blade in her hand feels right. The burn
of adrenalin is still buzzing through her. The zombie swings an arm at
her. She stands, stepping forward, driving the blade straight through
his chest in an upward sweep, slicing up and out through his neck.
Sludge spurts and falters. The zombie keeps moving, delayed reactions
and momentum know no mercy. But another couple of slashes and the
bastard goes down, though as he does the crawling zombie, grinning
obscenely through a lipless mouth, climbs up the tumbling carcass. Its
blackened nails claw at the body to gain purchase. Coiling, the thing
prepares to leap at her like some ghastly frog. One slash and the head
goes flying, the thing unbalancing in the process. The stream of the
dead keeps on coming. Hate's sword seems to pulse with an energy as
she swings recklessly, hacking body parts left and right. <P><p class=drop>"Blood and souls! Blood and souls for Arioch," Hate suddenly shouts,
the phrase from one of Moorcock's novels popping into her head,
grinning like a psychotic. While her weapon might not be leaching
energy from her enemies, the way that Elric's evil weapon Stormbringer
did in those novels, it does make hacking up zombie bits seem easy.
She can't help but feel she has become like a character in one of
those books that she read when she was a teenager, of how she finds
herself living in one of those books now, how she is the heroine in an
impossible situation. Hatred Philips, twenty-three years old, and
fighting for her life. At least until enough carcasses have mounted up
in that alley that it has become difficult for the zombies to get any
nearer, which she takes as her cue, to turn, and to run. Salsa is in
here somewhere, what kind of hero would she be if she fell at the
hands of the zombie horde and failed to save the woman she loves? <P><P><small>Copyright &copy; Peter Morrison 2010
