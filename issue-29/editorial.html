            <p>Smile, reader! I stand on the threshold of a little anniversary! But first, <em>a downer</em>.</p>
<p>When I first published an issue of <strong>Mythaxis</strong>, some parts of the world were already tightly locked down against the spread of Covid-19, while others were still reluctantly shaking off months of complacency and thinking about doing the same. I personally had been isolating for several weeks, fortunate to be able to work from home, far from family but somewhere I was not completely alone. For me, that situation remains much the same. I&rsquo;ve only shared space with my day-job colleagues on a handful of occasions since then, and a social life conducted more via screens than in person has become second nature.</p>
<p>In the slow-time existence that has ruled since all this began, it seems like the world is punctuated mostly by negatives: the escalating spread of the virus; political strife of one flavour or another; vaccine inequality, made all the more unacceptable given the rise in vaccine <em>denial</em> wherever over-abundance is the norm. And now, of course, an unjust war to add to all the others, given special treatment this time for being on the doorstep of The West.</p>
<p>Fair to say, <em>it&rsquo;s not been a great few years</em>.</p>
<p>But, for me, it&rsquo;s not been all bad.</p>
<p>Today, almost exactly two years after my first issue as editor, I deliver my eighth. Collectively, they represent sixty-seven pieces of writing (and two cartoons!) by almost as many different creators, not to mention cover images by six human artists and one artificial intelligence, and invaluable behind-the-scenes help from collaborators both past and present. The vast majority of these people-and-or-proto-sentient-beings I&rsquo;d never have encountered if it were not for this magazine, and my experiences with them all have been very rewarding—to say nothing of how much I enjoy my own creative activities in support of their work.</p>
<p>The title of this issue&rsquo;s cover art is <strong>Music is His Oxygen</strong>. I chose this piece because <em>making beautiful things</em> doesn&rsquo;t just help make life generally worthwhile, it can be what keeps us alive through the difficult times, creators and audiences alike. So, I hope that <strong>Mythaxis</strong> and the stories we&rsquo;ve been fortunate to include bring you pleasure, and they help to keep us all going until times take a turn for the better again.</p>

			    	<em><strong>Andrew</strong> is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing</em> Mythaxis <em>he has been published in a small handful of quality zines, and co-authored a serialised alternate history adventure novel. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesn’t update <a href="https://andrewleonhudson.wordpress.com/">his website</a> or use <a href="https://twitter.com/AndLeoHud">twitter</a> often enough to count.</em></p>
			    <p></p>
			    <p><strong>ISSUE 29</strong> - <em><strong>Thanks and Salutations!</strong></em>
Thanks once again to cover artist Bobby Cooper, whose open invitation to use his work made <em>Music is His Oxygen</em> a tempting choice! Bobby works with colored pencil on black paper, with strange and beautiful results — you can check them out on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bcooperart/">Instagram</a>, and he has <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/bcooperart/shop">an online shop</a> with myriad cool options too.</p>
