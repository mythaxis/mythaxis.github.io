ver roughly the last twelve months, the <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> team has been conducting a generally light-hearted experiment in applying AI technology to short fiction publishing. We&rsquo;ve been using the cutting edge tools of the day to create an artificial intelligence so familiar with the tastes of the editor that we can task it with judging all story submissions on his (that is, <em>my</em>) behalf. One day, when it&rsquo;s proved itself to our satisfaction, we fully intend to hand over the reins of <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> to the &ldquo;Slushbot&rdquo; entirely.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve framed it.</p>
<p>We talk about our experiment as if one day it&rsquo;s going to wake up like the AI-Pinocchio of online magazine publishing. But that&rsquo;s never going to happen. We&rsquo;re not training an artificial intelligence at all. An <em>artificial</em>-artificial intelligence is closer to the truth. In fact, what we&rsquo;ve been doing is considerably more mundane, though no less interesting from our perspective.</p>
<p>So, while you can also read the glamorised version of the story in our recent editorials (see Issues <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-31/editorial.html">31</a>, <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html">32</a>, and <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html">33</a>), I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to discuss more seriously what we have, and have not, been doing behind the scenes during the last year.</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><glyph >I</glyph>

&rsquo;ll start with a negative. The world has become both enraptured and/or outraged by the arrival of Large Language Model (LLM) &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; text generators – <em>ChatGPT</em> being the most famous – and the visually stunning output of &ldquo;generative&rdquo; image systems, such as <em>Midjourney</em>.</p>
<p>These are not the tools that we are using, and for several good reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, at the current point in the development of such systems there are <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-invisible-workers-of-the-ai-era-c83735481ba">ethical question</a> marks hanging over which we find concerning. Generative systems need to be trained on vast quantities of material (millions or billions of images; <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaqz/ai-isnt-artificial-or-intelligent">countless lines of text</a>), and there is at least the possibility that some of that material has been used without permission. The implications of this are far-reaching, not least the question of who can legally be considered the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of a work that is created by a so-called AI. <a href="https://programmedinequality.com/">Is it the software developers who coded the tool?</a> Is it, even, the tool itself? Or <em>is</em> it the person who entered a prompt and received what they asked for? Regardless, we should also ask what rights and credit are owed to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxn3kw/openai-used-kenyan-workers-making-dollar2-an-hour-to-filter-traumatic-content-from-chatgpt">those whose work the tools</a> were trained upon, with or without their permission.</p>
<p>Until satisfactory answers can be provided, these tools are problematic. Therefore, though we have experimented with image-generating AI tools in our less well informed past, we shall not do so again in future. For similar reasons, we don&rsquo;t invite submissions of AI-generated stories for publication, because it is far from clear who the true author of any such text would be.</p>
<p>The second reason we don&rsquo;t use generative tools is much simpler: our objective isn&rsquo;t to <em>create</em> anything, at least not in the sense of <em>writing a story</em> or <em>painting a digital picture</em>. We want to make a tool, not a product, and it&rsquo;s a tool with only one application: <em>predicting what kind of stories the editor of <strong>Mythaxis</strong> likes to publish</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><glyph >F</glyph>

undamentally, what we are doing is the rollercoaster thrill-ride called <em>data analytics</em>. We&rsquo;re dipping into the toolkit of academics working in fields such as &ldquo;digital humanities&rdquo;, &ldquo;distant reading&rdquo;, &ldquo;data science&rdquo;, and (a label now maybe more familiar to the general reader thanks to events of the last few years) &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So far, I have published exactly 99 stories as editor of Mythaxis. I have rejected approximately 20 times more than that in total. This represents the body of data we want to know more about. To do so, the stories are anonymised, analysed individually, and the resulting data is aggregated. And then we analyse <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>We aggregate data into three categories of story:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acceptances (the stories we decided to publish)</li>
<li>Rejections (the stories we did not)</li>
<li>Better-rejections (ones which made our shortlist)</li>
</ol>
<p>What we call &ldquo;the Slushbot&rdquo; is really just the statistical output of a number of software tools which look at all that data and try to identify patterns. We&rsquo;ve been doing this for a year, and so far the results are not good. Even a couple of thousand stories is not a big data set. Worse, the texts in that data set vary in incredibly diverse ways: they range in length from 1,000 to over 7,000 words; they use different regional styles and spellings of English; and they represent wildly different subgenres under the general umbrella of &ldquo;speculative fiction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that even remotely coherent patterns are so far not forthcoming.</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><glyph >W</glyph>

e&rsquo;ve used a number of different software tools so far. Our original attempt used <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/setfit">SetFit</a>, a machine learning classifier, then we turned to <a href="https://sbert.net/">SBERT</a> to explore &ldquo;embeddings&rdquo;: a mathematical representation of data, in our case linguistic data, such that each word, sentence, or paragraph can be compared against others to determine a degree of similarity or association. It is these associations that (we hoped, in vain) would allow distinctions to be identified between the categories we have chosen.</p>
<p>We have also used <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/">Orange Data Mining</a> and the research methodology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading">distant reading</a> (see also <a href="https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000317/000317.html">here</a>) to explore and visualise a variety of linguistic patterns in the data. In all cases, we&rsquo;re careful to work with these tools locally, never sharing our data with organisations that could put it to uses outside of our control.</p>
<p>Arguably our most encouraging find has been <a href="https://www.liwc.app/">LIWC-22</a>, linguistic analysis software used to help identify which narrative qualities <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> &ldquo;looks for&rdquo; when accepting or rejecting a story submission. This involves focusing down on how different parts of language and language use (verbs, pronouns, punctuation, speech acts, narrative tone, cognitive tension, story tropes, categories and topics, etc) feature in a text.</p>
<p>One thing which many of these tools have in common is, at least to my unskilled eye, <em>incomprehensibility</em>. The following image gives you a very general sense of what working with them looks like, and I&rsquo;m glad that side of things is safely in the hands of my collaborator, Marty Steer:</p>
<p><img src="images/analysis-collage.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Fortunately for me, LIWC stands out for the relative accessibility of its information output, being able to produce simple graphs suitable for an <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-33/editorial.html">editor-level degree of interpretation</a>:</p>
<p><img src="images/Accepted-vs-rejected.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Whether my interpretation is actually correct or not is another matter entirely!</p>
<p>We have plans to test other tools of this sort, some of which offer more dynamic visualisations of the underlying information. Currently we&rsquo;re not yet past that number crunching phase, and perhaps we never will be, but the following is an idealised workflow for our future submissions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever the window opens and new stories arrive, our tool would analyse each one, compare its statistical data with the patterns that it has learned represent <em>acceptances</em> and <em>rejections</em>, and make a prediction about which category each story falls into. At the end of the window, we compare all its choices with mine and categorise the stories according to whether they were in fact accepted or rejected, increasing the body of data against which its future predictions will be made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there yet, but in the event that the tool&rsquo;s predictions come to reflect my actual decisions, it could be a very valuable resource. We&rsquo;re a small operation and I always read all submissions, but the number of subs keeps increasing, so this takes a lot of time and effort. A trustworthy tool could be designed to order the slush pile according to predicted acceptance rating, or simply highlight what it considers strong candidates for immediate attention.</p>
<p>Either of these approaches could make a significant difference in what sometimes seems a very daunting task.</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><glyph >W</glyph>

ith all that said, we still have at least the shadow of an elephant in the room, I think.</p>
<p>There is an admitted similarity between how LLMs are trained and the way we study the story submissions we receive, and authors submitting their work to us for consideration might worry about that fact. This is understandable, so I again want to reassure them on this point. Yes, true, in both cases texts undergo statistical analyses: the tools examine their sources of &ldquo;data&rdquo; in detail, looking for patterns upon which to perform their functions. The critical difference lies in what the ultimate objectives of those functions are.</p>
<p>LLMs and other generative tools use the statistical data they amass to generate outputs of a similar kind. If you train them on works of fiction, they become <em>fiction simulators</em>: machines that make texts with similar characteristics to &ldquo;a story&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I choose my words carefully here: not to get into the semantics of it, but unless a human agent is directing them very closely, I don&rsquo;t think LLMs make actual <em>stories</em> at all – just something very story-<em>like</em> (and even given a human agent in that directing role, as we&rsquo;ve said, the question of whether that person really is &ldquo;the author of the text&rdquo; is debatable at best).</p>
<p>By contrast, the tools we work with only output statistics. If you feed them stories, they don&rsquo;t become capable of making story-like texts. They just give us a new way to look at what is actually there. And, as an editor, what I always want to know is whether <em>what is there</em> is a story I will like, or a story I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably never succeed in making a tool that can tell me that with any accuracy. But we think it would be very, very cool if we did.</p>
