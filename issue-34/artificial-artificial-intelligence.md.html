ver roughly the last twelve months, the <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> team has been conducting a generally light-hearted experiment in applying AI technology to short fiction publishing. We&rsquo;ve been using the cutting edge tools of the day to create an artificial intelligence so familiar with the tastes of the editor that we can task it with reading story submissions on his (that is, <em>my</em>) behalf. One day, when it&rsquo;s proved itself to our satisfaction, we fully intend to hand over the reins to the &ldquo;Slushbot&rdquo; entirely (though probably just the once) and let it choose the stories that go into an issue of <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Or at least, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve framed it.</p>
<p>In fact, what we&rsquo;ve been doing is somewhat more mundane, though no less interesting from our perspective. So, while you can also read the glamorised version of the story in our recent editorials (issues <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-31/editorial.html">31</a>, <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html">32</a>, and <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html">33</a>), I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to discuss exactly what we have, and have not, been doing over the last year.</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a negative. The world has become both enraptured and outraged by the arrival of Large Language Model (LLM) &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; text generators – <em>ChatGPT</em> being the most famous – and the visually stunning output of &ldquo;generative&rdquo; image systems, such as <em>Midjourney</em>.</p>
<p>These are not the tools that we are using, and for several good reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, at the current point in the development of such systems there are ethical question marks hanging over them which we find concerning. Generative systems need to be trained on vast quantities of material (millions or billions of images; countless lines of text), and there is at least the possibility that some of that material has been used without permission. The implications of this are far-reaching, not least the question of who can legally be considered the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of a work that is created by a so-called AI. Is it the software developers who coded the tool? Is it, even, the tool itself? Or <em>is</em> it the person who entered a prompt and received what they asked for? Regardless of any of those questions, we should also ask what rights are owed to those whose work the tools were trained upon, with or without their permission.</p>
<p>Until satisfactory answers can be given, these tools are problematic. Therefore, though we have experimented with image-generating AI tools in the past, we shall not do so again in future. And for similar reasons, we don&rsquo;t invite submissions of AI-generated stories for publication, because it is far from clear who the true author of any such text would be.</p>
<p>The second reason we don&rsquo;t use generative tools is much simpler: our objective isn&rsquo;t to <em>create</em> anything, at least not in the sense of <em>writing a story</em> or <em>painting a digital picture</em>.</p>
<p>We want to make a tool, not a product, and it&rsquo;s a tool with only one application: <em>predicting what kind of stories the editor of <strong>Mythaxis</strong> likes to publish</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how we&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
