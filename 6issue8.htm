<div><i>In a war zone, every bit of kindness makes a difference.</i>
<h3>13th January 2031<h3>  <P><p class=drop>There is a certain weary comfort to a Monday morning here;
despite the horrors in the prefabs and the faintly gamma-positive sleet
pocking the poly roof of my office, I take some solace from the generic,
familiar schlep of the starting week.  <P>I have been up for three hours already, a nagging occipitalis ache
dragging me neck first from an uneasy sleep on my surplus noncom cot. In
contrast to my usual fractious, broken dreams, my office looks the same
as always - a small pokey appendix epoxied to the back of the main ward.
One small desk, one half-destroyed chair - the seat as hard as
permafrost, one semi-opaque sheet of plastic masquerading as a window,
one extremely modern laptop - my sole luxury - is probably the single
most expensive item in a hundred kilometre radius. There are over a
thousand carbon and partially silicon based entities within effective
sniper fire range that would cheerfully kill me for it, but so far I
think I've kept it a secret. A beautiful distillation of thirty years of
west coast technofetishism, the computer fortunately doesn't look
anything like a computer does here in the technological doldrums of the
Middle East - they still coo over a Macbook in these parts.  <P><div class=lpullquote>stories of whitewashed caves, dentist chairs,
chugging Honda generators</div><P>
I have no fixed schedule here, but many
demands on my time. My charges
have the sweet plaintive demands of the truly helpless, raggedy stick
and bone shapes only faintly tenting the rough blankets that are the
only bedclothes available in the chilly main ward of the hospital. As
usual I make a morning tour of the ward, a depressing euphemism for a
shuffling survey of the two small bays that are the full extent of the
hospital. Zalmai is awake - I've never seem him asleep - his sightless
head tracking every small sound I make as I negotiate the defunct
medical clutter he insists on heaping on and around his bed, a pitiful
hedge against further pain.  We found Zalmai about a month ago; he had
crawled over twenty kilometres from the Maheepar Pass to the suburbs of
Jalalabad. I was led to where he lay by one of the filthy
interchangeable urchins who hang around the compound and who know we
will pay a few afgani for information on the latest unfortunates to
stagger out of the western mountains. Zalmai had heard me coming, the
chill winter morning air telegraphed my approach clearly to his
undamaged ears. Mewling pathetically, he had scrabbled backwards,
bloodied palm prints darkening the cracked, dried mud of the grubby no
man's land of the road verge. He looked up at me - his excised,
bloodless, empty sockets somehow a much worse horror than the terrible
battle gore I had seen and treated - they had taken his eyes.  <P>The Pardis Hospice is a mean, swingeing,
annex shoehorned into the small space that used to optimistically be
called the Jalalabad Hospital main car park. Now a gomied dumping ground
for shrapnel-ruined medical equipment and discarded prosthetics striking
improbable vogues, the park is also home to our three ex-NATO inflatable
medical tents. Transitory structures long past their half-life, the
prefabs are home to that most contemporary of war victim - the organ
thieved.  <P>We've been here for a little over three months and I've already seen,
treated, consoled, and sometimes watched die, over seventy victims of
the mountain gangs. It's a hard road from Kabul, and all are fair game;
scooter punks who think they know it all, <i>M&eacute;dicins sans
Fronti&egrave;res</i> newbies, economigrants nomading their way to the
Pakistan border and back in tattered annual caravans of privation. The
gangs seem to prize Christian aid workers most of all. Last week, a
shattered Isuzu pickup dumped the legless, not yet lifeless, torso of a
Jesuit priest right at the entrance to the main prefab; he was also
missing his eyes, and as we found out later, both his kidneys and liver.
He died with his eyelids pinned back, never saying a word, his fists
hiding a crushed rosary. The ones that live are harder to bear, so many
stories of whitewashed caves, dentist chairs, chugging Honda generators,
blank, black eyes - and so much pain. Oddly, these surgeons are
curiously attentive to the aseptic technique, only a handful of our
patients ever seem to develop opportunistic post-operative infections,
and, judging purely on surgical finesse, these butchers seem to wield
their antique scalpels with aplomb.  <P>The ward stirs as more breakfast grumblings join Zalmai's quiet demands
for flatbread and black tea. Several dislodged dressings add to the
night fart miasma with the high sweet smell of putrefaction, and the
splosh-clatter of a bed pan hitting the floor adds to the fun. I
dispense some gloves, filter up and get to work. <P><p class=drop>Air quality permitting, I try and hold the group sessions
outside. When the particulate meter settles into a quasi-quiescent
tick-tock metronome, we bundle up the patients into hand-me-down NBC
suits and stretcher/carry/cajole our charges into the ambulance (an
ungainly USMC anti-mine deuce and a half) and head south east to the
poppy fields near the Khyber Pass. Since the mujahideen went synthetic
savvy and the UNODC quashed production with the simple expediency of
tactical nukes, the endless opium plantations have been abandoned and
gone to seed. The orbital feeds now show a more colourful Afghanistan,
like an ironic mockery of old empire cartography the landscape is a
startling seasonal scarlet against the otherwise unrelenting high
altitude view of the endless browns and greys of the Middle Eastern
prairie.  <P><div class=lpullquote>Zalmai wheels, turns, pitches and yaws across the
poppy field</div><P>The poppies hide the other prefab I maintain, a
quiet
place that is
tolerably well preserved by fading UN logos and still functioning outer
skin chameleon polymers. Ignored also, because of its notional salvage
value, the prefab offers us a valuable hiatus space, only occasionally
spoiled by a few empty beer bottles and rank hobo piss. Appearances
aside, I still feel that there is useful work to be done here. We
(mostly me) are one small part of what in quainter (more na&iuml;ve)
times
might have been called a guilty conscience. But it's pointless trying to
anthropomorphise a corporation; the lesson I've learned from fourteen
months in field is that WorkSpace is nothing but deliberate.
Unencumbered by the human flotsam of pity, or empathy, or consideration,
the WorkSpace behemoth moves deliberately and with perfect self-focus. <P>The Combat Revenue model is a well-worn, well-practiced algorithm that
allows for the faintest expressions of largesse at carefully determined
intervals. The CR tacticians noticed early on in shock and awe
profiteering that they had to allow for a degree of mercy, an
amelioration of <i>take</i>, to maximise their returns. It seems that
even the best-insulated corporate psyche quails eventually in the
one-way bazaar of war. <P>This is where I  come in -
one small articulation (a feeble prosthetic nod to decency) of the
post-war official WorkSpace Health and Reconciliation programme. Like a
shot in the arm of battlefield stimulant, we had an amazing first year
in Jalalabad - epic funding, baksheesh up the wazoo, access all areas -
even for a Guardian-reading tosser like myself, it was hard to resist
local government-sanctioned largesse... This year's been rather
different. We are no longer the flavour <i>du jour</i>; by October,
WorkSpace PR had already moved onto a free HIV-immunisation programme
for the Cape Town townships, and the scooped torsos and cleanly
delineated stumps of the organ thieved were old news. Funding dropped to
less than ten percent of year one, we lost most of the international
team, the patient suicide rate soared, we moved to the prefabs in the
car park and I lost the one decent camp bed left in southern
Afghanistan.  <P>We still have the poppy prefab though, and on a spring day with the
early red petals tinting the view, we make some useful progress with our
crippled coterie. Zalmai, in particular, loves the plantation; he knows
that there is nothing to run into, the worst he can expect is a turned
ankle in a rabbit hole. It's become a tradition, as soon as the
ambulance hits the bumpier surface of the gravel road leading to the
prefab, Zalmai grabs my sleeve and turns his eyeless face to mine (a
mute plea I can never resist) and points to the ambo door. I slow the
truck and punch the door release.  <P>Zalmai hoots and leaps, rolling easily
on his left shoulder, the poppy buds leaving sticky resin on his crappy
jacket and brown dust and early sun forming a glowing corona around his
thrashing form. Then he's up, running, arms outstretched, a child's
aeroplane freedom - a thing of beauty compared to the adult fetishism of
war hardware that Zalmai unconsciously mimics. <P>The Afgani children that I have met all seem to share an uncanny ability
to imitate the clanks/drones/rumbles/snicks/clicks of the American
armour they have grown up with all their lives. Zalmai wheels, turns,
pitches and yaws across the poppy field filling the air with a pitch
perfect echo of an A12 tankbuster on afterburner, punctuated
occasionally with the bumblebee gargle of the chin chain gun.  <P><p class=drop>The activated charcoal in the aircon has long since been
inactive and the prefab   smells like camping trips and the drying
wetsuit tang of childhood seaside visits. I peg back the membrane door
as far as it   can go and we all  shuffle in, Zalmai bringing up the
rear, taxiing reluctantly into the musty space.  <P>Currently our complement is only seven. A recent <i>c. difficile</i>
outbreak, a spectacular gastrointestinal revolt that left the whole ward
retching and grieving in equal measure, resulted in two deaths. There
was only one surprise, a goat farmer who had wandered into the hospital
compound, unaided, only missing a lung and his left hand. He died four
days later, after the <i>difficile</i> infection swept through the
wards. <P>Also present are some other stubborn remnants of this year's intake:
Max, a shaggy, denimed member of the ubiquitous tribe of nomadic
westerners that form a grubby, globally-spanning gulf stream of
trust-fund disillusionment and disestablishmentarianism. Six months ago
Max found himself muling out of Kabul with an amphetamine-packed colon
and a nearly valueless solid roll of hyper-inflated Afgani currency. The
Rough Guide is woefully short on hitching advice for the Kabul-Jalalabad
road and Max's abortive attempt to flag down an ancient Peugeot estate
resulted in a third-hand colostomy bag and a free ride to our hospital
car park. Ashur the Syrian, my star pupil, a dead man walking. Ashur was
a DOA at Jalalabad Central hospital, a bloody bundle of rags that had
been cursorily admitted by an exhausted night staff and then rolled on a
broken trolley into an unused corridor in the ER. Doubling as a trauma
surgeon during the first few weeks of my secondment I found this gory
heap as I took five and sucked down my millionth smoke of the night.
Ashur  is what we call a full donor - multiple organ theft and over
fifty percent of limb reduction. Incredibly he was conscious when I
found him, his one remaining hand pawing blindly at the fetid hot air of
the ER. I was new in-country back then and I was gear-rich and drug-fat
from my new WorkSpace coffers. The hospital wing they had assigned me
for the organ theft project was full of box fresh, state-of-the-art kit
designed exactly for the life extension of this type of victim. Ashur
was at the thin end of a survival spectrum probability but back then I
was full of enthusiasm, energy and na&iuml;ve hope. <P>He made it through the night; his cored torso emptied of offal and
filled with a million euros worth of modular life support. That long
night was a vague memory of grey market Marlboro consumption, the
blinking LEDs of the medical gear and the gurgle/rattle of a jury-rigged
trachea/air filtration unit connection. Ashur is a continuing miracle,
wholly dependent on ageing med gear, scrounged feedstock and smuggled
hormone replacement analogues; yet he has an easy, beatific smile and
always some time for Zalmai. Ashur reminds me of a turn of the century
cyborg wet dream gone wrong. Like a crippled borg lacking the
transcendent scope of Stelarc's vacuum-bound nude explorers, Ashur is
his own street, making his own uses of the tech we can scrape together
for him.  <P>Gula always brings up the rear, she invariably insists on carrying the
Job from the ambulance to the prefab, an essential piece of kit for the
group sessions. Nearly two metres tall, Gula's single huge right arm
easily flips the modular Job pod off the roof rack and onto its
undercarriage of sprung wheels. Gula has not spoken since she came to
live with us in the prefabs, she has no overt medical needs and I can
only assume she was also a victim of the mountain gangs, the clean stump
of her left humerus betrays the trauma of involuntary surgery, not the
impartial mangled legacy of a farm accident. Gula's huge beautiful green
eyes miss nothing and she acts as our minder during the vulnerable hours
we spend in Job immersion during the counselling sessions.  <P><p class=drop>Even with the pharmacological mitigation and enclosure
comfort provided by the Job, therapy with my patients rarely shares the
structured, ethereal
angst of a first world counselling session. Dealing not with the maybe,
the bogeymen of possibility, the faint spectre of disaster - all distant
cousins to true pain; these fragmented souls have already seen and felt
far too much real trauma to compare even fleetingly with my pampered
Albionside client base. After a year of patching up tattered psyches,
gibbering will-o-the-wisp surgery survivors, I have developed an
involuntary rage response when I think back to the work I did at my
Acton practise. When I remember the plaintive middle England whining of
mortgage rate hikes, second job exhaustion, the draconianisms of my own
erstwhile employer, and the dull throb of thwarted careers, the gorge
rises and I frantically pat my pockets for the Marlboros.  <P><div class=lpullquote>the rest of the group forms a circle around Zalmai
and me as we interface</div><P>Here in Afghanistan, in this millennial
crucible of conflict, pain is
<i>real</i> and my patients have experienced the full gamut. Not for the
first time I am struck by the depressingly familiar irony of the urgent
consumer strivings of my own cosseted countrymen for
tastes/flavours/newness - bring me a new shirt, a new tie, a... new
thing... anything. Daily I am reminded of the timeless Couplandism -
"purchased experiences don't count"; here, instead, in-country, almost
everyone is looking for a refund of their own bitter, involuntary
transactions. It's a hard lesson too, after a whole life of
absent-minded gratitude for an accident of birth - a genetic dice roll -
it only took a year in Afghanistan to realise that my former life was a
hollow and valueless as a scooped thorax of one of my pillaged charges. <P>I have a full quiver of therapeutics, though, and fading WorkSpace
funding notwithstanding, I've got good gear. During the prefab sessions,
when we're making a semblance of progress and the tears flow usefully
and cathartically, I feel like I did when I de-planed in Baghdad - a
clean arrow of determination fletched with the belief that I can make a
difference - salve the terrible open wounds of conflict damage.
Technology helps, the long chain polymer perfume of new tech, the
replete power packs, the semi-autonomous repair packs, the vacuum sealed
MREs - though I have painfully and incrementally discovered that all
these hedges against chaos and disorder are merely a delay, a brief
hiatus of intervention that lasts only as long as the new car smell.
After a year of petty theft, pilfering, abrasive desert winds, and the
inevitable over-usage entropy, out of all my original kit only the Job
is running at anywhere near full capacity.  <P>The Job is a two person therapy model, with empathy bias. Designed in
2030 by a Dutch-Italian WorkSpace subsidiary, therapy Jobs were built
around a central core concept: <i>To feel is to understand</i>. The one
hundred and fifty years of the psychotherapy industry had always been
hobbled by one glaring central limitation - to know someone is not to
know their pain - and without that knowledge there can never been true
understanding, and in turn, succour. The therapy Jobs make the tenuous,
febrile moments of therapeutic insight a concrete reliability. Using the
manipulation of mirror neurone activity - the observationally triggered
physiological process that occurs when conspecific animals (humans
included) witness each other's pain - the Jobs use pharmacological and
electroneurological interventions to augment and enhance the biological
empathy response. This includes the primary nociceptors - the
propagators of noxious stimuli. This means that in Job-facilitated
session the therapist feels the patient's pain. Considered somewhat of a
Wild West field by the old school of non-interventionists counsellors
and therapists, Job therapy is not for the faint-hearted. The pain, both
phantom and real, of (for example) missing limbs, despite being buffered
and baffled by a series of filters controlled by both the therapist and
the patient, could be extreme. Still fringe, and therefore deemed
"deployment-acceptable" in non-first world contexts, the empathy school
was taking some of the first painful steps towards true understanding
and healing.  <P>Today it's Zalmai's first session, somewhat of a rite of passage in
these de-traditioned times. I ping the Job a wake-up sequence from my
smartphone and it uncurls from its wheeled repose. Carapaced like an
over-plated armadillo, the Job snicks-snucks-clicks into the standard
new patient configuration. Designed to minimise further unnecessary
distress, these Job models lack the sanitary/elimination hook-ups of the
standard corporate Job models, and they also have a much more friendly
on-board AI avatar - gender-variable dependent on the client. Forming
the now standardised defensive outward looking perimeter (a welcome
evolution of session security initiated by Gula), the rest of the group
forms a circle around Zalmai and me as we interface. I lead Zalmai to
the patient saddle, the Job flaring open in a welcoming proboscis
embrace. Seating Zalmai and hooking up the pharma-feed and the skullNet
takes a few minutes, a pause capitalized as usual by at least four of
the group lighting up, I don't really mind - H&S is a distant concept
these days. The Job chirps an environmental particulate/carcinogen alarm
but I squash it immediately - first world puritanism can go fuck itself. <P>Having made Zalmai comfortable and giving him a few minutes to acquaint
himself with the Job, I then hook myself up in the therapy seat.
Accessing the public landing space I  prep a stylised simulacrum of the
poppy fields outside. In the therapySpace the neurointerface provided by
the Job means that during the sessions Zalmai will see again (a direct
optical nerve hack that anywhere else in the West would be available as
an outpatient procedure), and I want him to have a nice view. The quiet,
small voice of the Job whispers - go - in my ear and the session begins. <P><p class=drop>At nearly thirty-seven thousand kilometres above southern
Afghanistan, the geo-stationary WorkSpace relay milsat is a barely
detectable stellar mote in the clear, frigid, night sky. Suspended in a
cylindrical vat of liquid helium, and protected with a ring of bulky
tanks of propellant, the mind of the satellite pulses gently with a
superconductive glow. It doesn't really think; WorkSpace tends to impose
a max AI capacity on geosynchronous weapons platforms with kinetic
missile capability. Nonetheless, the dim, dog-like musings of the sat
envelop its operational output like a primary colour finger painting:
<i>Mmmm, 98% operational efficiency. Recreational uplink in 953 seconds
- woof. Milchcow rendezvous in seven orbits - drool</i>. <P>The sat has a number of tasks - comms routing, mildata storage, AI
backup - but, primarily, it's a gun. A big gun. Optimised for targeted,
non-radioactive orbital bombardment, the milsat is a fourth-gen geosync
platform built by WorkSpace in 2029 and leased to the US government for
the duration of Afghanistan 2.0. The sat has seen some service, crude
satisfaction routines humming with gratification as the dumb matter
kinetic missiles were deployed at hypersonic speeds from the blunt
muzzles of its EM accelerators. Expelled at speeds close to escape
velocity, the streamlined chunks of depleted plutonium that the sat uses
for ammunition require no explosive payload. Impacting at over twelve
kilometres per second, the dull grey rods of plutonium convey a impact
explosive analog of over 20 kilotons. With no gamma after-effects, the
weapons platform is the tool of choice for the discerning on-the-ground
US military coordinator. They even take it in turns, thrice-PHDed war
technicians squabbling over who gets to pull the trigger on a modified
PlayStation paddle from an invulnerable state-side bunker.  <P>Latterly, though, the military machine has moved on to oilier
pastures and the milsat has been backburnered to standard comms duties -
piggy-backing commercial TV feeds a dimly perceived jangle of irritating
bits. As the terminator creeps across the terrigenous skeleton of the
mountains of Afghanistan, and the morning brings some welcome relief
from the freezing spring night, the milsat wakes up to a rare but
extremely important ping: get ready to launch. Hard-coded
synapses
shiver alert with an anticipation of pseudo-pleasure - re-deployed it
may be, but the sat is a combat machine - they made it to want to fight.
Milliseconds later targeting data hits its buffer, a priority wrapper
indicates a desired completion timeframe for the action, an imperative
variable tells the sat that the order is reinforced with a WASTE
modifier, somewhere in WorkSpace someone (or probably more likely
somebot) has decided that a WorkSpace initiative has exceeded its
mandated usefulness. In the more litigiously nervous environment of the
developed world this would result in a cease and desist order and fund
withdrawal; out in the Middle East boondocks a more expedient MO is
used: explosive deconstruction and removal.  <P>The sat processes the targeting data: A geoloc overlay pinpoints the
bombardment coordinates, a more self-aware entity might puzzle over the
rationale and/or military significance of a near-deserted patch of poppy
plantation several kilometres south of Jalalabad, and a less capable
machine might doubt its ability to hit a tiny disused prefab. The milsat
is fully upgraded, though, and has a 94% success termination potential
for targets <0.5 metre square. 250 milliseconds following receipt of
directive its primary EM cannon is unfolding from its dormant
configuration. Fully three seconds thereafter a two metre needle of
ultrahard plutonium is making a ersatz shooting star in the dawn sky of
Afghanistan. Nearly an hour later (an aeon in machine time) the sat's
after-action scan detects a rising cloud of atomised rock and dust
rising into the morning sky. Its sensors are also sensitive enough to
detect in the particulate cloud the fatty-carbon remains of several
mammalian combatants, it also wonders briefly and unconcernedly about
the flash of machine thought coherence it detected just before missile
impact.  <P>Resource allocation is not one its core competencies, nor does is
possess combat morality algorithms. The sat powers down to dormant, to
again moronically eavesdrop the tsunami of commercial bandwidth flooding
its router. <P>Pardis Hospice is closed for business. <P><small>&copy; Jonathan Joseph 2011 All Rights Reserved </small>
