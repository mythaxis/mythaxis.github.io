<div><i>Serendipity at work in Snoak City.</i>
<p class="drop">Registered simply as the Trox Bequest,
the extraordinary object identified as the wine cup of Relf was now on
permanent display at the City Museum. The cost of ensuring the security of
this fabulous exhibit had been considerable, but was easily outweighed by the
sustained increase in sightseers and researchers from near and far, come to
marvel at the survival of an object known for so long only from ancient
records. <P>Following his fortuitous discovery,
Scanthan had sought to avoid unnecessary publicity, but he did not regret his
decision to make the exquisite little bowl available to public view, rather
than let it fall into the predatory clutches of Morton Quanderpyre. Had he
delayed donating it to the Museum, he suspected he might have put himself (and
possibly his sister Riadne, who had granted it temporary sanctuary) at risk of
being burgled. He knew that he must have incurred the entrepreneur&#146;s
displeasure by rejecting the offer of an inordinate amount of cash, and was
mildly uneasy for the following few weeks, fearing a ghastly retribution which
(whether the result of inertia, belated concern for reputation, or legal
advice) fortunately never materialised. He now felt safe enough to venture out
without resorting to camouflage.  <P>Garrible Park was a popular venue throughout the year. There was sufficient
shelter under the many exotic trees to attract people even in inclement
weather, but the lure of sunshine proved irresistible to Snoak City
residents and tourists alike. There were meandering paths to suit the solitary
walker, glades where couples might find some privacy, plenty of open space for
those more gregariously inclined.&#160; On that early afternoon in late summer many
lunches had already been unpacked and consumed. People lay, sat or sprawled in
the warmth, children gravitated to the exuberant shrieks and yells of the
dedicated play area. Seemingly oblivious to their noise, on a perimeter bench
perched a gaudily-hatted woman whose face was set in an expression of wary
truculence. From the south-east came a faint aerial chiming, as kite-flyers
gathered atop Thrissop Hill, striving to catch the thermals rising from the
lake-shore on the far side. This year most of the kites resembled
multicoloured jellyfish, their long tendrils festooned with aeolian bells.  <P>Propped on one elbow and squinting
through his unruly hair against the light, he took another ruminative sip from
the flask of soup Riadne had considerately provided. Not unwillingly, he had
become one of her test subjects. Definitely prawn and possibly courgette, he
thought, with hints of paprika and lime, and, as usual, a subtle aftertaste of
mingled flavours designed to surprise and satisfy the palate. Scanthan grinned
in admiration of his sister&#146;s undoubted culinary skill. A few metres away, a
young woman happened to look up from her 
<u onmouseover="Tip('Aubec Sparagulan&#146;s &#145;The Chain of Furcatives&#146;:' +
'his classic work on the mathematics underlying natural	forms')">
book</u>, and instinctively reciprocated what she took to be a friendly
smile
directed at
her.&#160; Caught unawares by her attention, Scanthan promptly choked on his
mouthful of soup. It was not the most romantic of introductions, but
Myris Prell was
charmingly solicitous, and once he was composed enough to apologize, any
initial awkwardness was forgotten, as they fell into an increasingly absorbing
conversation, initially about soup and sisters (she was the middle one of
three), which continued as they gathered up their things and he found himself
heading west with her towards Welfage Road. It was not on his usual route back
to the hydro lab and his carefully-tended plants, but that did not seem to
matter.  <P>They parted opposite the entrance to
Greeming &amp; Trulph, having somewhat bashfully exchanged contact details, and
Scanthan turned right into the maze of lanes leading through the street market
towards the domed octagonal complex of Central. He was feeling strangely
light-headed, and had to resist an unexpectedly childish impulse to skip. It
was not like the predictable hormonal surge that usually accompanied proximity
to a girl he found attractive. In the short time he had spent with this total
stranger, he had simply felt so much at ease that had she asked, he would
readily have trusted her with whatever he held precious. How could he
reconcile being at once so vulnerable and yet filled with a dreamlike sense of
invincibility? Unearthing that iridescent bowl and verifying its authenticity
had been as exhilarating as anything in his experience, but this ambiguous
sensation was puzzlingly new to him. <P><p class=drop>Myris had no time for such introspection,
as she was startled to see that through the elegant glass-panelled door (etched
in masterful calligraphy with the firm&#146;s name) the shop appeared to be on
fire. Swirls of bluish smoke shot through with flickers of vermilion filled
the interior. She reached down automatically for the sinuous twist of the
antique brass handle, but jerked her hand away at the last moment, realising
firstly that it might be too hot to touch, and more importantly that there
could be a danger of creating a fire-feeding draught. She could hear
coughing. Suppressing panic, she cautiously felt for the handle again. It was
still cold! As was the surface of the door. Despite the thickness of the
smoke the fire must have started recently, but it was odd that an alarm had not
been triggered. Another peculiarity, it occurred to Myris, was the coughing,
which had a very distinctive timbre, familiar to all who worked at Greeming
&amp; Trulph. It held no suggestion of distress, but was uncannily like the
punctuated wheezes habitually expelled by Mr Pellet while vouchsafing one of
his anecdotes.  <P>She reasoned that a conflagration of
whatever size in such safety-aware premises would be unlikely to provoke mirth,
even from the ever-cheerful Mr Pellet. The situation was therefore probably not
what it seemed. Taking a deep breath, Myris decided to open the door. At that
very moment, as if a switch had been thrown (as indeed it had), the smoke
vanished completely, revealing, quite unharmed, several of her colleagues,
including the irrepressible Ched Pellet, clustered around an adjustable cradle
in which there slowly revolved a compact holotoy, the kind favoured by
performers and partygoers alike as &#147;lending the atmosphere of your choice to
any event.&#148;  <P>&#147;Ah, Miss Prell,&#148; ventured Harvis Drile,
evidently flushed with success, &#147;we&#146;ve just been testing this little hoto. If
you&#146;d like a demonstration&#133;&#148; <P>Myris summoned a ruefully placating
smile, and explained that she had already spent a good few minutes just outside
the door in a state of mild terror, and would really appreciate having a little
quiet time to recover, if nobody minded. As she tried to adjust her thoughts
back to the working environment, she reflected that &#147;hoto&#148;, even though it was
a modern contraction, was one of those words that reminded her of a
particularly intense period of her childhood. Unbidden, curious fragmented
phrases sometimes drifted back into her thoughts, mostly long bereft of any
original significance<i>. &#147;Carrely slat. Yemi. Sneps. Hif hak haroam.&#148;</i>&#160;&#160; <P>
At quite an early age Myris Prell had
become concerned about the names of things. This was not an aberration in her
language development, which was demonstrably above average, but a sudden
realisation that what something was called was not the same as the thing
itself.&#160; Why &#145;bottle&#146; or &#145;feather&#146; or &#145;sky&#146;? Who had decided on those names?&#160;
Having no knowledge of etymology, she had both amused and perplexed her parents
by building up an alternative sing-song vocabulary of her own devising, finding
the most instinctively pleasing sounds to match qualities such as size, smell,
whether hard or soft, attractive or ugly, important or useless.&#160; It was no
mean achievement for a six-year old, even though Myris had tended to treat it
as a private game, practiced with a few admiring friends. The only word which
had retained its meaning over the years was &#147;<i>Froosh</i>&#148;, signifying
something she<i> really</i> liked. <P>When it became clear that no-one she knew
was really troubled by the issue, it gradually ceased to preoccupy her, but the
experiment certainly seeded the ground for her later linguistic studies at Sparagulan
 College. In any case, a spirit of enquiry was always encouraged at Greeming
&amp; Trulph, where, as any of her co-workers would confirm, there was hardly
ever a dull day.  <P><p class=drop>Ebby Blates had once been in the same
class as Myris, but their paths had soon diverged, and subsequently intersected
only by chance. Her need to know was of a different order. It was less philosophical,
more of a salacious itch to find out about other people&#146;s foibles and
possible
transgressions. In the classroom her inquisitive behaviour only rarely related
to her lessons. Among her peers, some found her entertaining, while those of a
more sensitive character regarded her as a busybody.  At length she
found a
suitable niche bagging goods at the Multimart, where she could exchange
snippets of gossip and embellish them creatively in the re-telling. A minor
injury might blossom into a near-death experience, an accidentally observed
meeting could easily betoken a furtive drug-deal. Anyone spotted away from
their usual haunts (perhaps innocently visiting a relative, or seeking to buy a
pedigree fish) could give rise to whispered speculation that they were looking
for sexual favours of an unusual nature, or even <i>working for the Quanderpyre
Press</i> (Ebby would breathe such allegations in a hoarse undertone in which
admiration and disapproval were indistinguishable).  <P>Incautiously pursuing her natural curiosity,
Ebby Blates was eventually rewarded by becoming pregnant twice in successive
years, and was now the mother of two rather unsociable small boys, Gerrit and
Ursen, named, in each case belatedly, after their respective absent fathers.&#160;
Although Snoak City provided nursery facilities, the boys were adept at
exhausting the tolerance of those entrusted with their care. Ebby knew that
when the morning&#146;s toll of damage to person or property threatened to exceed
normal limits, she would receive an emergency call, firmly suggesting that her
sons would benefit from a change of venue. On such occasions, partly in an
attempt to tire them out, and on the strict understanding that they would cause
no further distress, she would take them to the park, where they would duly
clamber, whirl, bounce and slide on the apparatus provided. It was also an
excuse for her to settle on a bench for a spell of observation, under the
apotropaic shelter of one of her elaborate hats. These hats were
typically vivid
and often complex abstract collages, lovingly fashioned by her own busy fingers
with very little sense of style. Ebby would have scoffed at the idea that this
was a form of art therapy, but there was no doubt that while under construction
her bizarre millinery afforded her a kind of respite from anxieties, and
thereafter furnished a range of protective headgear which she felt certain was
teasingly provocative.  <P>The eyes of Ebby Blates flickered into
scanning mode from beneath a spray of brightly-dyed pigeon feathers set with
metallic beads and pleated tufts of material that looked like the desiccated
carcasses of sea-horses. She could see no-one she knew, but was content enough
to eavesdrop on passing conversations as people drifted along the path. <P><i><font size=-1>&#147;&#133;nodded off before the end of the second act, but at
least we saw Heb
Trogan&#133;&#148;
<br>&#147;&#133;the
one who plays the slatted ghalk?&#148;
<br>&#147;The
very same. He&#146;s <b>so</b> good.. And you&#146;ll never guess who was sitting
behind us&#133;&#148;</font></i> <P><i><font size=+1>&#147;Crusel,
stop dawdling!&#160; Yes, you are! Hurry up. If we miss the pod, it&#146;s a long wait
until the next one, and then we won&#146;t even have enough time for &#145;Hunt the
Wugget&#146; with Manzy.&#148;</font></i> <P><b>&#147;&#133;
but by then it was so hot that the seeds exploded, and the poor girl had to
spend the rest of the morning scuttling about on hands and knees like a
demented crab&#133;&#148;</font></b> <P><tt>&#147;&#133;
of course I said no. My uncle&#146;s a Detech, and you know how hopelessly
unreliable Zole can be. I told him if <b>that&#146;s</b> his idea of a sensible
plan, take it to Smatparrox and feed it to a biotap! In any case,

at the back of the neck, and all down the legs, especially if I&#146;m sitting near
a window, but you know I&#146;m not one to moan. Wish I hadn&#146;t worn these wretched
shoes, though. They&#146;ll give me blisters the size of poached eggs&nbsp;&#133;&#148;
</font></i> <P><font face=sans-serif>&#147;&#133;
decided yet, but definitely a pool of opalescence deepening to indigo, and a
hint of menace as the dark bulk of that enigmatic structure rises like a
gigantic cactus, fringed on one side with minute points of
light&#133;.&#148;
<br>&#147;&#133;coinciding with the faint swell of the basso profundo, before the
start of&#160;
Hetmoot&#146;s aria&#133;&#148;
<br>&#147;&#133;which
reminds me, we&#146;ll need to arrange a meeting with Aurelian before the
next&#133;&#148;</font> <P><font face=serif>&#147;Yes
you did!&#148;<br>&#147;Didn&#146;t&#148;<br>
&#147;Did!&#148;<br>&#147;Didn&#146;t&#148;<br>&#147;I&#146;m
telling !&#148;</font> <P>
From behind her ornamented head the
petulant cries of her progeny rose unmistakably above the background hubbub.&#160;&#160;
With a resigned sigh Ebby detached herself from the bench, and prepared to
collect them. She rummaged for a couple of placatory biscuits. Fortunately
she had a good stock of quikpaks at home &#150; one of the perks of working at the
Multimart &#150; so there would be minimal fuss over lunch. As she turned, she
happened to notice silhouetted against the sky a vaguely familiar figure
stooping over a seated fair-haired man who looked as if he was having some sort
of fit. She was still trying to remember the woman&#146;s name as she opened the
gate to release the boys, but was sure it would come back to her. <P>Far above their heads a stray kite,
caught by crosscurrents, began falling in slow lazy swoops, billowing and
shrinking by turns, finally coming to rest, as if spent, in the upper branches
of a Japanese maple, from where its intermittent chiming continued
to trickle
like an uncertain benison over the park&#146;s inhabitants. <P><p class=drop>Scanthan managed to navigate his way
through the rest of the day without causing accidental damage to delicate
equipment or interpreting any readings incorrectly. He was disciplined enough
at work not to be distracted by his feelings, conscious that he was responsible
for the health of all specimens under propagation, and was scrupulously
vigilant when it came to detecting unwanted pathogens. He also routinely
supervised regular checks of nutrient supplies and pH values, while ensuring
the labtechs maintained pumps, drainage, lighting and temperature at optimal
levels. At the hydro lab the results of their research was of potential
benefit to several agencies; horticultural, agricultural and pharmaceutical.&#160;
One of Scanthan&#146;s predecessors, Eo Ormert, had inadvertently introduced a trace
of soil into the nutrient flow, resulting in the catastrophic loss of an entire
crop; a disaster from which necessary lessons had been learned. The lab
was now equipped with phytoalexin-inducers (to stimulate plants&#146; natural
defence systems), along with a range of anti-microbial compounds, surfactants,
ultraviolet lamps and slow sand-filtration units. <P>He looked up into the early evening sky.&#160;
A couple of stars were already visible. Across his line of sight a lone airship
glinted, fiery orange against the darkening blue, heading north-east, probably
to Platport. On his way home Scanthan considered his options. Outside the
controlled environment of the lab it had been a warm day. He needed a shower
and a change of clothes, then a quick snack before seeing whether his friends
Jaunx or Boddo wanted to join him for a drink at that new place in Prossing Street. If they felt more energetic, there was always the glider track, or they
could go for a swim. Alternatively, he could have a quiet night in; there was
no shortage of home entertainment, and there were a few things he had been
meaning to catch up on. Reaching home, he stood irresolutely before his door,
key in hand, knowing that he wasn&#146;t being entirely honest with himself. He let
himself in, thumbed his e-screen. <P><i>&#147;Myris, hello!&#148; <P>&#147;Oh, Scanthan! Is everything all right?&#148; <P>&#147;Um, yes.. Look, I didn&#146;t intend to&#133;
I mean, well, the truth is, I can&#146;t stop thinking about
you&#133;&#148; </i> <P>There was a pause, during which he had time enough to wonder whether the
lovely face on his screen was looking puzzled, amused or discomfited.
One hand briefly obscured her lips as she said something which he
thought he had misheard.  It sounded rather like <i>"Froosh!"</i> <P>
