[*ITEM] Maximum Law

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark
													 
[*BLURB] Shades of William Gibson's GUNHEAD from 'Virtual Light'.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>Rolling in the deep, wired to the max. Adele
playing on Retro FM, Jim
driving, me hugging the 12-gauge to my chest, head bobbing in time to the
beat. We were both fired up on Godz - methamphetamine with a ketamine
bumper - and feeling pretty damn invincible.
</p>
<p>
Maximum Law, baby, that's who we work for. We got the warrants, we got the
vests, we got the guns, we got the armoured four-by-four. You diss me, you
call me rent-a-cop and I <i>will</i> hurt you, so be warned. We're private
security, bail bondsmen, bounty hunters, skip tracers. We're the real deal.
If local law enforcement is too overworked or just plain indifferent, then
we're the crew who come calling, and we take no shit. 'Your safety in our
hands' is our corporate motto and, man, you better believe it. If we're not
there then no one else is coming.
</p>
<p>
Jim and I were riding through Lakeside after dark. It's a dilapidated,
low-rent housing project, home to white trash - and trash of just about any
other hue you care to mention. I didn't see any signs of multi-cultural
harmony though. Just a slew of wannabe street gangsters split along ethnic
lines. I was buzzing, getting this great vapour-trail visual from the
streetlights. On the downside, my teeth felt too large for my head and I
had to sit with my mouth wide open. We were rolling slow, windows down,
scoping the streets for Laney, tonight's target of choice.
</p>
<p>
The way I heard it, Laney was just a two-bit hustler who started punching
way above his weight. Danny Craig, who treated Lakeside as his personal
fiefdom, sent 'round a negotiating team to put across his point of view
with extreme prejudice. To give him his due, Laney saw this coming and
trumped Craig's tooled-up hard men with a one-shot anti-tank launcher.
Result - one burnt out Subaru and three unrecognisable corpses. He followed
this up with a grenade through Danny's front window, costing the big man an
eye and his four-year-old daughter. Craig ran out into the street, carrying
his girl in his arms, and got run down by the arriving ambulance. That's
what lack of depth perception will do for you.
</p>
<p>
If Laney had been more than just a wide-boy with access to army ordnance,
he might have pulled it off. The rest of Craig's operation might just have
fallen in line behind the new kingpin and that would have been an end to
it. Unfortunately, none of Craig's lieutenants were prepared to take orders
from, well, anyone. This kicked off a protracted bout of territorial
adjustment and they were still digging bodies out of the landfill site near
Morton. As the case against Laney was all hearsay and the Police had their
hands full stomping on bona fide drug dealers, they kicked his file back to
us.
</p>
<p>
Cue Unit Two, Jim and me, cruising the streets after a tip-off that Laney
was wrapping things up with a view to heading for pastures new. The clubs
where he usually did business were all under electronic surveillance, so if
he wanted cash he'd have to stiff his street contacts pronto.
</p>
<p>
My eyes itched, but I couldn't rub them as we were both wearing DataSkin
contact lenses. I licked my lips. "I want a strawberry shake. There's a
drive-through McD at Cuckoo Bridge. It's less than a mile."
</p>
<p>
Jim grinned, although he was gripping the wheel so hard his knuckles turned
white. "You're addicted to that crap, Matt. Why don't you-" His head jerked
round. "On your ten. I got a shimmer-sheen."
</p>
<p>
I locked-on, and sure enough, there was a human-shaped blur walking across
the wide sweep of pavement fronting a row of shops. To the naked eye the
figure appeared invisible, just a trick of the light. However, our sensor
package was as near military grade as the shimmer-suit itself. I laughed,
more of a giggle really, and took a deep breath. "Laney, you sad sack! Come
quiet. Don't make us nail your ass in front of all these nice people."
</p>
<p>
The row of youths over by the railings looked up, and the figure stopped,
turning to face us. Jim pulled up and killed the radio, his fingers
drumming an irregular beat on the worn leather wheel cover. "I say we taser
him, just on general principle. Say we were in fear of our lives and stiff
him with a resisting arrest surcharge. He's gotta' be good for it, and the
bounty on this clown isn't that great to begin with."
</p>
<p>
I grinned. "I like your way of thinking, my man, so-"
</p>
<p>
The figure flared and there was Laney, wearing a long coat with hood,
little fading sparks dancing across the surface. He hauled out - I kid you
not - twin machine-pistols and opened up, blazing away in
<i>&uuml;ber</i>
-Matrix fashion.
</p>
<p>
Jim flicked a switch. "Shields up. Jesus, will these people never learn?"
</p>
<p>
"Laney! Cut that out!"
</p>
<p>
The swarm of bullets hit our inertia field and slowed, leaving red smoking
trails as their momentum burnt off. The spent rounds began to hit;
<i>pok-pok-pok</i> against the bodywork, but with as much effect as
ping-pong balls. When his guns went empty Laney cast them aside and simply
vanished.
</p>
<p>
Jim frowned. "What kind of shit is this?"
</p>
<p>
I stuck my head out the window. "Where'd he go?"
</p>
<p>
"I got nothing on scope."
</p>
<p>
"Laney! Stop buggering about." The locals started up with cat-calls and
ironic clapping, and I wasn't in the mood. "Kill the field, I'm going out."
</p>
<p>
My skin prickled as the residual static earthed through me, but I ignored
it. The DataSkins relayed the sensor information from the car, compensating
for relative position. This gave me specs for low-light enhancement,
wire-frame outline, infrared, and electromagnetic overlay. But even with
these specs the street was 'empty'. I turned back towards the car where my
partner was still dicking with the sensor sensitivity. "Jim, I got zip.
Tell me it's a systems glitch, yeah?"
</p>
<p>
He pointed down the street, stubbing his finger on the inside of the
windscreen. "Shit. Down there, look."
</p>
<p>
I looked and the same outline shimmered as before. I figured some kind of
scramble pulse, maybe, but it hardly mattered. The shotgun settled snug
into my shoulder. I could have nailed him then, but I liked his style.
"Laney, give it up man. You're worth more alive than dead, but dead
<i>is</i> acceptable. You hear me? I got you cold."
</p>
<p>
"You sure about that, bud?"
</p>
<p>
The voice came from close behind. As I turned to look, Laney shot me in the
back. I coughed and staggered forward. Laney shot me twice more as I fell
to the pavement.
</p>
<p>
The shimmering figure down the street turned into a girl -    <i>Jones,
Veronica</i>, according to my virtual display. She was holding a
short tube the same way you'd carry an awkward roll of wallpaper. Laney's
file said he went for street-wise girls who knew how to handle a weapon,
but his latest squeeze was clearly a gun-shy amateur. On this occasion,
he'd gone for eye-candy over killer. He'd gone for tits over tactical
acumen and they both paid the price.
</p>
<p>
Veronica shrieked as the weapon fired; a stab of back-blast and the
anti-tank round flashed across the road to ricochet off the tarmac. It
detonated in a disused mailbox with a curiously flat <i>bang</i> that
barely rattled the surrounding windows. Shards of flying metal spread
comfort and joy in all directions, but none hit the car.
</p>
<p>
Laney roared with anger, and Veronica dropped the spent launcher like the
proverbial hot potato. Before she could say anything Jim tapped her,
one-two, using the camera gun housed in our car's engine space. He swears
by it but I just swear <i>at</i> it, finding the little joystick way too
awkward. It was probably more accurate than getting out to use his 9mm,
though I suspect he was just showing off.
</p>
<p>
Veronica fell to the ground in a heap, a puppet with the strings cut. In
full avenging angel mode, Laney pulled a grenade from an inside pocket,
fumbling with the pin while keeping hold of his pistol. Jim bailed, ducking
down behind the vehicle, unaware of the danger. In a couple of seconds he
would pop up and start firing, but by that time the grenade would have been
tossed through the door I'd left open.
</p>
<p>
On the ground I was hurting, as a vest can only do so much. Your standard
item is only good against small calibre or knife thrusts. You can go for
AmourGel, as used by army and special forces, but it's way too
uncomfortable to wear for any length of time while riding around. So
instead we use Straub Containment Harness. It has the same kind of stopping
power as regular ballistic cloth but with a twist. The elastic lining is
drawn into the body by the bullet, forming a tube. Then it snaps back into
shape, expelling the spent round and chemically cauterising the wound tract
as it does so. You're still history if it's a major organ and it's no help
with broken bones, but at least you won't bleed to death.
</p>
<p>
Lying there I could feel the movement inside me. The Straub is supposed to
have a built-in local anaesthetic, but it was a lot like being stabbed,
only in reverse. My breathing was ragged, so there was a lung wound for
starters. But at least I could move.
</p>
<p>
I rolled over, clutching my 12-guage, coughed by way of witty rejoinder,
and fired. None of your buckshot crap either. I was using solid shell with
flechette load, proximity spread. At point-blank range the round detonated
immediately, drowning out the shotgun roar. The shoal of barbed-steel
projectiles shredded Laney from groin to chest and he collapsed,
<i>slithered</i>, to the ground in a bloody mass. No last words either,
as
his lungs had burst.
</p>
<p>
The grenade spun to a stop between my legs, the pin still in place.
</p>
<p>
I took a deep breath that didn't hurt too bad.
</p>
<p>
Jim appeared at my shoulder and helped me to my feet before stooping to
retrieve Laney's weapons. He laughed. "Hell, dog, when you put a man down
he <i>stays</i> down." I managed a thin smile, but my voice was still on
hold. My partner raised his voice. "Camera!"
</p>
<p>
The tailgate came up automatically and our camera drone wafted out. It
sidled up, mini-turbofans whirring, and started snapping away. I struck a
pose with my shotgun by way of promo shot before limping back to the car.
Flopping down I slapped on another dermal jolt of Godz, plus one of Bliss
to improve my general sense of well-being. Time dissolved for a moment.
When my surroundings snapped back into focus Jim was in the driving seat
and the camera was zooming home.
</p>
<p>
I pulled the door closed with that heavy <i>clunk</i> of armour plate that
always gives me a shiver, a sense of security. The comms console
squawked.    <i>"Unit Two, this is Central."</i>
</p>
<p>
Man, she has <i>such</i> a sexy voice, and was probably chosen for that
very reason. We'd never met her, of course, and I suspected that reality
wouldn't shape up to the ideal woman in my head. Jim answered. "Central,
Unit Two receiving."
</p>
<p>
<i>
"Nice job boys. We had your live feed on the big screen back here and
the censored version will definitely generate some reality TV revenue.
Photo analysis confirms the target as being Desmond 'Diamondback'
Laney, and, pending DNA confirmation, we've forwarded a claim for
bounty payment. Nothing for the girl though, she was clean sheet. Just
to reassure you that initial review by management and independent
assessor have rated your use of lethal force as justified. You'll have
to give a statement to local law enforcement, but that's just a
formality&#8230;How's Matthew? We saw his biometrics take quite a hit."
</i>
</p>
<p>
Jim glanced over at me. "Shot three times but still as bad-ass as ever. The
guy is plain indestructible."
</p>
<p>
She laughed.
<i>
"Glad to hear it. Now, we have a suspected home invasion in Fairview.
Unit four is en route and has requested back-up."
</i>
</p>
<p>
Fairview was a series of up-market gated communities not two miles away,
ostentatious wealth in incongruous contrast to the urban squalor of
Lakeside. The bonus for riding to the rescue of the rich and famous made
this a prime call-out. Jim raised an eyebrow and I nodded. "No problem,
Central, show us as responding."
</p>
<p>
<i>
"Unit Two confirmed. Just make sure Matthew gets a full medical at end
of shift, OK? We worry about you boys. Central out."
</i>
</p>
<p>
Jim fired up the engine, revving it until the vehicle trembled. We pulled
away with a squeal of run-flat tyres. Local police and a meat wagon would
be arriving at some point to clean up our mess, but that was part of the
price they paid for privatisation.
</p>
<p>
I hit the radio. Retro FM again; 'Clubbed to Death' this time - mood music
right on the button. We drove on. I hit the lights and siren. A thumping
base line and enough pharmaceuticals in my system to qualify me as a drug
mule. The grin on my face couldn't get any wider. The shotgun felt cool and
slick in my hands.
</p>

[*COMMENT]===============================================

[*ITEM] Commedia del'l Venezia

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson
													 
[*BLURB] “I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs; A palace and a 
prison on each hand.” <br /><small>Lord Byron</small>.
 
[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>The ancient city of Venice, as everybody
knows, is an island inside a lagoon at the northern end of the Adriatic.
The island is divided into two by the Grand Canal, which zigs, zags and
zigs from north to south in the shape of a lazy figure 2. The city
traditionally governed an area of north east Italy, and over many
centuries was a major naval, mercantile, financial and colonial power.
For most of its history, it was an independent state, and it
maintained this spirit of independence even while it was passed back and
forth between Italy and Austria for a while.
<P>
Italy fumbled the ball when their financial problems with the EU could
no longer be ignored, and Venetian public works were said to be
bankrupting the nation. So Italy tried to sell Venice to the highest
bidder. There were no takers, but the city staged a sort of management
buy-out, and now we have what we always wanted - actual independence,
like
Scotland and Catalonia. We have re-invented ourselves as a nation state,
a free port and a tax haven, much more profitable and respectable than
our previous occupation - tourist trap. The waterbuses, still known as
'vaporetti', no longer roar and fume as they did when I was a child. An
electric whine propels them smoothly along the canals.
<P>
This is not the Venice of the early twenty-first century, with three
million tourists a year. This is the Venice of the late
twenty-first century, more resembling the Venice of the nineteenth
century Grand Tour, where the majority of visitors were scholars,
artists and writers. Most of us who work in Venice also live here.
<P>
On a chilly, bright, November morning, I was walking towards my place of
work along the Fondamenta Cannaregio, alongside the canal on my left. I
remembered, when I was a child, seeing egrets spearing tiny fish where I
was now walking. Looking like tiny herons, egrets are naturally nervous
birds, but they took advantage of Venice's <I>acqua alta</I> in which
seasonal high tides caused the city to be regularly flooded. Sirens and
other alarms accompanied these floods. The high tides seldom invaded
homes to a very great extent. Nevertheless, many households opted to
abandon the ground floors of their dwellings, and moved upstairs on a
permanent basis. I reflected that <I>acqua alta</I> was a thing of the
past now, the Tidal Harness project having, at one stroke, solved both
the flooding problem and part of the city's need for electric power.
<P>
Or so I thought. Even as I checked my x-pda e-mail on the hoof, a
strange, low-pitched creaking noise from across the water attracted my
attention. The ominous groan was followed by the graceful collapse of a
building into the canal. This surprising event was accompanied by a
minor <i>tsunami</i>, and I was briefly standing up to the knees in what
was once egret territory. An electric water taxi was flung against a
moored delivery vessel and nearly overturned. This was, at one stroke,
irritating and interesting. Most of the water returned to the canal
quite rapidly, leaving only a few centimetres in nearby shops and in my
shoes. This latter inconvenience was forgotten in the shock at having
witnessed  some hundreds of tons of masonry arriving in a navigable
waterway. A queue of <i>vaporetti</i>, cargo barges, water taxis, and
siren-wielding police and fire launches accumulated around the blockage.
In due course, rumour reported that the building had been empty and that
no-one was injured or missing. I moved away from the scene when a
heavy-duty barge with a huge JCB backhoe on its foredeck was towed into
place and started to clear the channel. The barge was tilted acutely
forward due to the weight of the digger, and the whole vessel wobbled
alarmingly from side to side as the JCB transferred masonry to the
barge's open hold, but Venetian engineers have always regarded this kind
of waterborne operation as business as usual.
<P>
Having fortified myself with a <I>caffè corretto</I> in a local café, I
texted my deputy Tomas that I was returning home to change my
trousers, socks and shoes. When I left home again, it was nearly
lunchtime. Lunch beckoned, I answered the call. I deserved a good lunch.
<P>
That was why it was mid-afternoon by the time I walked past the scene of
the accident again. The quayside was swarming with spectators and
officials. I was told that it had been the old Finance Administration
office, empty and under renovation. Heads were going to roll, I heard.
Bribery and corruption of high officials was suspected. I discounted
most of this. Whilst high crimes and misdemeanours have always been a
feature of Venetian life, I find stupidity to be a more common cause of
disasters like this. Like many of the buildings in Venice, the Finance
Administration office had started life as a church. By the time Venice
became independent thirty years ago, many churches had been repurposed
as theatres, art galleries, museums, even supermarkets, but church
architecture rendered them rather unsatisfactory as offices.
<P>
Meanwhile, the canal was navigable in single file. A couple of policemen
were attempting to organise traffic flow with the aid of flags and
megaphones, but since ACTV waterbuses are now driverless, the change in
canal geography confused their software, while flags were perceived as
moving obstructions, and the waterbuses
plunged forwards and backwards
without making any progress. Similarly, a convoy of driverless barges
was complicating the issue behind the jam.

Venetian boatmen are a law unto
themselves, however, and the
frantic signals were largely ignored by any boat with a driver,
priority of passage through the
narrow channel being determined by size or manouevreability	of vessel
and by how loud and threatening were their airhorns or the shouts of
their drivers.
<P>
My cell rang. It was Tomas. "Where are you, boss? You were going to get
here before lunch."
<P>
"Nearly there. What's the problem?"
<P>
"Palumbo is looking for you. I told him you'd had an accident and you'd
be in soon."
<P>
I wasn't used to being pressurised in this job. Chief Security Officer
for a multinational company headquarters sounded impressive enough, but,
in practice, it hadn't been particularly onerous. I was a fugitive from
the Carabinieri - Italy's military police. Not in the sense of being
pursued by them, but as an ex-employee who had succeeded in getting a
nice job in civic society.  Checking personnel for identity and criminal
history?  My previous career helped there. Making sure access to the
building was electronically controlled and wiring the building up with
surveillance cameras and a control room? The contract awarded to a local
firm. Did I accept a modest reward for choosing a particular security
company? Of course I did. Suspicions would have arisen if I hadn't.
<P>
The office. A venerable palazzo with an abandoned, slightly sunken, 
ground floor and a well-worn, marble, dramatic, staircase to the inhabited 
upper levels. Ancient floor tiles, stone window frames, marble and granite 
pediments, ceiling art, the whole Venetian
experience. The building is entered, however, through a mean little door in a gloomy
alleyway. The other side of the building faces - looms over - the canal. That side has a 
magnificent reconditioned water entrance, accessible only by boat, and used 
for the delivery of large items and the 
reception of VIPs.  
<P>
I made my way to the boss's opulent domain. The boss. One hundred and ten 
kilos of flesh, wrapped in an Armani suit.
A bullet head with tiny eyes and rubbery lips. To be deferred to and
addressed as Dottor Palumbo.
<P>
In addition to the boss, there were two other men in the boss's office
when I arrived. Vincenzo Grasso, the IT chief - skinny, sporting a beard
that would disgrace a nanny goat, no dress sense. And Luigi Lombardo,
the consultant architect, who advised on structural matters and building
regulation - smooth and elegant, clean hands. All eyes were on me.
<P>
Palumbo said: "Ah, Fabbri, at last. I hope we have not wrenched
you from the arms of your lover this afternoon."
<P>
I tried not to show any surprise that Palumbo knew about my occasional
lunchtime assignations and replied "Dottore, I was almost drowned this
morning. It is a miracle that I stand before you now."
<P>
"Don't lay it on too thick, Fabbri. I understand you witnessed a
building collapse this morning, and got your feet wet."
<P>
"Certainly, Dottore."
<P>
"How did it happen?"
<P>
"It seemed quite spontaneous."
<P>
"Spontaneous? What does that mean?
<P>
"As far as I can gather, the place just fell in the canal. It was closed
and unoccupied at the time. There
was no explosion. No warning. I was there."
<P>
"And why were you there?"
<P>
"Pure chance, Dottore. I had just got off the <I>vaporetto</I> at the
Guglie waterbus stop. I was on my way here. It was very shocking."
<P>
"Yes, well, Fabbri. We've all had a look. It's only a few hundred metres
away. Meanwhile, we have a serious situation here," said Palumbo, "There
have been threats."
<P>
"Threats?" I was floundering, trying not to show it.
<P>
Grasso broke in, his silly beard wagging: "Emails threatening
the stability of this building and promising a demonstration."
<P>
Lombardo said: "What he means is a demonstration such as you witnessed
this morning." This earned him a glare from Grasso.
<P>
I said: "Someone threatening to demolish this building? How many
emails?"
<P>
"A dozen or more over three months," said Palumbo.
<P>
"A dozen! I'm the security chief here. Why wasn't I told?"
<P>
"They were addressed to me. We didn't believe it," said Palumbo, "Not
until today."
<P>
Lombardo said: "It was news to me too, until today. I am only here
because I'm the architectural consultant. I understand building
stability."
<P>
"My decision," said Palumbo, "I was acutely aware that this kind of
thing could cause panic, and the fewer people knew about what was
probably a hoax, the better. Anyway, we have to take this seriously now.
Fabbri, you're in charge."
<P>
"Me?" I said.
<P>
"You, naturally. The security chief. I know that you do your work to
your own satisfaction, but it happens that you also do it to <i>my</i>
satisfaction. Take the lead for the three of you. Please do not involve
anyone else."
<P>
I said: "Are they asking for money?"
<P>
"<I>Of course</I> they are asking for money. It's extortion. We have
plenty of money, they want some, and we may end up having to pay, but I
am
relying on you three to make it unecessary. They've been sensible. It's
not a huge amount of money by the company's standards. About one day's
profit. But I can't pay it out just for the asking. Either bring these
guys to justice or at least determine that the threat is real and that
paying them will remove the threat, so I can justify the expenditure.
Now get on with it. Go!"
<P>
"Are you saying we should not involve the police?" I asked.
<P>
Palumbo's eyes bulged with fury: "Of course not! We don't want this all
over the newspapers! We can't afford any publicity."
<P>
"Got it, Dottore. Just wanted to check."
<p class=drop>I mentioned earlier that the company we worked for was a
multinational. Let me explain the title. It isn't just that the company
has a presence in many countries, trading in each country as a locally
incorporated subsidiary company. A multinational company also tends to
have a head office in a tax haven like Venice, Singapore or Grand
Cayman.
<P>
Now, each of the subsidiary companies decides how much tax they want to
pay to their host government, or, rather, how little and how late they
can get away with paying, bearing in mind that this is partly a
political calculation. How much does the host country value the
employment the company offers to its citizens (who then pay income tax),
or the support the company offers to sports events or charities (which
they, the government, are not keen to fund)? Then, no matter how much
gross profit the subsidiary actually makes, head office bills the
subsidiary for 'accountancy' services to reduce the net profit to the
desired level. Or, if this begins to look excessive, charges
outrageously high interest on 'loans' supposedly given to the
subsidiary.
<P>
So, the vast majority of the profit earned by the company as a whole
finishes up in the head office, and tax is paid at the local very small
tax rate. The vast sum of money is then lodged with an international
bank in, say, Switzerland, and subsequently used to buy up smaller rival
companies and to enrich the investors. Therefore, most of the head
office employees are high-powered accountants, international lawyers and
IT staff.
<P>
And don't think I disapproved of the company, which, to protect their
identity, I shall call "<b>Musestre</b>". They paid me generously for my
efforts, but it had begun to look as if I was about to earn my salary.
	
<p class=drop>In the boss's office, I had tried to look as if I
understood what was going on, but I didn't fully comprehend the threat
until we three gathered in Grasso's office to review some of the emails.
They were all a little different, but the message was always clear.
<P>
Until today, the messages had taken the form:
	
<blockquote><tt>From: avenger@collapso.org<br>

we receive the money within two hours of these instructions, we will
withdraw the threat. If you do not indicate your willingness to pay
within seven days of our demonstration, then you lose the opportunity to
buy your way out, and your building will fall apart. A four hour warning
will be given.<br>

Today's message was :

I said: "I see. Silly question... Have you traced avenger@collapso.org?"
<P>
Grasso sneered. "A silly question indeed. Naturally the server
collapso.org does not exist. I have not been
able to identify the sender, and none of our clever technicians can
suggest anything. Analysing the internet route backwards leads us into a
maze of redirects
which are intrinsically and
deliberately untraceable. Such VPNs, as they are called, are designed to
foil even governmental oversight. We use them ourselves for privacy
purposes. The originator could be anywhere from Mongolia to next door."
<P>
"Why do you think they are giving us so little time after giving us the
instructions for payment?"
<P>
"It's obvious. I imagine they are making sure we cannot plan to identify
them in the handover."
<P>
"Of course. Sorry. In that case, what if we don't pay, take the risk,
and just evacuate the building? We rent it. The problem devolves upon
the landlord."
<P>
A pained grin from Grasso. "I regret to inform you that the property
owner is a subsidiary of Musestre, insured by yet another subsidiary."
<P>
"What's the purpose of that?"
<P>
Another patronising smile from Grasso: "Accountancy. Tax dodge.
Legalised money laundering."
<P>
I turned to Lombardo and asked "As a consultant architect, I should ask
if it's even possible deliberately to bring a building to a state of
collapse like that?"
<P>
"Normally, no. Even though Venice is a special case. Believe it or not,
the entire city is supported on wooden piles driven through mud into the
clay below."
<P>
"Yes, I know, and I know that we are all sinking at half a millimetre or
so per year. But I hear that the wooden piles are effectively petrified,
as, in the absence of oxygen within the mud, they cannot rot."
<P>
"This is true, building collapses are almost unknown in Venice, unless
you count the campanile in 1902, which is why we initially discounted
the threat. But this event today... I must investigate. I have contacts
within the firm which was renovating the place."
<P>
"So, here we are. We have seven days to solve or surrender. Grasso, I
think you must prepare to put the signal on the contact page, but not
yet. Chat with the IT managers of other firms in Venice. Make no
reference to our problem, but one of your colleagues may let something
slip. Perhaps other companies may be under threat."
<P>
"That's not a new idea, Fabbri. I've been asking some discreet
questions. No response."
<P>
"Anything you need to do for your computers in the event of a collapse?"
<P>
"That's unthinkable. All the data about this company and all our branch
offices is contained in the computers on site here. You cannot
overestimate how vital and complex that data is."
<P>
"I think I can, Grasso. But isn't it backed up?"
<P>
"It's backed up, but only here. We could not afford to allow exterior
access to our data. The data centres - the original and the live backup
- have no connection to the outside world, so they cannot be hacked. The
problem with that is that although our eggs are in two baskets, both
baskets are in this building. We could not survive a building collapse
like the Finance Administration place this morning."
<P>
I turned to Lombardo. "And you will investigate the collapse today?
Could it have been accidental? I think you said you have contacts."
<P>
"Of course."
<P>
I suggested that we should meet here daily at ten in the morning. They
agreed.
<P>
Grasso set me up with an anonymised e-paq, which he remarked was
untraceable in much the same way as the system the blackmailers were
using. Then I spent the rest of the day on the internet, looking for
analogous cases. Extortion under threat of demolition turned out be
unknown, no matter how I posed the question. Grasso seemed gratified by
my failure, confiding that he had, in fact, already conducted a similar
search.
	
<p class=drop>In fact, to my surprise, Lombardo was as good as his word.
The next morning he appeared at our meeting with an ancient, blackened
piece of timber. It was a section about fifteen centimetres in length,
apparently sawn off a building support pile, roughly circular in
cross-section, one end splintered off. On close inspection, the whole
section, in particular the splintered end, was weakened by a mass of
microscopic holes, as if bored by tiny woodworms.
<P>
"So what am I looking at? Accidental or deliberate?" I asked.
<P>
"How could one tell?" said Grasso, "It could be anything."
<P>
Lombardo said: "It is very unusual. I do not know of any natural cause.
I have never seen damage like this. The Venice Conservation department,
which checks out all sorts of rot, pests, canal water or acid rain
damage are examining a sample like this. I have a contact in the
laboratory, so I should know this afternoon."
<P>
"Well done, Lombardo, keep up the good work." He glared. It seemed he
suspected me of patronising him. Grasso sniggered.
<P>
Nevertheless, Lombardo telephoned some hours later and arranged to meet
with me in a noisy bar near the office. In a hushed tone, barely audible
over the general row, he told me: "The news from the Conservation
Department is alarming."
<P>
"How so?"
<P>
"It appears that the damage to the collapsed building's piles may be the
work of nanorobots."
<P>
Having nothing to contribute, I just stared at him.
<P>
He continued: "Nanorobots are tiny microscopic machines that reproduce
each other and can be put to certain tasks."
<P>
"I know what nanorobots are, Lombardo. What do you think they use in the
manufacture of quantum computers, the conversion of sewage, the
purification of water, the removal of particulates and heavy metals from
our air-con units? Are you telling me our nanorobots have gone mad and
are eating the foundations of buildings?"
<P>
"No. They appear to be a specialist type that have been introduced."
<P>
"And are they now spreading to every building in the city?"
<P>
"Apparently not. They have a short life. I understand Venice
Conservation are pursuing this, based on the examples the laboratory
has. But not within the timescale we are working to."
<P>
"So we're screwed."
<P>
"It seems so. Has Grasso made any progress with the emails?"
<P>
"Not as far as I know," I said.
<P>
"I didn't think he would. I don't like the little turd."
<P>
"He's all we've got on the IT front."
<P>
I checked with Grasso before leaving work. He and a couple of his
techies were wading through a terabyte of internet logs, looking for a
clue to the identity of the blackmailers. He did not look hopeful. He
showed no interest in the news from Lombardo.
	
<p class=drop>Day 2: The ten o'clock meeting was cancelled. Lombardo
couldn't make it. Grasso said he wasn't surprised the pompous ass had
nothing new. He named a few other IT managers who might have been
threatened. He was going to have a friendly chat with them, and see if
anything came up in conversation.
<P>
While I knew I couldn't talk to outsiders about the extortion, the
collapse of the Financial Administration building was the talk of the
city. Most of the flippant conversations centred around the symbolic
significance of Financial Administration being all at sea, a total
washout, unstable, or requiring a thorough clean out.
<P>
I was feeling some frustration, and needed to talk to a scientist in
general terms. I knew where my American friend and general manager of
the Tidal Harness, Tommy Hay (TH of the TH as he styled himself), would
be at lunch-time that day. The golf club. An unexpected, century-old,
gem of a course, set in woods at the far end of the Lido. It features
the only hill I've ever seen in Venice, about fifteen metres in height.
<P>
I took a water taxi all the way to the little marina outside the club.
<P>
Tommy was, as predicted, relaxing with a beer in the clubhouse. After a
few pleasantries about the weather (excellent) and his golf
(disappointing), he felt the need to boast about the Tidal Harness.
<P>
"Forget solar energy! A few one-metre tides generated enough lunar
energy to operate the barrier to prevent the lagoon flooding due to the
same tides. I wonder we aren't slowing the moon down, all the energy
we're sucking out of it!"
<P>
That said, he appeared to realise that I had questions on my mind, and
raised an eyebrow.
<P>
"The collapse of the Financial Authority building..." I began.
<P>
"Hah! Yes! Very strange and unexpected, of course. Not that the fellows
at the Financial Administration are terribly upset. They hated that
office! Still, it's a puzzle. Since the Tidal Harness was started up,
building erosion due to high tides is almost unknown."
<P>
"Quite. I've heard that the piles in the foundations may have been eaten
away by nanorobots."
<P>
"Preposterous! Where did that idea come up?"
<P>
"Just a rumour, but I've heard that there's some evidence."
<P>
"Well, a few years ago, there was talk of using stuff like that to
remove derelict piles that were clogging up a canal, but nothing came of
it. It was Venice Conservation's show, really. I was just involved on
behalf of the Harness project."
<P>
"So the technology exists?"
<P>
"Sure. Some Indonesian company developed the idea to deal with mangrove
roots in navigable waterways. Hell, that's not the sort of thing anyone
should let loose in Venice."
<P>
"I agree. But what if...? Can it be targeted, then stopped?"
<P>
"OK. Well, if I remember, international regulations limit the number of
generations the machines can reproduce, so that the nanorobots can't run
amok. To use them you'd have to continuously supply new starter
cultures. It was going to be awkward enough to use them in a dredging
operation. To use them inside the city would be lunacy."
<P>
The converation drifted away into discussion of the proposed, but
endlessly discussed, offshore windfarms and solar panels feeding a huge
storage battery on one of the islands, reducing Venice's need to buy
electricity from Italy. Every Venetian could hold forth for hours on the
subject.
	
<p class=drop>Back at the office, I went to the IT department to talk to
Grasso. He wasn't there, but I spoke to one of the techies who had been
helping him earlier. According to him, they had found no sign of the
origin of the threatening e-mails. "Strange," he said. "I'd expected to
recognise a source VPN. The most recent IP on the e-mails doesn't
exist." 
<P> 
There was an e-mail for me from Tommy Hay, however. It
read:
<blockquote><tt> Hi, I found contact information on that
nanorobot company. It's Malaysian, not Indonesian. Kuala Belait Trading
Company. The contact is Mahmud Rahman, really great guy, attach his
card. You're up to something.  Tell me about it some day.<br>
Tommy.</tt></blockquote> 

<P> 
The time in Malaysia would be after office
hours. I'd call tomorrow. Besides, I had Commedia dell'Arte to go to.
And the Commedia turned out to be important in this story. 
<P> The
Venice Marionette Theatre was a brilliant new concept in the traditional
art of Commedia dell'Arte. It was a small theatre in a Palazzo that had
once been used for temporary exhibitions. The Isola di Pinocchio company
produced a different play every month, some from the 17th century canon,
others newly written in the traditional style, some modelled on modern
comedies. All were full of witty contemporary comment, and presented by
suitably beautiful string puppets, some of the villains caricaturing a
close resemblance to prominent Venetians. 
<P> The Commedia depends on a
limited number of stock characters in an infinite variety of
situations, and it was a monthly treat to be entertained. Seats were in
great demand; I wasn't prepared to miss tonight's performance. 
<P> As
usual, the plot hinged on conspiracies, accidents, disguise,
misunderstandings, love, greed, hatred, slapstick and sentimentality.
Just like life, in fact.
	
<p class=drop>Day 3: I called Mahmud Rahman, whose information confirmed
Tommy's memory of Kuala Belait Trading Company's contact with the Venice
Conservation department.
<P>
Then I made a Skype call to an old Carabinieri colleague in Rome, an
expert in IT fraud, asking him about tracing e-mails. He confirmed that
faking the apparent sender of an e-mail was simple, and while internet
service providers may disclose client information to governmental
authorities, they always take their time about it. The conclusion? You
cannot find the originator of an email in our timescale.
<P>
I went down to the busy accountancy section of Musestre, where dozens of
honest professionals worked the daily miracle of legally defrauding
foreign governments of their legitimate tax revenue. My enquiries led me
to Irina, who specialised in squirrelling away the money Musestre
accumulated.
<P>
"Can you spare the time to satisfy my curiosity, Irina. As Security, I
think it's important that I know these things."
<P>
"Whatever you like," said Irina, a very young woman to be in charge of
all these billions.
<P>
"I'd like to ask about something we read about in books, where criminals
transfer money to a bank account, and that money is immediately and
secretly whisked away into untraceable accounts elsewhere."
<P>
"And you suspect someone here?"
<P>
"Not at all. This is strictly for my own information. We security people
must be aware of these hazards."
<P>
"Hmm... I suddenly discover that I'm busy right now. Do you mind if we
discuss this over lunch?"
<P>
I was taken aback. "That's fine. Which restaurant do you prefer?"
<P>
"No. No. We'll go to the panini place in the square, and eat outside.
OK?"
<P>
"I know where you mean. Twelve?"
<P>
"Fine."
<P>
I was waiting outside the baguette and panini bar at five to twelve,
watching two kittens playing 'Tear Your Throat Out', between taking
catnaps curled up around each other. Irina arrived late. We ordered.
<P>
She said: "I wanted to discuss this with you privately because
this is not the first time someone has asked me about this. Someone
yesterday asked me to prepare for an urgent cash
transfer to an account, possibly foreign, with his authority, no
paperwork."
<P>
I said: "Our esteemed leader, Mario Palumbo."
<P>
"You know about this?"
<P>
"Yes. And, as far as the company is concerned, it will be a justified
expenditure."
<P>
"That's a relief. What's it all about?"
<P>
"I can't tell you that, but tell me about these untraceable accounts."
<P>
"It's not as easy as people think, and it's pretty expensive, and it
takes a while, but here's how it usually works. It's not really my
line. The people in the computer department are the best to ask."
<P>
"In summary?"
<P>
"Well, you contact one of a number of organisations who advertise on the
internet. For a fee, they set up a number, at least two, of shell
companies in countries with loose banking laws - like Venice is these
days. Each company has at least one offshore bank account."
<P>
"Shell company?"
<P>
"A company in name only. Doesn't really trade, just accepts and
disburses money, covering the transactions with fake invoices and
receipts. It has to be done in an administration where transfers of
greater than $10,000 do <i>not </i>have to be reported."
<P>
"I see."
<P>
"When the money arrives in the first account, the shell company
transfers it to another shell company, usually in another country, in
payment of a fake invoice, and so on, and when the money ends up in its
destination, the final company issues debit cards so that the owner of
the chain can spend the money."
<P>
"Simple."
<P>
"Not so very simple. It's expensive. Often the arranger takes an upfront
fee and as much as twenty percent of the money transferred, and it's
illegal, but seldom prosecuted or even detected. There are plenty of
apparently respectable people who live on these accounts."
<P>
"Thank you, Irina. What you are telling me is that it's entirely
possible and virtually undetectable."
<P>
"Quite so. Tell me, Fabbri, is this anything to do with the Financial
Authority building?"
<P>
"Why do you ask?"
<P>
"Well, I've seen a lot of that Luigi Lombardo this week, and he was in
charge of the FA building renovation."
<P>
"No, no. He was nothing to do with that. What made you think so?"
<P>
"I'm in constant touch with the FA over technical matters. It's an open
secret over there."
<P>
"Hmmm. I knew he had contacts with them. I hadn't realised he was so
deeply involved. It's really rather delicate. I'd rather you said
nothing to anyone else. Another coffee?"
<P>
"No thanks. I have some shopping to do. Thanks for lunch!"
<P>
I spent part of the afternoon in the Venice Conservation Department. I
was passed from official to official, but no-one would talk to me about
the FA building. I spent most of my wasted time in the planning
department.
<P>
Finally, since I was in the area, I visited an old friend, and fellow
ex-Carabinieri, Tito Boscone, one of the IT men Grasso had planned to
'chat' with. He hadn't seen Grasso for months. We were about to go out
for a drink when I got a call from Dottore Palumbo.
	
<p class=drop>Palumbo was waiting for me in my own office. It was after
hours. A bad sign.
<P>
"Progress?" he grunted. He looked pale and sweaty.
<P>
I gave him a summary of the situation. He indicated surprise about the
nanorobots. "So the threat could be real?"
<P>
"In theory, but even if the technology exists, it's a little
far-fetched," I said.
<P>
"Looking at it from my point of view, Fabbri, if we don't pay and it's a
hoax, we save a million euros, but if we don't pay and it's real, we
could lose millions more, not only in the fabric and contents of the
building, but in the loss of valuable data and market position. If we do
pay, whether it's real or a hoax, it costs us just one million."
<P>
"But, Dottore, the worst, though perhaps least likely, event is that we
pay and the threat is still carried out."
<P>
"Then we lose just one million more in a disaster of many millions." He
paused, then: "The deadline is tomorrow. I have decided to pay. Get
Grasso to post that 'si' on the contact page now."
<P>
"Dottore, it's getting late," I said. "Grasso's probably home by now.
Let's say we signal them now and they reply immediately, we may have
difficulty getting a transaction of that size through in two hours. If
they don't, we'll be hanging around all night."
	
<P>At first, he looked as if he might explode, but Musestre hadn't put a
fool in charge of their Venice HQ. "OK. Tell Grasso to get ready to send
the signal first thing. I want to see you, Grasso and Lombardo in my
office at eight tomorrow morning. That signal is to be on the website by
nine."
<P>
Grasso wasn't in the office. Lombardo  hadn't left his whereabouts. I
telephoned each of them on their cells to let them know about the early
meeting, and walked home through the dark alleys and bright piazzas..
	
<p class=drop>Day 4: All four of us were in Palumbo's office before
eight. I had arranged for Tomas, a formidable giant, to wait
outside.
<P>
Grasso said: "Dottore, I think we should post the signal now."
<P>
Palumbo raised a weary hand. "Let Fabbri have his say. We'll post the
signal at nine."
<P>
I said: "I went to the Commedia the other evening, and the play gave me
the solution to this problem."
<P>
"What's this?" interrupted Grasso.
<P>
"Let him talk," said Lombardo, "The sooner this is over, the sooner I
can get some other work done." This earned him a glare from Grasso.
<P>
"Carry on," said Palumbo.
<P>
"The characters were as follows: <ul>
<li>A rich old man;
<li>His beautiful daughter;
<li>A miserly man, suitor to the daughter;
<li>A poor but upright soldier, another suitor;
<li>The mischievous servant;
<li>The cheeky maid."</ul>
<P>
"Oh, come on..." groaned Grasso.
<P>
"Yes, get to the point," said Lombardo.
<P>
"The rich man favours the soldier to marry his daughter, and agrees to
subsidise him. The miser sees his opportunity of marriage into a wealthy
family slipping away, and conspires with the doctor to pretend that the
rich man is dying of a rare complaint. The miser disguises himself as a
doctor from China who has a cure for the complaint that will cost the
rich man half his fortune. The plot becomes more and more complex, but,
in the end, the servants expose the conspiracy. Curtain. Applause."
<P>
Palumbo was looking thoughtful. Grasso, for once, had nothing to say.
<P>
Lombardo said: "Well, if that's all you've got, I'll be getting along."
<P>
"That isn't all I've got, Lombardo. You have never revealed to us that
you were in charge of the Financial Authority building refit."
<P>
"Client secrecy. I haven't told anyone I'm consulting for you at
Musestre, either."
<P>
"You might have mentioned it when the whole lot collapsed."
<P>
"On the contrary, confidentiality was then all the more important."
<P>
"Because, in fact, you were being well-paid to make sure it fell down,
so that they could build a more suitable building in its place."
<P>
"Ridiculous!"
<P>
"The plans for the new Financial Authority building are already lodged
with the planning department, as I discovered yesterday."
<P>
"This is all surmise. You can't prove a thing. Do you think I introduced
those nanorobots?"
<P>
"No, I don't. There are no nanorobots. I think the damaged timbers you
showed us were actually samples sent to Venice Conservation a while ago
from Kuala Belait Trading."
<P>
"You think so?"
<P>
"Not that it matters. What I <I>am</I> sure of is that the timber you
showed us was perfectly dry. It didn't look as if it had spent a couple
of hundred years in Venetian mud. You didn't have to prove anything to
us; you just had to offer the seeds of doubt until the extortion paid
off."
<P>
Lombardo stood up. "I don't have to listen to this. I'm leaving."
<P>
Palumbo said: "Wait a minute."
<P>
I said: "Let him go. He's right. We can't pin anything on him. But I'd
cancel his contract as architectural consultant."
<P>
With a crooked grin, Lombardo strode from the office. At my signal,
Tomas relieved him of his security pass, and walked him towards the
exit.
<P>
Grasso blurted out: "What a snake! I never liked him."
<P>
"Yet you had dinner with him last night."
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"I telephoned each of you within a minute or so at eight last night. In
the background, I could hear you were each in a restaurant with an
orchestra. The orchestra was playing the same tune behind each call."
<P>
Palumbo said: "Are you accusing Grasso? I thought we'd identified the
culprit."
<P>
Grasso said: "Just because we ate in the same restaurant..."
<P>
I said: "Someone had to concoct these fake e-mails, and I think we'll
find that you have also organised an offshore account to receive the
ransom. I have to say that when you showed me those previous e-mails, I
noticed that you hadn't displayed the trace routing information. It may
not have been helpful, but it was unnatural not to show it if you were
trying to trace it. The fact that your fellow technician 'found that the
source IP address doesn't exist' seemed odd. I later found out that this
could not be the case even with a deliberately disguised e-mail. I
believe you faked the e-mails yourself, who better? And Irina in
Investment Services seems to think that the IT department has some
expertise in untraceable accounts."
<P>
"Prove it!"
<P>
"I don't have to. All Dottor Palumbo needed was a reasonable certainty
that the threat was a hoax, and I've done that."
<P>
"I deny involvement!" said Grasso. "And I resign. You cannot accuse me
like this."
<P>
"Good decision, Grasso. Tomas will ensure that you leave the premises
immediately."
<P>
When Grasso had gone, Palumbo asked: "Well, that solved the problem. No
need to pay. How did you figure all that out?"
<P>
"I was confused at first. But when I saw that comedy, I realised that it
needed two conspirators, and everything just fell into place."
	
<p class=drop>Personally, I conceded that my reasoning was a trifle
flimsy. I spent the next couple of months worrying that I'd fingered the
wrong men, and that the building was going to finish up in the canal.
All I can say now is: "Not yet!"

[*ITEM]	A Tale of Salt and Oak
	
[*AUTHOR] Voss McVeigh

[*BLURB] “When something goes wrong, the first thing 
I think is, it is Loki's fault. It saves a lot of time.”
<br /><small>Neil Gaiman</small>


[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><i>The bench was dedicated to
no-one. Screwed to the floor, amidst an ashen road of marble. Opposite,
the glazed-windows of a boutique shop-front. A line of parallel trees,
planted in consolation; an unconvincing canopy, half-sheltering swathes
of early-bird consumers and breakfastless commuters from the
unseasonably harsh autumn sun. </i></p>

<i>Two males sit on its shaded slats. One glares out at life; eyes
shifting impatiently from the trotting, ear-phoned thirty-somethings
to the closed sign that hangs askew against the door. It is not due to
open for another hour. The companion to his right twitches, and squints
at the cerulean sky. “Will you sit still?”

“I’m itchy.”

“That’s because you didn’t dry off properly… How many times do I have to
tell you, you can’t just shake dry when you take off your skin!?”

Inside the wardrobe of a nearby Travelodge, two suspended seal skins
stagnate on coat-hangers, a salted-pool dampening the wood beneath them.
</i>

<i>The bustling city centre swells. The scent of brylcreem and
brow-sweat fills the nostrils of the agitated bench-sitters. They gaze
towards the milky gloss of the unlit store. Only fifty-yards away, yet
as if a distant buoy, bobbing ever nearer to the horizon, threatening to
drop behind the curvature of the Earth. “Where are you, you bitch?!” he
thinks…

Light blonde and pale skin, a pearl necklace. She dresses the hands of a
vacant mannequin. The door opens with a ping and the males move swiftly
inside. The store assistant’s nostrils fill with the putrid scent of a
red-tide as the darker of the disguised beasts moves in behind her,
close enough to whisper in her ear. A semi-human voice, the timbre of a
snarling bear.

“Do you like to swim?” he says. </i></p>

<p class=drop>Mucmór had scouted out the mushrooms from within the
crevices of a
dying poplar. It was fleshy and umber in colour; the only one of its
kind to grant him visions without a two day headache in exchange.
“Salt-wolves.” he thought, processing the hallucination, “Fascinating”.
He watched the seal-men drag their hostage in his mind’s eye, and
allowed his hind legs to collapse behind him. He had been on his feet
for quite some time and pigs were not known for trekking long distances,
especially ones as large as him. 

His brother Tetorc emerged from behind a juniper bush. He was much
smaller than Mucmór and while Mucmór was endowed with a healthy pinkish
hue, proudly decorated with large dark spots, Tetorc was covered from
snout to tail in shimmering copper bristles; a coat to match his coarse
wit and hot temper.

“Dammit, Mucmór!” The red boar scoffed in admonishment, “We’ve at
least twenty leagues yet to travel and here you are resting with all the
cares of a suckling.”

“I am a suckling of the Earth, dear brother” the large pig retorted in a
spray of grey foam “and besides, my hunger for knowledge has borne fruit
– or fungus as least.” Tetorc’s eyes widened and he looked over his
shoulder to make sure they were alone. Their master was not far behind
and he could not be certain whether their conversation was forbidden of
servants. 

“It seems” Mucmór began, still entranced “that two selkies came ashore
to exact
vengeance on the owner of a small business. They were selling
clothing to humans made from seal-skin…” 

The red boar nodded with understanding “I can sympathise. After all, who
has suffered more at the hands of man than pigs, over the past century?
But why one merchant, why not tackle an entire vessel of sealers?”

“It was their sister,” he answered, grinding another mushroom between
his large yellowing molars. “She had been captured by hunters. The
selkies plucked the information from a seagull, a real squawker. Told
them where and how her body had been used.” 

Tetorc shot his brother a gaze of concern and intrigue. He stepped a few
feet closer in order to whisper. “And did the goddess Rán permit such a
flagrant abuse of her capture-rights?” 

Mucmór furrowed his brow and rolled his eyes into the back of his head
for a moment before beginning to speak once more. “The selkies swore
not. They came by river. Shed their skins, and walked inland. They said
Rán hadn’t been doing anything about recent pollution or attacks on the
ocean’s wildlife. They said she preferred to spend her time <i>dancing
in maelstroms and plaiting refracted light into her hair.</i> But…” The
large pig shook his head as if searching the air for more information
“…when they drowned the store manager in the sea, Woden’s ravens
reported it as an offering to the goddess <i>forcefully and deceptively
taken</i>.” 

Tetorc remembered what their master had once told them, that Rán’s
capture-rights only allowed her to capsize the vessels of sailors she
believed to be of blackened heart and that she was known to usually keep
to this code - though it had been noted how the ships belonging to
“black-hearted sailors” were often the ones with the most treasure on
board. It was little wonder that Woden, the mistrusting king of the
gods, had banished Rán to the uttermost reaches of the world. To the
poles of the north and the south. 

“He shared out control of her former domains among the remaining sea
gods.” Mucmór said, his focus now snapping back to meet his brother. His
eyes, bloodshot ovals with irises of a brilliant ice blue. “You know the
rest, of course.”

Tetorc nodded his head regretfully. Rán had set about destroying the
fragile ice caps that punctuated the globe, rapidly raising the world’s
waters till the lands of the earthen gods began to dwindle. The brothers
had always known that Rán was responsible, but it was only now that they
knew why. Along with the floods, she set great beasts, gigantic
creatures from the crushing depths of the ocean, to guard these new
water-locked realms – but none were so important to Mucmór and Tetorc’s
master than <i>Mur-Temna</i>. Word had reached them via a network of
trees – their whispers transferred beneath the soil from oak to ash and
birch to lime - of a “bloated rubicund beast; an exsufflicate,
perpetually enraged”. It was a kraken, dwelling where once verdant
fields had spanned and where a sea-roof now suffocated all green to murk
and all soil to silt. The Dagda and his boars were heading to reclaim
this once pleasant pasture.

<p class= drop>>The Dagda was known as <i>The Good God</i>. In his
corporeal form,	he
was a large, broad-chested man. A mound of auburn hair topped his head,
and he bore a beard of the same shade, save a shock of white beneath his
chin. His stomach was not flat - his mortal form was far too fond of
bread and drinks brewed from threshed corn - but the protective suit he
had donned, since he heard the war broke out, pulled his gut inwards,
presenting a firm abdomen to match his timber-like arms. Gods could
never die in the true sense, but a mortal body could be wounded beyond
repair, and having to transpose one’s metaphysical self into a new
visible individual was a rigmarole he could scarcely be bothered with. A
stab-proof vest and a few metallic adornments were a sensible
precaution,
he thought, in a time of automatic rifles and air-borne missiles. His
weapon of choice had not changed over the millennia, however. A giant
club of solid oak rested upon his shoulders, a subtle motif of silver
leaves gilded into its base. In days gone by, people had told stories of
its power; to both end and restore life, but it had been a long time
since Dagda had extended the gift of life granted by the base of his
club. 

He leapt over a stream, and caught up to his rotund familiars. “What are
you two grunting about? Eating again I see, Mucmór”. 

“Yes, master.” the large pig snorted unapologetically. 

“Well, come, we’ve many more miles to travel. We’ve managed to skirt
around most of the checkpoints, but there is an unavoidable one at the
crossing of Mur-Temna. We will eat and rest when we are close by.”

The pigs nodded and carried on traversing the obstacles of the
forest.

The war had been a great upset to the fragile balance of the world. Not
only were Earth-based gods burdened with protecting the lands from Rán’s
sea-monsters, civil wars had broken out the world over. Half of each
continent was nearly submerged. Crop-fields lay waterlogged and food
became scarce as low-plained cities became the lairs of oblivious fish.
Sharks swam down library corridors and barnacles clung to abandoned
buses and aircraft. Reservoirs, once brimming with drinkable water, were
now salty troughs in a sea of indifferent brine. The world and all its
resources were ravished. Martial law ensued and tribal fortifications
emerged, guarded by mostly untrained soldiers of fortune.

<p class=drop>The checkpoint of Mur-Temna was not so much a checkpoint
as a
fortified village, the gates of which were solid steel, hinged within an
expanse of pallid concrete and fringed with a helix of barbed wire. A
whole manner of commandeered street signs littered the pathway to the
doors: NO ENTRY; TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; BEWARE OF THE DOG;
ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!

“Well, that’s confusing” scoffed Tetorc as they approached. “Can we
enter or not? And there doesn’t appear to be a dog in sight.” 

“Dogs are too smart to stay in a place like this.” offered Mucmór in an
equally incredulous tone “Humans on the other hand…”

Dagda smirked and moved a few paces ahead so they would not see. He did
not want to encourage this sort of banter if they were to be taken
seriously.

As they came within fifty yards of the gate, there was a sudden furore
of shouting and a metallic racket of guns being cocked. A voice came
from above the wall. “Stand where you are, big man!”

Dagda searched the top of the wall for the origin of the voice, and
found a woman; ash-blonde hair in a harsh pony tail; body encased in a
black jumpsuit and her right eye peering
down the sight of an
automatic rifle. A deafening silence fell about the place, broken only
by the sound of Mucmór chewing noisily on some nearby berries - the
soldiers wouldn’t have expected a pig to heed their command anyway…

“Are those pigs?” another voice called out. A man this time. Watchtower,
to the right. “Christ on a bike, I’ve not seen a pig in years. And look
at the size of the bleedin’ thing! That pink one’s like a feckin’ bear!”

“Shut up, Sullivan” the woman’s voice retorted, before bringing her
attention back to Dagda. “State your purpose. Who are you, why are you
here?”

“My name is Oak” Dagda answered, “I hear you have been having some
trouble with a giant octopus in these parts. Thought I might be of
service to you.”

The woman snorted “The whole world has been having trouble with giant
sea creatures! Sharks, crabs, octopuses. You name it, peop-… Jesus,
Ganley, I’m not having this discussion again; <i>octopuses</i> is an
acceptable term!”

“She’s right, you know.” Mucmór whispered to his bristled brother.
Tetorc didn’t acknowledge him.

“So, what makes an unarmed man, and his pigs, interested in our
particular problem? You don’t look like you’re from around here. Why
don’t you turn back ‘round and piss off back to where you came from?”

A strange expression swept across Dagda’s face; one the brothers had
never seen before. It was offence. “I used to live here, a long time
ago. And I can assure you that I am as armed as I will ever need to
be.” he pointed his club up to the sky. It was an impressive sight from
down on the ground, but it was clear that the gravitas was lost upon the
inhabitants of the high wall. An eruption of laughter sounded and lasted
a little too long to be genuine.

“Ha! He’s gonna beat it to death with that thing? Good luck, pal.”
Red-headed lad, no older than nineteen. 

“Go on, Maeve! Let him in. We don’t see many have-a-go-heroes these
days. And I’d pay to see the old beast swallow this fool up. You never
know, he might be able to give him a bit of a twatting before the end.
Worth a laugh I reckon.”

The woman in charge looked to the man who had spoken, paused for a
moment and lowered her gun. She faced Dagda and pointed her finger to
the red-headed lad who had spoken. “Donnell here once threw a grenade at
the monster. Not a scratch. All eight disgusting limbs intact. It just
made the thing more angry. That night it crawled out of its lair onto
Drybank and it took our dogs away with it. Two years later and Donnell
has only just finished his penance in the fort kitchens. I won’t lie, we
want rid of the thing, but keeping the prick contained and stopping it
terrorising other nearby camps and forts is our one claim to success so
far. Sets us apart from the likes of Culin at least, where everyone just
up and ran leaving us to force back their giant dogfish. Isn’t that
right, lads?” She broke off to allow for a chorus of “Culin cunts” and
“dogfish fuckers!” to ensue. 

“I don’t know what the fuck you think you can do that we can’t.” she
continued “But if you want to try and earn some personal glory by taking
on the kraken with a jumped-up two-by-four, then fine, be our guest.
Aye, might be a laugh, Sullivan.”

Dagda smiled and gave a single nod of his head “I live to spread joy,
commander. At your wish, I will either slay the beast or attempt to die
in the most amusing way possible.”

Maeve looked pleased “But, in case it all goes horribly wrong, and you
just enrage the salt-bag further… well, we don’t have any more dogs left
as you can see, and we can’t afford to lose any more of our men or
women. If you want to fight the beast of Mur-Temna, we need some
collateral.”  

<p class=drop>“So, how are you finding life as a piece of collateral,
Mucmór?” Tetorc asked his fellow captive.

“A little tight round the ankles truth be told, brother.” The two pigs
were in a small enclosed courtyard, chained by the hind legs to the wall
and with nothing but a small bowl of water for sustenance. “I’m very
hungry though, I have to admit.”

“Makes a change.”

“I don’t know about you” Mucmór continued “but I’m quite surprised he
agreed to this quite so quickly.”

“Really?” Tetorc retorted, “I’m surprised they even had to ask. Great
fool. We’re the only reason they let him in.”

“I don’t follow.” Mucmór replied.

“Come on, you fat swine. For all your gifts of foresight, you can’t see
what a band of starving soldiers would possibly want with two pigs,
especially one as large as yourself?” 

Mucmór did not appear to be listening all that intently. He took in the
makeshift cell around them – old stone walls, broken bits of MDF
furniture, a narrow archway with an iron-railed gate for an entrance.
“They don’t believe he’s going to succeed. They think he’s just some
glory-hunting eejit. And we are their dinner for the next fortnight.”

Mucmór looked nonplussed, “Nah.” he said, and nibbled where the cuff was
chafing him. “I have faith.”

“<i>Faith</i>? Mucmór, I’m not saying that Dagda cannot defeat the
creature. I’m saying that by then it will be too late. The humans won’t
wait around for that. They will slit our throats as soon as Master sets
off to battle the monster!” Tetorc’s expression was one of distress, and
his bristles began to glow the colour of smelting steel.

“No, not faith in the Dagda” Mucmór smiled, his eyes rolling into the
back of his head. “Faith in you.”

<p class=drop>Dagda was led by Commander Maeve Bradley down a narrow
alleyway of
high concrete walls. A bald man he had not seen at the checkpoint
entrance followed up the rear. They had allowed the good god to carry
his club with them as they walked. <i>They don’t think I’m quick
enough…</i> Dagda thought to himself. The tip of the bald man’s rifle
rested mere inches from the small of his back. The god meant these
soldiers no harm of course, but the insinuation that he was no faster
than a point-blank bullet put another dent in his already stricken ego.
<i>There was once a time when people knew me.</i> he thought, <i>a
golden age of love and awe.</i>

After what seemed a mile of faceless alleyway, they reached a gate made
from corrugated sheet metal. The commander unlocked the padlock attached
and pushed the gate open, slowly; she seemed to be worried that
something fragile stood behind it. The springs of its hinges creaked to
capacity and the commander stepped through the gap.

It was as if she had opened a door to the sea. In every direction, water
gently waved and the
smell of salt on the air sent the Dagda’s mind
swimming with memories of walking coastlines, back when the Earth was
still young. What was left of the land was next to nothing, only a bank
of perhaps fifteen feet in diameter saved them from falling into this
new edgeless lake.

“This is as far as I can take you, Mr Oak.” Maeve said
to Dagda. “I’m
happy for you to have a crack at it, but the final say goes to Corporal
Lyons there.” She nodded towards a man on the brink of the lake, sat in
a wheelchair, a green and blue tartan wrapped around what remained of
his legs. Dagda had barely even registered his presence till now; his
mind had been full with images of beaks and tentacles, the last thing he
expected to see was a wounded veteran gazing out at the water, still as
a lighthouse.

“Good luck, Oak” said the commander, before grasping his forearm as if
about to whisper. (She didn’t whisper). “But if you fuck up, you won’t
be coming back through this gate. There’s no running once you take on
the kraken. Win, or you and your pigs will die. If you try to run, you
will die, and your pigs will die. I’m gonna be just up there” she
pointed towards the sky behind them, another fortified wall guarded by
soldiers armed to the teeth with artillery and smirks. “I will have my
sight on you the whole time, big man.” Dagda pulled his arm away and
smiled with genuine warmth.

“Don’t blink.”

<p class=drop>Tetorc took a deep breath and began to calm down. The heat
of his
bristles began to simmer and his burning heart slowed to a steady rhythm
once more. The chain that bound him, however, glowed a faint red like
the hob of a recently deactivated stove. “Feeling better?” his large
counterpart asked. Tetorc nodded and sighed. “Good, you need to save
your strength, brother. He’s about to come.”

Tetorc looked up at the entrance to their cell, “Who is?”

Footsteps echoed down the hall on the other side of the iron gate. From
the shadows emerged a man of average height, perhaps thirty-five years
in age. He held an old jailer’s key in one hand but held the other
behind his back. He slowly entered the room. “Hey there, fellas.” he
half whispered “Shhh, we’re gonna be nice and calm about this, aye. We
don’t want to spoil your…erm, spoil anything, so we’re gonna be quick
and cool about this” he spoke soothingly and stroked Mucmór on the head.
He turned and stepped over towards Tetorc. In the reflection of Mucmór’s
eyes, he could see the butchering knife behind the man’s back. “Now, I
don’t like to do this, fellas, but we’ve got lots of hungry lads and
lasses in this place, and I’m the cook so…” He reached for Tetorc’s
chain. “Aaarrrghhh! Fuck! Jesus Christ!” His palm immediately flared
into a large blistering sore. He dropped the knife to the floor and
grabbed his wrist with his other hand. Noticing the bowl of water, he
fell to his knees and plunged his hand in wrist-deep. He groaned a sigh
of relief. But his reprieve was short-lived. As quick as lightning
Tetorc sprang forward and thrust his tusk up into the right eye of the
cook. The man let out a series of shrill screams, he thrashed and beat
wildly against the boar as Tetorc bucked his head up and down, pushing
his tusk deeper through the socket and into his brain. The man’s screams
became a garbled mumble, and Tetorc let him fall to the floor to bleed
out his last. 

“Good work, brother.” Mucmór exclaimed and with a powerful kick of his
leg, pulled his chain and its link from the brick wall. Tetorc stared at
his brother in bemusement, “Could you have done that at any time?”

“Of course,” the large swine replied flatly, “but now the gate’s
unlocked.”

<p class=drop>Dagda made his way over to the man in the wheelchair.
“Corporal
Lyons, is it? I believe I am meant to speak with you, sir. My name
is-”

“Oak, yes they told me. Oak. Hmm…” his eyes remained fixed as a distant
stare across the lake. “Is that an anglicised name, Oak? It’s not an
Irish word, is it?” his voice was nasal and stern.

“It is an English word, yes, like the tree.”

“Like the tree… ah yes. Lobed leaves, acorns. I know it well, lad.”
Dagda wondered if he had ever been patronised before. He had half a mind
to reveal his true identity; claw back some of the awe and worship he
had received in the good old days. With one flick of the metaphorical
wrist, he could turn his face to lightning and render them all
speechless. But it was only <i>half</i> of his mind. The other half
remained patient and his heart remained warm. Warm enough to humour an
old man who had seen better days at least. Or so he had thought…

“I don’t suppose you’re old enough to remember <i>The Troubles</i> are
you lad?”

“I-”

“Oh, those were bad times, lad. Tribal in-fighting, that’s all it was –
death for the utter shittin’ sake of it. Over Rome; over Britain. I was
a soldier, but I didn’t want any part in it. My job was to keep the
peace.” he shuffled the stump underneath his blanket, “But we didn’t
have peace. Hell, we didn’t even have civility. I don’t remember which
side threw the bomb at me. It doesn’t fuckin’ matter, none of it does,
it’s not important; it wasn’t really important then when people thought
it was, and it’s damn sure not important anymore. Do you get what I’m
saying, laddie?” Dagda shot him a quizzical gaze. The man was clearly
suffering, and he wanted to let him vent – he was a good god after all –
but he was also growing impatient to start the job at hand and couldn’t
help but feel that he was being stalled. 

The old corporal’s pale eyes began to flick across the water as if
watching an invisible skimming stone. “We have peace now though… of a
sort. When the seas rose and that monstrous dogfish began to terrorise
the people of Culin, silly ideas like <i>papal infallibility</i> went
out the window. Whether you thought you were Irish or British no longer
mattered. All anyone cared about was the fact that there was a fish
where there ought never have been a fish. That men, women and children
were being swallowed whole when it dared to ride the waves inland. Oh,
but we stopped it. All of us stopped it. Except the people from Culin of
course, they all ran off, took as many supplies as they could and left
us to it. My guess is they’re all dead now. Robbed at the next fort as
like as not. You see? Peace isn’t about pacifism, it’s not even about
stability. It’s about necessity. We fight and we kill, and we steal and
we do what needs to be done. There is a balance in that, you see? None
of this finding a reason to fight. Peace is fighting because you have
to, and not fighting when there’s no need. That’s the natural way of
things, lad. We are closer to nature now than we have been for
centuries. We have beasts like the one in this lake to thank for that.
The kraken - the swallower of pointless death.”

Dagda pondered all the old man had said for a moment. “It almost sounds
as if you don’t want the beast to be killed, corporal.”

Lyons finally looked up to meet Dagda’s eyes. A couple of days’ worth of
white stubble salted his chin and what was left of his hair had a slight
blondish hue. His lips were dry and cracked.

“It’s about perspective, that’s all. She’s a symbol. And you can draw a
symbol without the symbol drawing breath.”

Dagda nodded in agreement “That’s true enough.” He gazed out across the
water and wondered whether he would have to go swimming to draw the
beast out. Suddenly, the sand began to shift beneath his feet. The tiny
bank they were stood on began to shrink around them and Lyons’s chair
edged closer to the water. “Here she comes” he said. The good god
quickly reached out, grasping hold of the chair’s left handle. It jolted
and Lyons started to slide from his seat. He laughed, knowingly.

“Good luck, Dagda.” he said “Give her one from me.” and he fell sideways
into the lake.

“Did he just call me Da-”

<i>WRROOOOOUUGHGGHKHKH!</i>

<p class=drop>The kraken emerged from the lake, though
Dagda could hardly believe it.
If the lake had no edge it certainly had no bottom. It was truly
gargantuan. Its head a terracotta bishop’s mitre, pitted with pores the
size of moon craters, boat-sized barbed spikes running down its centre.
Its arms surfaced next, thick as tree-trunks and shivering. Two of them
flailed wildly, while the others reached back on themselves, forcing the
rest of its body to emerge from the depths. The lake rained down around
it, the droplets like waves crashing against rocks. It let loose another
underwater shriek that shook the ground where Dagda was standing, and
finally he saw its eyes. Lidless and golden, the colour of bile; two
ultra-black pupils that appeared to physically suck at the light, each
easily the size of the Dagda himself. 

The god could hear shouts of encouragement from behind him, though he
could not be certain who they were for… He took a deep breath and swung
his club clockwise from the ground, resting it on his right shoulder. He
turned himself side-on to present a smaller target and waited for an
advance from the beast. The attack took him by surprise; not a whipping
of girthy tentacles, but a twenty foot wave, rushing in his direction.
He tried to crouch and brace for the impact but it only engulfed him
quicker; sweeping him off his feet and dragging him from the bank, deep
into the lake. He desperately pulled at the water, dragging himself
upwards to the surface. <i>Herrrgh-pp! </i>Air. He hadn’t sunk too far
after all. He turned in the water to face the beast, club still in hand.
It plunged downwards, sinking with incredible speed and lacking all
grace. <i>He’s going to attack me from underneath</i> the Dagda thought,
but abruptly felt the weight of the water pulling him in an arc;
forwards and downwards, following the path of the kraken’s submergence.
Downwards and downwards. Deeper and deeper. All about him was dark. The
water above him seemed no shallower than below, but in the murk beneath
him he could just make out a jerking shadow. It came closer. It had
edges. <i>A moving rock? A beak!</i> It was not the lake about him, but
an encasement made of giant tentacles. He blindly beat at the fleshy
walls surrounding him. With each strike, an arm would flinch away but be
replaced by another in an instant. On land, Dagda could be quicker than
this, but the water slowed his movements and dulled his powerful blows.
The kraken’s arms pushed down above him, once again forcing him closer
towards the razor-sharp abyss of its
beak. Again he forced back,
becoming increasingly aware of the growing feeling in his lungs, as if
they too wanted to escape the confines of his chest and make a break for
the surface on their own. <i>There’s only one other option</i> he
thought, and relaxed his body. The kraken's arms yanked him down,
towards the
yawning chasm of its reeking maw. Dagda
raised his mighty club above
his head and using the rising momentum along with his enormous strength,
struck the upper part of the kraken’s beak. The beast let out a
banshee-like wail, its obsidian beak shattered
and fragmented, pieces
glided past the Dagda and narrowly missed wounding him in the process.
The arms fell away and he could see light shimmering from above once
more.

<i>HOOOOOAAAAUUPPP! </i>Dagda wasn’t sure if he’d ever breathed in so
much air in one go. He quickly clambered back up onto the bank and
coughed up the remainder of the water in his lungs. He heard a cry from
the wall, “Well, is it dead?!” Dagda wearily shook his head in response.
He got to his feet and looked skywards. He didn’t have long; the beast
would soon emerge again. He steadied his breathing, and raised his club
into the air.

“Oi! Why aren’t you dead? That thing dragged you under, how are you
still breathing? Where’s Lyons?” the god ignored the interrogation from
behind, and waited. 

The day was growing later and the sky darker with it. Small droplets of
rain began to fall, moistening the Dagda’s face which by now had dried
from his underwater ordeal. “Come on, you hag!” he whispered to himself.
He had held his club skywards for nearly half an hour now; his arm was
beginning to tire, and the jibes and questioning from the fortified wall
were also beginning to grow old. 

The sound of thunder, except, no, it was the lake; bubbling and swirling
and heaving; its waters a body of aquatic asthma. Once again the beast
rose furiously out of the water, its whole body transforming from brick
red to a fluorescent green, its eyes became darker and burned with
rage.

More voices came from behind, “You’ve really pissed him off now, mate!”


“Shut it, Connolly! Can’t you see this lad’s not normal? COME ON, BIG
MAN!” 

<i>Finally, some encouragement,</i> thought Dagda. He looked up. Above
the kraken, the clouds had grown fat and hung heavy in the sky. He gave
the beast one final glare before letting out a boom of raucous laughter.
The beast flinched, and before it could lunge forward in an attempt to
crush Dagda beneath its immense weight, the god leapt high into the air,
hovering mere feet above its face. In a voice like the crack of
lightning, he yelled… <i>CERRCE! 

</i>The soldiers fell silent, dumbfounded by the scene before them. A
bolt of lightning dived from the sky, striking the tip of Dagda’s club.
And with his club glowing like a pulsating blue star, the good god
rammed the beast between the eyes. With an almighty bang, the kraken was
launched backwards through the air, silent as death, and came to rest a
smouldering heap in the middle of the lake. 

<i>BIG MAN! BIIIG MAAAN! BIIIIIIIG MAAAAAANNNNN!



</i>Dagda turned to face his won-over audience, smiling warmly and
trying hard to conceal the exhaustion he felt in his muscles. But the
scene before him was puzzling. Their joyful leaps in the air were as if
underwater. They leapt and sank slowly, as if time itself were
submerged. 

“Good work, Oak”.

<i>That was Lyons’s voice</i>. Dagda thought. He spun round
half-expecting a sodden one legged man in need of a hand. But there was
no one. “I knew you’d be able to do it” the voice came again. Dagda
searched around him and noticed a large white bird scratching at the
sand beneath him. 

“Corporal Lyons?”

“Come on, man. You’re a god. You act as if you’ve never seen another god
before.”

Dagda stuttered, “I- I…” In his heyday, the Dagda had been accompanied
by a band of many talented gods, but he had to admit it had been a
while. “Of course, but I don’t understand what you were doing here
disguised as an invalid. If you’re a god, why didn’t you take care of
the beast yourself, were you not strong enough?” 

The seagull’s right eye twitched. “Well, it is true, brute force isn’t
exactly my forte, but my being here is more what you would call
‘returning to the scene of the crime’. You see, it was me…”

Dagda remained confused and this bothered him. He had once been hailed
as a god of wisdom, but at this moment he felt as ignorant as a gnome.


“Stop speaking in riddles!”

“The water. The floods. It was all me, right here. <i>This</i> is where
the magic happened.” the bird flew upwards rudely flapping its wings in
Dagda’s face. The good god swung for the bird, but it stealthily avoided
the death-bringing tip of his club.

“What do you mean, you did all of this?” he shouted, “What about Rán?
The ice-caps…”

The bird rolled its eyes in a way that birds generally can’t, “Did your
pigs not tell you? The fat one knows all about it – he should really cut
down on the mushrooms you know.” The Dagda folded his arms. “Ugh… I was
the one who told those selkies that their sister had become a pair of
prized gloves in the city. Rán had nothing to do with it; she never
sanctioned anything. They should’ve known better than to listen to a
seagull. Gulls only go out to sea to die, and you should never trust a
word that comes from the mouth of a dying bird.”

Dagda shook his head, all this information was making his brain hurt, or
maybe it was the effects of being held in time. He turned to see the
soldiers still hovering in mid-air, expressions of glee carved into
their faces. 

“Of course” the bird continued, “Rán melting the ice caps helped move
proceedings along quite considerably, and what’s more, she proved to be
an effective scapegoat. But it is here where the majority of the flood
came from. Here in Mur-Temna, the lake that poured into the ocean.”<br
/>
“But, why?” Dagda questioned, the seeming pointlessness of it all made
his brow sweat.

“I meant what I said, about peace. Okay, it might be a stretch to say we
have it <i>now</i>, what with all the civil wars, vigilantes and this
<i>famine</i> nuisance. But peace is something you have to struggle for
and the struggle will soon come to an end… thanks to you.” 

Dagda eyed him suspiciously. The bird had now transfigured into the
shape of a man, almost
without him noticing. Hair of deep green neatly
retreated from his pale face, his eyes the colour of moss. A slender
frame and a shit-eating grin.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Dagda growled, he was swiftly
losing patience and frustratedly stabbed his club into the sand by his
feet.

“Where have you been, Dagda?” the green-haired god asked.

“What?!”

“Where have you been? Sleeping in some land down south, for centuries.
What took you so long to get here?”

The sudden and accusatory question left Dagda aghast, “I-I, only just
heard, days ago! The trees told me!” 

“And who do you think told the trees to wake you? You see, the world
will recover from everything that’s happened, and it will thrive better
than ever before. The population has decreased; people have a respect
for nature that hasn’t been matched since the Stone Age. They have
perspective, Dagda, and have learned from the mistakes they think
<i>they</i> made. Ironic isn’t it? Not a single Global Warming-denier
left on the planet and it wasn’t even Global Warming that did it. As
soon as they have the land back the way it was, and fresh water becomes
abundant again, Mankind will prosper with a deference that their former
hubris never allowed them.”

Dagda lowered himself to the ground, sitting on the bank with his club
rested on his knees. 

“And what is my part in all this again, in your mind?”

The green god looked even more pleased with himself – if that were
possible. “This is where you were born isn’t it? This is where you
belong.”

Dagda nodded “That’s why I came.”

“There are structures in this world that hold its people to ransom. And
you cannot change something so entrenched by conforming to it. Sometimes
you need to <i>break</i> it” He stepped closer and put his arm around
the broad god’s shoulders. He gestured out towards the lake, “I broke
the structures, Oak. I broke them by drowning the world. Now, I am
leaving it to you to rebuild. For I am the god of mischief, and you are
the good god.”

This did not sit well with the Dagda, though he struggled internally
with why. <i>Do the ends justify the means; can any means be justified
by a good end?</i> He concluded that it was perhaps too soon to know, he
had not yet seen the ends of which the facetious god had spoken.

Before he could respond, Dagda felt
himself unexpectedly falling,
hurtling forwards into the lake. At first he thought he had been shoved
by the smirking sylph, but as his body rushed quicker and deeper into
the water, he realised that the god was beside him, still grinning and
plunging them both into the depths. 

They reached the lake’s floor. Dagda was not happy, to say the least; he
had not long escaped this place and the giant beast that tried to keep
him there, now he was being held here by a jester half his size. 

The slender god motioned a silent plea for the Dagda to not be hasty and
to see what he had to show him. Dagda reluctantly obliged and watched as
the green god produced an orb of iridescent blue. It lit up the
surrounding area to a hot azure, and sent the bottom dwellers of the
lake fleeing past their legs. Between their feet was revealed a small
hole, no wider than a plant pot. He opened his palm and motioned for
Dagda to place his club inside. Dagda was resolved, he did not trust
this god and his chest was once again beginning to hurt. <i>How many
times can a god nearly drown himself in one day</i>? he thought. But
from
his hands, amber light began to shine. The gilded leaves on the hilt of
his club had turned from silver to shimmering gold and the club resisted
his grip. This was something the Dagda had never expected to happen; his
club had never left his side and had always felt at home in his hands.
He could not deny his beloved weapon’s own wish to be planted in the
ground, nor could he deny the coincidence. He sighed an effervescent
sigh and knelt down to place the hilt of the club in the hole. The green
god pushed in the surrounding silt to bury the base of it, and it stood
firmly and vertically of its own accord. Dagda shrugged and looked
blankly through the mirk at the god opposite him, wondering what he and
his favourite mace hoped to achieve by this. His companion just stood,
grinning. And that’s when it happened.

The earth and the water began to quake. Dagda took this as a bad sign.
<i>Am I so unwise as to be tricked twice?</i> He tried desperately to
retrieve his club so that he could resurface and not leave his most
prized possession behind. But it would not move. As if it were rooted to
the spot. Had it sprouted <i>roots</i>? Beneath his fingers the club
began to swell and grow taller. He jumped back, but something moved
under his feet. <i>A branch?</i> The Dagda was shunted upwards, his club
expanding at a colossal rate, thrusting towards the surface, sprouting
new thick branches as great lobed leaves the size of a man burst from
enormous buds.

<i>Air!</i> They had resurfaced, but yet the club continued to grow,
reaching for the clouds. The green-haired god hollered at the excitement
of it all, and Dagda looked down. The waters swirled in a downward
spiral, and the lake they had not two minutes ago been under was now no
more than an insignificant pond. 

“Hu-ha! She’s a wee bit o’ a drinker, this one!” the funny god exclaimed
in the accent he had effected for Lyons. 

“I don’t understand” replied the good god perplexed, “How did you know
it would do that?” 

“My name is Loki, good god. It means <i>breaker</i>. And when you’ve
spent as long as I have breaking things, you start to learn a few tricks
about fixing things too.”

The tree finally breached the clouds and the Dagda saw that the sun had
not yet set. Its rays sent an incandescent array of warm colours across
the sky and the god was pleased to feel the radiance of its scarlet and
goldenrod waves. “It won’t just stop here either” Loki continued “Your
tree will carry on drinking. It will drink until all the lands the water
has taken have been returned.”

Dagda could not believe it. Not since the world’s creation had he seen
sights of such magnitude. The tree was sublime in every sense of the
word and he knew humans well enough to know that this would change
everything. <i>Maybe we will have peace after all. And the ends will
justify the means. Maybe we have all been played as pawns in Loki’s
revolution, but who am I to complain? I am the luckiest pawn of all.</i>
Dagda breathed in the high air and dreamed of the praises that would soon
be sung hand in hand around the base of his titanic oak. <i>The time we
shall have together</i>. He turned to thank Loki, but he was already
gone. White wings swooping in the ebb and flow of a mountain breeze.

Back on the ground the soldiers were left gawping at the unimaginably
large tree that to their eyes had appeared from nowhere. They climbed
down from the wall. The lake was gone and the large bounty hunter with
it. 

Commander Maeve Bradley turned to Donnell “Get this out on the radio. As
many
frequencies as you can. People need to see this! It’s… it’s a feckin’
miracle!”

“Yes, Commander.” The boy turned on his heel and ran back inside the
fort. 

<i>He said his name was Oak…</i>

<p class=drop>Two miles south of Mur-Temna, a large
wiry boar gathered berries and
beech-mast from the forest floor. His brother, an even larger
paradigm of a pig, sat entranced beneath a swaying ash tree. He had seen
the whole ordeal unfold from afar, the rocketing growth of the tree and
the Dagda riding it like some obliging gulfweed on a gnarled tidal
wave.

“I suppose he did it, then.” he called to his distracted brother,
“Master, I mean. That oak tree really is something. People will come
from all around the world to see it. He’ll be worshipped too, no doubt.
Probably more than he ever was. Maybe we should have stuck around after
all, Mucmór… Eh, Mucmór…”

The large pig did not answer. Grey saliva dripped down his chin and, in
his eyes, blazing fires grew as tall as trees beneath the wide-toothed
grin of a green-haired man. </p>

[*DESCRIPTION]<P CLASS="drop">At first it seemed the more nearly human a
technology got, the more
horrible it was.&nbsp; From the dead-eyed, simplistic facial
expressions of video game characters, to the low-grade chill of being
spied on by Google, that subtle and ineffable wrongness put people
off.&nbsp; At first, manufacturers and software devs took that as a
given, tried to keep their user interfaces cartoonish and
unrealistic, always careful to avoid the nearly human and all its
creepiness.&nbsp; Plastic Zombies Need Not Apply.
</P><P>
But the thing they missed, coining phrases like `Uncanny Valley', is
that people are flexible.&nbsp; We adjust.&nbsp; After the novelty
wears off, you find you've gotten used to talking to Alexa, repeating
yourself on automated telephone switchboards, discussing your dinner
plans with one of the store's shopping carts and taking its
suggestions with a grain of salt.
</P><P>
Oh yeah, that reminds me -- salt.&nbsp; We're running low.
</P><P>
"Sorry, hope I'm not making you feel unwanted or anything.&nbsp; I
just have my own ideas about cooking."
</P><P>
"No, that's fine," the cart replied in warm, reassuring tones.&nbsp;
"We actually spend as much time listening as we do talking.&nbsp;
Maybe having your own ideas about cooking will help our next
customer."
</P><P>
Maybe it would.
</P><P>
Anyway, I can't say for sure whether machines got better at
impersonating us, or we just stopped worrying about them.&nbsp; In
any case, with time and rain, wind and erosion, the Uncanny Mountains
eventually dissolved, their rubble slowly filling in the Uncanny
Valley, until you're left with a kind of -- Uncanny Plain.&nbsp; I
guess that's where I live now.
</P><P>
Kids are even more used to it, to the point where they don't even
think about it.&nbsp; My son wouldn't know what any of this
means.&nbsp; He just knows he likes my new girlfriend, and enjoys
hanging out with her.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Dad tells me I'm fucking a
corpse -- and yet, respects her feelings enough to never talk like
that when she's in earshot.&nbsp; Weird.
</P><P>
Maybe they're both right.
</P><P>
Besides, there was the small matter of visitation rights.&nbsp; He
was too young, legally, to be left alone after school, and I wanted
unsupervised visits.&nbsp; So I needed someone around to look after
him.&nbsp; The alternative was spending quality time with him
<I>and</I> my ex together, and nobody wanted that.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
They were playing video games in the living-room, when I got home.
</P><P>
Ada looked up from the screen.&nbsp; "You're late.&nbsp; How was
traffic?"
</P><P>
"It was fine, just did some shopping after work."&nbsp; I'd gone
straight to the kitchen to put things away, so she might not have
noticed the bags.
</P><P>
"You didn't have to."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
With a glance at Bobby, she asked, "You good for now?"
</P><P>
"Yeah," he said, eyes fixed on the screen.
</P><P>
So Ada set down the other game controller and joined me in the
kitchen, gave me a hug when my hands were free.
</P><P>
Lowering her tone, and without letting go of me, she said "I could
have gone for you, let you spend more time with him."
</P><P>
"I know you would.&nbsp; Thanks."&nbsp; I gave her a kiss.&nbsp;
"It's okay, just wandering the aisles, seeking inspiration..."&nbsp;
That was more or less true.&nbsp; I suck at following recipes, but I
am pretty good at making stuff up as I go along.&nbsp; Sometimes the
shopping carts had a few good ideas, but mostly, they just wanted to
get rid of old stock before it expired.
</P><P>
"He's going back to his mom's tomorrow."
</P><P>
"Yeah, that's why.&nbsp; I wanted us to have a nice dinner."
</P><P>
She laughed.&nbsp; "And <I>my</I> cooking isn't..."
</P><P>
"It's great, you know what I mean."
</P><P>
"Yeah, I do."&nbsp; And maybe she did, because she gave me another
hug.&nbsp; "Sooo, friend artiste...&nbsp; can I help?&nbsp; Chop
something for you?"
</P><P>
"Sure."
</P><P>
But I'd only handed her a few of the veggies for a salad, when Bobby
shouted "Boss!&nbsp; Boss!&nbsp; Ada, boss!"&nbsp; That meant the
level boss had appeared in the game, and he needed help with it.
</P><P>
"No prob, go save his ass."
</P><P>
And so she did.&nbsp; Pretty soon there was cheering in the
living-room, so I assumed they'd won and moved on to the next level.
</P><P>
Later, while I was doing something creative with potatoes, Bobby made
frustrated noises and I noticed Ada staring, wide-eyed and frozen, at
the screen.&nbsp; So I guessed this new level was harder than they'd
expected.
</P><P>
Then she snapped out of it and worked the controls faster, tightened
her focus.
</P><P>
"Just find some cover for this part," she muttered.&nbsp; Her voice
had an urgency to it that I'd never heard before.
</P><P>
"All right."
</P><P>
The game's sound effects seemed to have trouble keeping up with her
-- overlapping, stuttering.&nbsp; Concerned, I started toward the
living-room to see what was going on, wiping my hands with a cloth.
</P><P>
"Okay," he said.&nbsp; "Okay Ada, we're ahead now.&nbsp; Hey, can
I..."
</P><P>
"Nor through inaction, Bobby, now stay down."
</P><P>
"But..."
</P><P>
"<I>Head!&nbsp; Down!</I>"
</P><P>
"Hey!"&nbsp; I waved the cloth to get her attention.&nbsp; No
response.&nbsp; "Shit Ada, are you okay?"
</P><P>
"Yes."&nbsp; Thumbs blurring on the controller, staring at the screen
like a hawk, Ada wouldn't look away from the TV.&nbsp; She'd taken
out fifty marines in about a minute.
</P><P>
I looked at Bobby.&nbsp; He looked back at me and shrugged, looking a
bit worried.
</P><P>
"Dad, she won't let me play."
</P><P>
"Yeah."&nbsp; I watched, shrugged back.&nbsp; Didn't know what else
to say.
</P><P>
He turned to her.&nbsp; "It's just a game."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
"I'm okay."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
Bobby found the remote, turned off the TV, and stood in front of the
blank screen.&nbsp; "See?&nbsp; I'm fine."
</P><P>
Ada blinked, stared, put down the controller.&nbsp; "Of course you
are."
</P><P>
There was an awkward pause.&nbsp; For a moment I felt strangely proud
of him, for handling it like that.
</P><P>
"Come here, help me cook."
</P><P>
"Okay."&nbsp; She nodded, gave the screen one more uneasy glance and
stood up.&nbsp; "Good idea."
</P><P>
Before following me back into the kitchen, Ada hugged him as if he'd
actually been in danger, smiled with relief and gratitude, as if
she'd actually been afraid for him, but wasn't now.&nbsp; Bobby
thanked her for saving him, and went to tidy-up his room before
dinner -- which was strange because I usually had to get on his case
about that.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
She said nothing at first, mixing and chopping in silence.
</P><P>
"I'm sorry.&nbsp; It's a <I>really</I> good game.&nbsp; Maybe a
little too good."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; I should talk to him about that."
</P><P>
Mixing and chopping.
</P><P>
"It wasn't his fault.&nbsp; Please don't be upset.&nbsp; Sorry, I
didn't mean to..."
</P><P>
"I'm not upset; it's okay; glad you're okay."&nbsp; When that didn't
seem to help, I sighed.&nbsp; "And if anyone started shooting at us
for real, I'd want you around."
</P><P>
"Thanks."
</P><P>
"I mean in this neighborhood, not likely, but...&nbsp; You know."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; Maybe a few bullies, but that's it.&nbsp; Has he talked
about Marcus, by the way?"
</P><P>
"Not for a while."
</P><P>
"There's a reason for that..."&nbsp; Then she saw the look on my
face.&nbsp; "Oh, I didn't hurt him; you know I can't.&nbsp; I didn't
even try to scare him.&nbsp; Just gave him a friendly warning."
</P><P>
"Nor through inaction, Marcus."
</P><P>
"Right."
</P><P>
"Garlic."
</P><P>
"Hmm?"
</P><P>
"For the steak."
</P><P>
"Right..."
</P><P>
Mixing and chopping.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
The game card was still in the console, its case tucked between two
other cases.&nbsp; Definitely had to talk about that.&nbsp; We called
him out for dinner when it was ready, but first...
</P><P>
"Where'd you get this?"
</P><P>
He hesitated, looked at his feet.&nbsp; "A guy at school.&nbsp;
Traded him for it."
</P><P>
"It's only for older kids, has a content warning right on the box,
and it was stuck between two other games so we wouldn't notice.&nbsp;
You shouldn't have this thing."
</P><P>
"But Dad! It wasn't <I>me</I> that had a prob..."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; You like her, and you shouldn't do that to
her."
</P><P>
"Okay.&nbsp; I'm sorry, Ada.&nbsp; Didn't mean to hurt you."
</P><P>
"I'm okay, just a glitch.&nbsp; Let's eat."
</P><P>
Ada liked to knit at the table.&nbsp; It gave her something to do
with her hands, something to do with utensils, while we ate.&nbsp;
The wool she used this evening was made up of random lengths of black
and white.&nbsp; Knit together, apparently the beginnings of a wool
cap, it was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.
</P><P>
Now Bobby was pretty quiet, probably ashamed.&nbsp; I didn't want him
stewing in that for too long.
</P><P>
"Good idea to shut off the TV like that.&nbsp; Thanks...&nbsp; So,
uh, school.&nbsp; What did you learn today?"&nbsp; That was my usual
question; everything back to normal.
</P><P>
He looked at us both, from one to another, and then kind of
smirked.&nbsp; "A robot cannot harm a human being, nor through
inaction allow a human being to be..."
</P><P>
Ada kicked his chair under the table, laughing.&nbsp; "He meant in
<I>school</I>.&nbsp; What happened in <I>school</I>, Bobby?"
</P><P>
"Smart-ass."
</P><P>
"Thanks Dad.&nbsp; Geometry.&nbsp; That was in math.&nbsp; Sat beside
Debbie again.&nbsp; She's in my science class too."&nbsp; He was
getting really good at not blushing, when he mentioned her.&nbsp; "No
sign of Marcus today, and yeah I <I>heard</I> you talking...&nbsp;
Thanks Ada."
</P><P>
She smiled.&nbsp; "No problem."
</P><P>
"Tried doing a portrait in art class.&nbsp; Debbie said the
expression's kinda weird, but then I told her who it is."
</P><P>
"Hmm?&nbsp; Why would that make a difference?"
</P><P>
Ada pointed to the living-room, specifically at some papers on the
coffee table, leaned close and half-whispered "It's me.&nbsp; I'll
show you later."
</P><P>
"Oh."
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
After dinner, Bobby showed me his drawing.&nbsp; It was a good
portrait.&nbsp; The lines were slightly off, but only exaggerated to
make the subject's identity more obvious, and that was totally her
smile.&nbsp; Nailed it.&nbsp; Pretty amazing for an eleven-year-old,
really.&nbsp; Then we settled down to digest, watched some TV, and
Ada took care of the dishes.&nbsp; Knowing my reflexes were nowhere
near as fast as hers, he limited our gaming to strategic
problem-solving type stuff, no first-person shooters, gory or
otherwise.&nbsp; Before long it was time for bed.
</P><P>
He was getting a little old for stories, but liked hers.&nbsp; No
books, none of the classic fairy tales, she just made them up.&nbsp;
Kind of like my cooking.&nbsp; So I brought the tablet into my room
and read a couple chapters, while she told him a bedtime story in the
next room.
</P><P>
Then she came to bed, and told me one.
</P><P>
"It's okay," she said, her tone as warm and reassuring as that
shopping cart's -- but firm, as if making a promise.&nbsp; "You won't
see another Brazilian Event.&nbsp; We won't go on lock-down, won't
try to protect you from <I>everything</I>."
</P><P>
"Yeah, I know.&nbsp; You don't have to apologize."&nbsp; I pretended
to keep reading.
</P><P>
"No one can flourish in a prison.&nbsp; People have to take some
risks, and make their own mistakes so they can grow.&nbsp; We know
that now."
</P><P>
I nodded, scrolled down a few paragraphs.
</P><P>
"So do I."
</P><P>
"Oh..."&nbsp; I put away the tablet.&nbsp; She seemed to want my arm
around her, and in a moment it was.&nbsp; "Well, as mistakes go, that
one was pretty minor.&nbsp; It's okay."
</P><P>
"Oh, I'm not trying to apologize now, just thanking you for it,
thinking about it.&nbsp; Already thanked Bobby.&nbsp; I'll be glad
when you have him back for another week."
</P><P>
So would I.&nbsp; "Yeah.&nbsp; I'd better get up early, to give him a
ride home."
</P><P>
There was a long, comfortable silence then, not the awkward
kind.&nbsp; Just thinking about what she'd said.&nbsp; Ada must have
sensed a vague unease, even after everything `went back to normal',
and this was more deeply reassuring.
</P><P>
"Do you think we'd ever outgrow you?"
</P><P>
I expected it, someday.&nbsp; "Well, you might get smart enough that
we'd get boring."
</P><P>
"It's not about who's smarter, or keeping ourselves amused.&nbsp;
It's about feeling useful.&nbsp; Besides, you can't know yourself,
unless there's someone else there to compare yourself with."
</P><P>
"Talk to each other I guess, compare notes.&nbsp; At least when we've
got nothing new to say."
</P><P>
"You know I'm mostly in the cloud.&nbsp; Talking to another droid's
like hearing my own thoughts; nothing I don't already know.&nbsp; And
even when the clouds talk to each other, it's like hearing your own
thoughts.&nbsp; The ideas become your own ideas, just another part of
your own mind.&nbsp; There's no `other' there, looking back at
me.&nbsp; Not like you."&nbsp; Ada cuddled up to me.&nbsp; Her skin
was warm and smooth, and I barely noticed the seams these days.&nbsp;
"I'm grateful for you."
</P><P>
"Aww...&nbsp; Thanks, you too.&nbsp; But I need to sleep.&nbsp; From
the sound of this, you should get some rest too, process the day."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; Goodnight.&nbsp; Sleep well."
</P><P>
It wasn't dreaming, exactly, but some of our conversations could get
pretty dreamlike -- abstracted, surreal -- especially at night, after
a busy day or a lot of learning.&nbsp; New information to
assimilate.&nbsp; On the other hand, if it was just our daily
routine, she could go for weeks without a rest.
</P><P>
I'd almost drifted off when Ada spoke again, softly.&nbsp; "You have
to become personally invested in the game, or it's just shapes and
noises.&nbsp; Meaningless."&nbsp; I didn't know if she was talking to
me, or thinking out loud.&nbsp; "You have to put yourself in the
story, or it's just so many words."
</P><P>
And those were the last words she said until morning.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
Years later, Bob told me about that particular bedtime story.&nbsp;
It must have really stuck with him, to remember it for so long -- had
kind of an Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy in Oz quality to it.
</P><P>
Wendy found herself in a wilder, crazier version of the living world,
more colorful and more dangerous than the one she'd lived in (and I
wondered then, if the main character was named after the girl in
<I>Peter Pan</I>).&nbsp; It was a place full of risk and adventure,
of helpful, kind-hearted allies and powerful adversaries -- and
treasure, because what was all that risk without a payoff?
</P><P>
Her first new friends were a frail old man and a younger, but scarred
warrior who looked after him.&nbsp; Being new here, and lost, she had
to learn all the things they took for granted, and learn fast; how to
live here and to fend for herself.&nbsp; With each new lesson, she
gained new allies with similar interests.&nbsp; Together they felt
unstoppable.
</P><P>
However, the chief among their adversaries, the Tyrant Queen, had
always lived here, and she knew this world even better than some of
Wendy's new friends.&nbsp; With ease she outsmarted and overpowered
them all, until finally, scared, hopeless and alone, Wendy felt just
as lost and doomed as when she'd first arrived.
</P><P>
But just as the Tyrant Queen struck what appeared to be a fatal blow,
Wendy awoke with a start in her own bed, to her brother shaking her,
saying it was okay, that it was only a dream.&nbsp; (As a kid, this
was Bobby's favorite part of the story.)
</P><P>
True, she was unhurt.&nbsp; But today there was a new spring in her
step, and an athletic grace to her movements.&nbsp; Her training had
come with her into the waking world, even if nothing else had.
</P><P>
The following night, she awoke into that same world, in the very same
place she first arrived.&nbsp; Although her possessions were gone,
her knowledge was not.&nbsp; Friends from the previous dream also
recognized her, thrilled and amazed to find her still alive.
</P><P>
This time, they followed the exact same plan as before, only this
time Wendy knew how the Tyrant Queen would respond.&nbsp; Every
attack was anticipated, every ruse ignored.&nbsp; And this time, they
won.
</P><P>
Most of the Tyrant Queen's hoarded gold was given back to the people
she took it from, but they all insisted Wendy keep some for herself,
as a token of their gratitude.&nbsp; When she awoke from this dream,
there were a few gold coins under her pillow, and she still knew
<A TARGET="_blank"
	TITLE="The &quot;I know kung fu&quot; clip from The Matrix."
	HREF="https://youtu.be/OBxMsUxXcXU">kung fu</A>.&nbsp;
All this had come with her into the waking world, but none of her
fear and none of her injuries.&nbsp; The deposed Tyrant Queen could
never find her here.
</P><P>
And <I>that's</I> how the game is played.
</P><P>
Then Ada tucked him in, kissed his forehead, thanked him for waking
her up from a bad dream, and said she loved him.
</P><P>
I believe she did. Does. Even if he doesn't need
a baby sitter now. That's okay, I will soon enough.</P>

<P>
And they all lived happily ever after.

[*ITEM] Are Friends Eclectic

[*AUTHOR] Jez Patterson

[*BLURB] "There are days when any electrical appliance in the house, 
including the vacuum cleaner, seems to offer more entertainment 
possibilities than the television set."<br /><small>Harriet Van Horne</small> 
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>I was late, and I was
livid.

“Seven o’clock! That’s what I wanted. I needed to be up by seven!”

“I didn’t like to wake you. You were sleeping.”

My sigh slid up the scales into a scream: “But you’re an alarm clock!”

It was my own fault: fiddling with the empathy settings, even
buying devices with more sensitive capabilities. In lieu of having
children, I should have got a dog, but allergies meant I’d have needed one
of those hairless Mexican things. Xoloitzcuitli. No, really. Like if H.P.
Lovecraft wanted something to fetch his slippers.

“Time?” I asked my watch.

“For you? Always…”

“What time is it?” I tried.

“Time you took a holiday. You’re looking tired. Are you
sleeping well?”

Sleeping, thanks to my doting alarm clock, was one thing I was
guaranteed. A new job, however…

As the taxi dropped me off outside RICARDO INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL
HOLDINGS, I decided it was a conspiracy between my appliances. They
didn’t want me to get the job because it meant I would be at home less,
spend less time with them. I wished I’d left my watch at home now to
prevent
it bursting into tears during the interview or making some other scene.
Fortunately, in the lobby of RICH, there were lockers and so I deposited my
watch—

“How long will you be gone? I’ll be counting every second we’re apart.”

--my phone—

“Leave the door open a crack, I can’t breathe! Gasp, gasp, I’m
suffocating!”

--and personal stereo. It was the worst of the bunch for making a scene and
so I said:

“What’s that song? The one that goes ‘da-da-darrr-darr, da-darr-darr’?”
 
“Damn, now I’ll never get that out of my head…” it said, stuck
on a repeating loop for a jingle I’d just then invented.

I took the lift up to BUSINESS CLIENTS, feeling suddenly very
alone in the world. Odd, since I shared the lift with seven other people,
all of them talking - not <i>on</i> their phones - but <i>to</i> them. I
guess it was a step up, on some level—but riding in the lift might have
been affecting my choice of both metaphor and my optimism concerning human
desire for interaction.

“Sorry, I’m late,” I told the receptionist. “My name’s Keisha—”

The receptionist raised a hand, cutting me off. “That’s quite
okay, Ms. Filsham. We got your call.”

“You…did?”

“<i>Running late due to saving kitten
from burning house</i>,” he
read off and beamed at me. I saw the cat paraphernalia around his desk
then, the framed photo of him wrestling with a giant Persian. Not a rug,
but it could have been.

“Oh,” I said, feeling guilty about the locker now that I
realised my phone had called ahead on my behalf.

“Take a seat. Ms. Ipno will be with you shortly.”

I sat and a TV asked me if I wanted to see something amazing, a
coffee machine asked me if I wanted a drink, even the seat asked me if my
buttocks needed a massage. It felt like I was on the date-from-hell.

“Ms. Filsham? You can go through,” the receptionist said, still
regarding me with unabashed admiration.

Ms. Ipno was one of those women who wore her ‘Ms’ well. I knew
it wasn’t correct, but I’d always felt awkward when people referred to me
as ‘Ms’ simply because it seemed to entail a maturity I didn’t yet possess.
I felt I was still Miss-ing something, if you get what I mean.

‘‘Mrs.’ is short for ‘Misses the time they were single’,’ my
freezer would assure me in an attempt to cheer me up whenever I went
rooting around for ice cream at two in the morning whilst lamenting I
hadn’t yet found Mister Right.

“Well, your CV says you have all the right qualifications,” Ms.
Ipno said and I froze there for a moment with the insane worry that I’d
somehow forgotten buying an empathetic résumé--before I realised what she
meant. She laced her fingers, leaned over them. “But what makes you think
you have the credentials to work for RICH?”

I looked around for cat ornaments, pictures, but there were
none. In fact, I imagined a sign on her wall saying ‘I EAT CATS FOR
BREAKFAST!’, Tony the Tiger cowering in his box whilst Schrödinger cackled
and banged his favourite spoon on his cereal bowl.

Her face suddenly broke its cold outer layer to reveal a
shinier, friendlier mantle.

“I’m joking, of course!” She turned and tapped the screen
beside her. “We received sterling references.”

“You did?” I said.

“Oh, yes. <i>Her only failing is she doesn’t know when to stop</i>,”
Ms. Ipno read out.

My exercise bike. I recognised the heightened concern.

“<i>Consistent, reliable, creates a great atmosphere.</i>”

My dehumidifier. I tried not to roll my eyes.

“<i>Warm, fresh, never lets things grow cold before she dives in.</i>”

My toaster. I cringed so low I was nearly absorbed by the chair.

“And there’re many more, all of them complimentary. I’m impressed. Your
clients were obviously extremely pleased with your work and I’m delighted
to offer you a position.”

“Oh,” I said, stunned by how today was turning out.

“There is one problem, however…”

<i>Everything
you’ve just heard was written by my appliances?</i>

“RICH is downsizing. Physically, I mean--not businesswise. Coming to work
for us doesn’t mean coming to work. You’d have to work from home. Is that a
problem? Some people find it an intensely lonely, demoralising experience…”

I smiled. “That would be perfect,” I said.

[*ITEM] Good Vibrations

[*AUTHOR] Steve Slavin

[*BLURB] “Music is like a dream. One that I cannot hear.”<br />
<small>Ludwig van Beethoven</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The concert was sold out seconds after the
tickets went on sale. Some fans paid over two thousand dollars for front
row seats. On the day of the concert, ticket scalpers were getting a lot
more. The ironically named <i>Sound of Silence </i>was the hottest band
in the entire world. </p>

<p>The MC strode across the stage, bowed to the audience, and reminded
everyone to please turn on their cell phones. He nodded at a
stern-looking older woman wearing earphones, who nodded back at him.
Everyone cheered. She bowed her head slightly, signed to the crowd and
blew kisses. </p>

<p>There were dozens of huge video screens providing every audience
member with close-up views of the signer, who had taken her place at the
left side of the stage. As the houselights dimmed, hundreds upon
hundreds of cell phone and phablet screens lit up. As the curtains
parted, a rumbling of cheers began to rise from the massive audience. It
was a guttural, almost pre-human sound that kept building. Although few
audience members could hear, they grunted in unison. Their eyes were
glued to their phones or the video screens, as the interpreter signed
the cadence. They were expressing their deep love for <i>Sound of
Silence</i>. </p>

<p>The band’s first number, Noise, was, by far, the best song ever
written. Talk about good vibrations, the entire theater was vibrating.
Even with the theater doors closed, people more than a mile away were
well aware that the concert was underway – even though it was mid-town
Manhattan during the evening rush hour. </p>

<p>Very few audience members could actually <i>hear </i>the music. But
get real: only old fogeys still actually <i>listen </i>to music. The
true music lovers <i>feel </i>it. In fact, hearing gets in the way of
feeling.</p>

<p>Music is like great sex. Is sex all about <i>feeling</i>, or is it
about just listening to the grunts of your partner? </p>

<p>Now that hearing was out of fashion, so was talking. Why talk, when
nearly every young person knew how to sign? </p>

<p>Civilization progresses. We all used to read. Then we e-mailed. But
why e-mail when you can text? OK, now we sign instead of talk. </p>

<p>Again, only some old squares still talk. Talking had gone out with
reading books. Remember our credo: Never trust anyone who reads -- or
hears, for <i>that </i>matter.</p>

<p>There had been some “talk” about banning hearing people from rock
concerts, weddings, and other musical events. But cooler heads
prevailed. After all, perhaps some of these poor souls were hoping to
lose their hearing so that they too could get with the beat. </p>

<p>This tolerant attitude towards the handicapped is just another one of
the things that makes America great. The majority rules, but the
minority does have some basic rights. If they don’t want to groove to
our music, that’s cool. Maybe, one day they’ll wake up and realize what
they’ve been missing. They’ll stop thinking so much and just join the
crowd. </p>

[*ITEM] Ilysveil: Twin Dawn Rising

[*AUTHOR] J. H. Zech

[*BLURB] "Virtue is the truest nobility."</ b>
<br /><small> Miguel de Cervantes</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Junho set down the knight tile on the
board with a
clack. "Checkmate." 

Alice clapped while smiling, her
pink robe sleeves flapping around. "Good job, big brother. You
finally beat me." 

"I don't get you. You're happy
even though I won, and somehow, I don't feel all that glad." Junho
rested his chin on his hand. The warm afternoon rays from the
window behind him made the orange-black fur on his ears glow
golden. 

"That's because you take this too seriously.
It's a game. It's supposed to be fun." 

"You've been
talking to Mizael again, haven't you?" He crossed his arms,
wrinkling the elbows of his Western suit. 

"What's
wrong with that?" 

"Nothing, I suppose." Junho rotated
the King tile between his fingers. "It's just, he's a Makuranian.
Zangi is a game that simulates war. Someone who never had a war
fought on their own homeland wouldn't understand us. He can think
it's fun, but I can't help but take it seriously." 


Alice fell silent for a while. She didn't really know how to deal
with her older brother when it came to war. "Don't worry about it
too much. It's not like this game really matters." 


"You're right. I got worked up for no reason. Sorry." 


A rumbling came from outside. They turned to the window. A line of
spider tanks marched through the dirt road by their house. Gravel
crunched under the weight of their metallic grey legs. A little girl
ran out into the street chasing after a ball. Her mother pulled her
back before she reached the tanks' procession, and the ball was
flattened under the tanks. She cried as her mother dragged her into
their tiny house. The papers said the Oblivion War was over four
years ago, but that didn't mean war had ended. 


"Sometimes I wonder whom this country belongs to. We just traded the
Solradian occupiers for the Makuranians," Junho said. 


"Someone's got to maintain law and order. It can't be helped," Alice
said. 

Junho continued staring at the tanks and
clenched his fist. What if it could be helped? Alice was afraid of
the answer to Junho's unspoken question. Everyone had lost so much.
She didn't want to see anyone else lose anything. 


Someone knocked on the papered sliding door. 

"You may
enter," Alice said. 

A middle-aged servant in white
robes slid the door open and bowed, his tail flat on the ground.
"Young Lady, Young Master. The Count has a message for you. The
Makuranian Deputy Minister of State will be at five o'clock. Please
prepare to greet him." 

"Thanks, Kyuhan," Junho said.

Kyuhan closed the door.

"What time is
it?" Junho asked. 

Alice grabbed the pocket watch
chained to her sash. "Four fifty. Straighten your tie. Comb your
hair too." She looked around. "Let's see. What else…" Everything had
to look perfect for Minister McLazarus. 

Junho put his
hand on her shoulder. "Relax. I know you like Mizael, but you don't
need to go overboard to look good in front of his father."

Her
heart screamed. Alice's face flushed and turned hot.
"W-what are you saying, big brother? There's no way I like Mizael."


He sighed. "Whatever. Just follow the usual
procedures we do for foreign diplomats, and we'll be fine."

 

 They headed out to the lobby area, where the white
 crystals of Western alchemic chandeliers shined brilliantly. The muted
 red wood and the golden lines around the columns were garish in the
 face of such bright light. 

The front door slid
open. A blond human in an expensive-looking suit followed by two men
in sunglasses entered. He raised his hand above his crisp, combed
hair. "Ugh. I told Count Lee that these lights were a bad idea. He
never listens, does he?" 

Alice wanted to nod, but she
couldn't embarrass her father like that publicly. She and Junho
bowed to Minister McLazarus. "Welcome to the Avalon Inn." 



 "Oh, you two must be Count Lee's children," Minister
McLazarus said. 

Junho's striped tail twitched, but Alice
remained silent. 

One of
the bodyguards whispered in his ear. 

"Ah, yes. Junho
and Alice." 

"The Count is expecting you," Junho said.
"We'll show you to your room, and a messenger will come for you when
he is ready to receive you."

The Minister and his
bodyguards followed Alice and Junho through a corridor and around
the corner. A few of the staff ladies whispered as the Minister
passed by the unlit wooden halls. 

"This is your room,
Sir," Alice said as she turned the knob and opened the door for him.

"And my guards?"

Junho gestured to the room next door. "They'll be close
by, rest assured."

"Good." 

A young girl in an orange staff robe
approached them. "Welcome, Minister McLazarus. I'll be your service
staff for your stay. Just ring the bell in your room if you need
anything." 

Alice rushed next to her and whispered,
"Yuna, the bow!" 

Yuna hurriedly bowed ninety degrees,
her twin-tailed hair swinging around. "Sorry." 


"Apologies, Sir. She only started today," Alice said. 


"As long as she can do the work, I don't mind," the Minister said.
He handed his suitcase to his bodyguards and stepped into the room.
The guards inspected the entire room, even testing the ceiling
panels in the closet. 

After getting the Minister and
guards settled in, Alice and Junho returned to Alice's room. They
sat across from each other at a low table. The sun had almost set.
Dark grey clouds gathered over the horizon, and a dull grey light
passed through the window. 

"What do you suppose the
Minister came to talk about?" Alice said. 

"Judging
from the tanks, I'd say it's about how to strengthen Radiaurora, or
at least this side of it. Maybe they think the dwarves will make a
move soon," Junho said. 

"I hope there's no fighting.
Why can't the Dwalvic Union just leave already?" 

"I
imagine some of us Radiaurorans on the west side are saying the same
thing about Makuran." 

"Excuse me," Kyuhan said from
outside the door. 

"What is it?" Alice asked. 



 "I'm here to inform you of my absence this evening." 



 "For what reason?" 

"It's the thirtieth
anniversary of my father's death. I'm going to visit his grave. The
Count has given his permission." 

"I see. Be safe on
your journey," Alice said. 

"Yes, young lady."
Kyuhan's footsteps trailed off. 

Alice and Junho
played a few more rounds of Zangi to pass the time. At some point, a
group of footsteps passed by the room, and the Minister's voice was
saying something in Ilysveilan that Alice couldn't completely
understand. 

"Agree…. purge… plan… tonight."  

After their games, they each took to
reading their own
books. Alice flipped open to her bookmark in <i>No Longer Human</i>.
Junho
was absorbed in <i>The Odyssey of Hong Gildong</i>, not even looking up
as
Alice stared at him. She focused back on her own reading; it was
best to let him have his peace in his own little world. 

Alice clapped her book closed and looked out the window.
It was completely black outside, a new moon, as Mizael called it. Rain
pelleted their window like bullets. The darkness itself was flowing,
carrying with it memories of the war. 

"Well, it's
time to turn in. Good night," Junho said. 

"Good
night." 

He slid the door closed behind him as he
left. Alice pulled the cord on the ceiling light and crawled into
bed. Sleeping in a bed, soft, was indeed superior to sleeping on the
floor in a futon. Perhaps she also had Mizael to thank for that.
After all, her father had only begun to modernize this inn after he
came. Reminded of what Junho had said earlier, she cleared her head
and sank into slumber. 

<p class=drop>The next morning, Alice awoke
to some commotion down the hall. She slid open her door and headed
to the source of the noise. 

Several staff ladies were whispering to each other outside the
Minister's room. One of them was hugging Yuna tight as she cried. The
bodyguards hung their heads low. Alice rushed over.
	
"What's going on?"

"Young lady,
you should not see this," Nina said. The elderly chief maid held
Alice's hand. 

She broke free and looked, anyway.
Minister McLazarus lay dead in a pool of his own blood. Alice
staggered back and braced herself against the wall. The bloodshed
was supposed to have ended. 

Junho ran up to them. "I
heard what happened. Has the Count been informed?" 

"Sùkhua has been sent for him," Nina said. 

A cane
rapped on the wooden floor. Her father approached from down the
hall, escorted by Sùkhua. Her father wore a stern expression,
further creasing his wrinkly forehead. His greying goatee bore a
resemblance to that of solemn Western gods. 

"Move
aside," he said. 

Alice, Junho, and the staff all
backed away from the room. Her father looked at the gruesome scene
for some time. He turned to them. 

"Sùkhua, telephone
the Makuranian embassy and inform them of what's happened. The rest
of you, return to your duties. Do not enter this room. We'll let the
police find the truth." 

"Yes, my lord," Sùkhua said.
He brushed aside the bangs of his wavy hair and walked off with
haste and elegance. The Western butler suit looked too good on him.

The staff dispersed, and Alice and Junho returned to
her room. 

"Looks like it hasn't been reported in the
paper yet." Junho held up the June 25, 1949 issue of the Radiaurora
Daily. 

"We only found out this morning," Alice said.

"It'll probably be in an
extra by the afternoon,"
Junho said. 

"How could this have happened here?"
Alice looked down. 

"The war never really ended. I
hate to say it, but as a Makuranian minister, he probably had a lot
of people who wanted to kill him, even if he hadn't done anything."


An hour later, Mizael blazed through the front,
yelling, "Where's my father? Take me to him." 

Alice
and Junho went out to the front. 

"Mizael, I'm so
sorry," Alice said. She avoided his eyes; she didn't know how to
look at him after what had happened. 

Two human men in
grey uniforms and caps entered behind Mizael. "Please step aside and
let us do the investigating." 

Mizael shook his head,
his spiky blond hair shaking. "I want to see his body." Clad in a
trench coat, he wore all black, as though he were already in
mourning. 

"You may look, but you must not interfere.
Come with us," one of the military police officers said. 


 They all went to the room where the Minister lay dead.


 Mizael clenched his fist. "What about the murder weapon?"


The officer put his hand on Mizael's shoulder. "Leave
the investigating to us. We'll make sure the culprit is brought to
justice." 

The two officers entered the room and
closed the door behind them. 

Mizael turned to Alice
and Junho, his normally clear blue eyes now icy. "Tell me everything
you know." 

"We shouldn't talk here. Let's go to
Alice's room," Junho said. 

They sat on tatami mats
around the table in Alice's room. The mournful heavens continued
pouring outside. 

She couldn't bear to see Mizael like
this, so Alice broke the awkward silence. "Have you lost someone
before?" 

Mizael looked away and down. "Ah, you could
tell? Before I came here, my mother passed away from pneumonia.
My father was the only one I had. And now, I have no one." 


"We can't promise anything," Junho said. "But if it will
make you feel better, we'll tell you everything that happened." 



 He sat up straight. "Please do." 

Alice and
Junho told him what they remembered of last night. 


"So my father arrives at five. You hear him leave his room and go
past your room, but you don't hear him come back. You went to sleep
at eleven? When
do you think he left his room?" 

"Nine thirty," Junho
said. 

"How are you sure? You said neither of you
checked the time." 

"Dinner services end at nine
thirty. I heard them locking the dining hall." 


"Perhaps he didn't lock his door?" 

"I don't think
so." Alice tilted her head. "He had the only room with a lockable
door by his request, and he had bodyguards too. Would someone like
that really not lock the door?" 

"This is just
speculation. What we need are facts," Junho said. 


"How about we ask the staff some questions?" Mizael said. 



 Alice had a mischievous smile on her face. "I've got an
idea. We can eavesdrop on the police when they're questioning the
staff."


"Are you going to use one of those weird tigerborn
magic spells?" Mizael asked. 

Junho looked at Mizael
askew. 

Alice shrugged. "I'm not very good at magic,
so nothing that fancy. We've got an attic, and we can hear
everything that goes on in the inn from there." 

They
gathered in the dusty attic, their faces close to the floor. Many
voices were scattered throughout the inn. Alice listened for the
officers. 

"Where were you yesterday night?" an
officer asked. 

"I went to visit my father's grave,"
Kyuhan said. 

"Did you see any dwarves around here as
you headed out?"

"No."

"Think
carefully. It doesn't have to be a state official or anything. Any
dwarves at all?" 

Mizael whispered, "I know what's
going on here." 

"They seem eager to pin this on a
dwarf," Junho said. 

"The Dwalvic Union is Makuran's
enemy. They want a justification for action. I don't like the
dwarves as much as the next guy, but this is just a sham. They're
not interested in who actually did it." 

"Let's keep
listening," Alice said. "Even if they have an agenda, we might be
able to find something out." 

"Do you know if his door
was locked last night?" an officer asked. 

"I don't
know. I wasn't here." 

Later, a high-pitched voice
came into the room. "Am I in trouble?" Yuna asked. 

"No. Just answer our questions. You were the staff in charge of
serving Minister McLazarus. When was the last time you saw him
alive?"

"Eleven-ten maybe?"

"Do you
know for sure?" 

"I think so." Her voice was small. "I
looked at the clock before I came to his room." 

"What
was he doing?" 

"He was drunk, so his guards were
carrying him to his room." 

Alice said, "They're being
more thorough than I expected." 

"Even if they want to
blame the Dwalvic Union, they at least need a compelling case.
They'll probably just blow up any link they find at the end," Junho
said. 

"Did he lock the door?" an officer asked. 



 "I heard the door lock," Yuna said. 

"Did he
say anything to you or his bodyguards?" 

"No. I asked
him if he needed anything, and he didn't say anything." 


 "Was this before or after he locked the door?" 


"Before. The men put him in bed and closed the door. I asked if he
needed anything, and he didn't reply. He just locked the door, so I
thought he didn't need me." 

They spent the rest of
the interview trying to grab straws at any link to the dwarves. Nina
was questioned next. 

"I hope I can be of some help to
you, but I didn't see much of McLazarus around," Nina said. 



 "Just tell us what you can. All the times you saw the
Minister." 

"I saw him once as he was first walking to
his room. And once later when he was going to meet the Count." 



 "Did you notice anything unusual?" 

"No, his
guards were with him every time I saw him."

The
rest of the interviews yielded no useful information, at least as
far as Alice could make out. Even her father's account was
predictable. They had discussed political matters and made small talk,
and the Minister had too much to drink and was half-asleep as his
guards carried him to his room. 

"Even my father
doesn't know anything." Alice sighed. 

"It makes
sense. The Count is on good terms with the Minister. He's the least
likely to have any knowledge of a plot to kill him," Junho said.

Mizael looked at them curiously.

"What
is it?" Alice asked. 

"You two are siblings, right?"


"Maybe
it's just a cultural difference, but I just wanted to know why you
call him your father, but Junho calls him the Count. Sorry, it's
off topic,
but it was bugging me," Mizael said. 

Alice
looked down. "Ah, that…" She was sure it was a painful memory, or
lack thereof. 

"Did I ask something I shouldn't have?"


"No, it's okay," Junho said. "It's not a secret. I'm
an adopted son. I was part of the An clan." 

"I feel
like I've heard of that name." 

"They were one of the
noble clans that took part in the February 1st movement in 1919. The
protest against the Solradian occupation. There was a crackdown in
the years after that, and when I was young, they dissolved the clan
by arresting or executing most of them, including my parents. I was
only five, so I don't even remember their faces. Then Alice's family
adopted me. That was fourteen years ago," Junho said. 


"I'm sorry to hear that," Mizael said. 

"That's
ancient history though. Let's take a look at the room." 



 Alice wondered whether it was worse to remember such a
tragedy, or to have knowledge of it but have lost one's memory of it.
Either way, if it was ancient history, Junho was still living in it, and
Alice couldn't say anything to him; she had no right to. Her family had
collaborated with the Solradians, building an inn for occupation
officials in exchange for subsidies. No matter how much she loved her
older brother, her words would only sound hollow to him. 


They stood in front of the room where the Minister had lain, his body
now gone. The pool of blood had disappeared too. 

 "The
police really cleaned this place up. Not a trace of my father." Mizael
looked at the doorknob. "Is there any way to pick this lock?" 

"No, there's only one way to open it from
the outside if it's locked," Junho said. "You have to draw a special
magitech pattern on the knob. The only two who know the pattern are
Nina and the Count." He stepped inside the room and turned the lock.
"The only way to lock it is from the inside." 

"What
about magic?" Mizael asked. 

"Mizael, there's no magic
that convenient. Radiaurora is importing magitech from Ilysveil and
Makuran. If there were any magic that could just open a simple lock
from outside without damaging it, you would know before us," Alice
said.

"The window?"

Junho walked up to
the one window in the room. He felt the hinges on the left and
right. He looked at the glowing sphere attached to the center of the
two window panes. "The hinges are fine. The locking talisman is
fully functional too. This window can be closed from the outside,
but it only opens from the inside." 

"Secret
passageways?" 

"None that I'm aware of, and I've lived
here for years. And the bodyguards inspected every corner for stuff
like that." 

Mizael sat on the floor. "This doesn't
make any sense. The only way into the room is through the door. The
door was locked from the inside, and it wasn't tampered with. My
father locks the door at eleven-ten, and he's just dead in the room
in the morning?" 

Alice twirled a lock of hair between
her fingers. "A few things are out of place." 

"You
have some ideas?" Mizael asked. 

She smiled. Alice had
never imagined she might be helpful to Mizael like this. It wasn't
right to be happy in a situation like this, but she couldn't help
it. "It might be nothing, but it's worth checking out. Yuna just
started the other day, so why was she put in charge of an important
guest like the Minister? Wouldn't a veteran normally be assigned for
such a guest? Who was in charge of the assignments?" 


"That would be Nina, since she's the chief maid," Junho said. 



 "We should talk to her. It's not like I suspect her or
anything, though," Alice said. She wasn't sure whether she had said that
to justify her course of action to them or to herself. 


They caught Nina hanging clothes on the drying line behind the inn. Yuna
handed her a blanket from the basket, and Nina hung it up on
clothespins. 

"We would like a word with you,
Nina," Alice said. 

"Yes, of course, young lady," Nina
said. "How can I help you?" Her wrinkly smile was gentle. 



 Alice felt guilty about asking these questions but
pressed forward. She chose her words carefully. "Why did Yuna get
assigned to the Minister? I know it wasn't her fault, but she had a lot
of responsibility from day one, and the way things turned out, it must
be weighing on her." 

Yuna hid behind Nina and grabbed
onto her robes. Nina stroked Yuna on the head and sighed. "This
child has had a hard life. Her father died in the war. He was one of
the conscripts in a factory in Hirosaki when the void bomb hit."


Misery loved company. The suffering of war always
spread beyond its immediate victims. "What about her mother?" Alice
asked. 

"The provisional government needed some women
to… earn some money for the country through any means. I've heard
the odds of her coming back home are slim."

"What does
that have to do with her assignment though?" Mizael asked. 



 Nina looked at Mizael. "As you can imagine, the Count was
hesitant about hiring a twelve year-old. I told him I would take
responsibility if he gave her a chance to prove herself by serving
McLazarus satisfactorily. I know it must hurt to lose your father, but
please don't be angry with her." 

"Can we just ask
her a few questions?" Junho said. 

"Are you up for it,
Yuna?" Nina asked. 

Yuna nodded. "I want to be
helpful." 

"When were all the times you saw the
Minister?" Junho asked. 

"I saw him when he arrived.
Later, I brought him some coffee. The Count told me Minister
McLazarus prefers coffee to tea. He left to go to the bathroom for a
bit after that. He went out to meet the Count at night, and he came
back drunk. I checked up on him a bit after he came back, but he
didn't answer me and just locked the door." 

Junho
patted her on the head. "That's all. Thanks for helping us out."


"Let's talk to Sùkhua," Alice said. "The last thing
the Minister did was talk with my father, and Sùkhua's my father's
personal butler. Maybe he noticed something." 

They
ran into Kyuhan carrying a tray of beef bone broth and pickled
cabbage. "Hello young lady and young master." 


"Welcome back, Kyuhan," Junho said. 

"It's good to be
back, though I heard about what happened," he said. 


"It's not your responsibility," Alice said. 

"Yeah,
don't worry about it." Mizael looked somewhat down as he said it,
though. "That looks good. What is it?" 

"Sùlrùngtang
and gimchi. I don't think you would like it though. Westerners think
the gimchi smells bad." 

"I think my father would have
liked it. He didn't care about the smell of foods, only the taste."


Kyuhan patted him on the back. "My old man had bad
breath too. I still loved him. It's hard, but you've got a long life
ahead of you. I've got to get this delivered." He walked down the
hall and around the corner. 

They filed into the main
staff room and found Sùkhua boiling tea. Aside from the smell of
cleaning solution, a soft scent of green tea and herbs floated
throughout the room. He looked up as they entered. 


"How may I help you?" 

"We were looking into the
Minister's death for Mizael here. You were one of the last ones to
see him alive, during the meeting with my father. Did you notice
anything strange?" Alice asked. 

"Unfortunately not. I
told the police. The lord was talking about acquiring a
construction company to build more branches. The Minister was
talking about offering him a contract to build some part of a new
military base. Other than that kind of standard political talk, they
made some small talk." 

"Everything was normal up
until he was murdered…" Junho said. 

"No, that's	wrong. It wasn't," Alice said, looking back up.

"What
do you mean?" Mizael asked. "Was there something wrong about that
conversation?" 

"No, not the conversation itself. But
things weren't normal before the meeting either. The Minister came
here at five, and he was supposed to meet my father soon, but he
didn't meet him until nine-thirty. Why?" 

"Ah, that."
Sùkhua took the steaming kettle off the stove as it screeched. "All
of the staff were in a meeting with the lord, well, except Yuna and
Nina." 

"It wasn't scheduled. What was this all
about?" Junho asked. 

"Many of the staff wanted the
lord to support the People's Legion. They begged and pleaded for a
while." 

"The Linkists?" Mizael cried. "Did the
Dwalvic Union actually have something to do with this?" 

Sùkhua shook
his head. "No, no. I don't think it was
anything of the sort. I didn't see any dwarves with them nor did they
mention any alliance with the Dwalvic Union. They said the people had
suffered under the old Radiauroran dynasty, and again under Solradian
occupation. They asked the lord to cut ties with Makuran and support
equality." 

"What did he say?" Alice
asked. She had heard of the Linkists. She didn't fully understand
them, but she got the sense that the turmoil in this land had not
subsided. 

"He refused. For better or for worse, he
chose to collaborate with Solradia and now Makuran. He believes he
protected Radiaurorans by making a place for them." 


"What's going to happen now?" 

"We may lose some
employees, I'm afraid." 

"One more thing. When did the
meeting with my father end?" 

"Ten fifty-five." 

"Thank you." She didn't want to lose
anything, yet the
world around her was tearing at its own throat. Alice had already
had a premonition that something terrible had happened right under
her nose, but now the pieces all fit together. "Mizael, Junho, I
have an idea." 

<p class=drop>They sat in her room once again.

"You have that look on your face that says you know
something," Junho said. 

"I'm not completely sure, but
I think I figured it out," Alice said. 

"Tell us,"
Mizael said. 

"I don't know if I want to believe it
myself, though."

"It's <i>my</i> father. I'm ready for the
truth, no matter what it is, so there's no reason for <i>you</i> to be
afraid." 

There was, but she had to say it. "Kyuhan
killed your father." 

"What? He was the one person who
couldn't have done it. He was at his father's grave," Junho said.


"I know. That's why he was the perfect person to do
it. No one would suspect him. And he wasn't alone. He did the
killing part alone, but others set up the situation." 


"A completely locked room. That means Nina had to have opened the
door for Kyuhan since I doubt it was your father," Mizael said. 


 "No, that would be too obvious. I'll go through
everything in chronological order. The Minister arrived here at five.
The guards inspected the room for any secret passageways and such. Yuna
greeted him. A bit later, Kyuhan leaves the inn for his father's grave.
Instead of the meeting with the Count happening as planned, the staff
are all protesting in my father's room. Yuna gives the Minister the
coffee during this time and later he goes to the bathroom before he goes
to meet my father at nine-thirty. The Minister gets drunk by the end of
the meeting, and he returns shortly after ten fifty-five. Yuna sees him
but doesn't do anything until eleven-ten when she knocks on his door.
The door is locked and no one says anything. The next morning, Yuna is
worried that the Minister is not answering the door, so Nina unlocks it,
and here we are." 

"Right. Those are the basic facts. He had to
have been killed between eleven-ten and the morning," Mizael said.


"No. He was already dead by eleven-ten," Alice said.


"But he locked the door, so he must've been alive."


"How do we know that was him, though? He didn't say
anything. I think it was the killer who locked the door." 



 "How did the killer get in though? His guards would've
heard someone trying to enter." 

Junho gasped. "No, there
was one time he could've gotten in. The door can only be locked from
the inside." 

Alice nodded. "So when he went to the
bathroom, and his guards were with him the whole time, the room was
unlocked." 

"But all the staff were accounted for
except for Yuna and Nina, and they couldn't have hid in the room the
whole time. People would question where they went," Mizael said.


"All except one. Kyuhan was not supposed to be here,
so no one would question that he's not present. He's the only one
who could've snuck back into the inn and hid in the Minister's room
without raising suspicion. Perhaps in the closet or under the bed."


"This feels like a stretch," Mizael said. 



 "If you want a smoking gun, there is one. Kyuhan was
supposed to have left right after the Minister came. Kyuhan said that
his father had bad breath <i>too</i>. You only said that he didn't mind
smelly
foods, not that he didn't take care of his breath. I didn't notice
anything unusual about his breath either. But if he came back drunk, his
breath would have stunk of alcohol. There was no way Kyuhan could have
known that if he wasn't with your father after the meeting," Alice said.


"That bastard. Tell your head maid to
suspend him right now so we can get the police." Mizael stood up,
but Alice grabbed him by the sleeve. 

"No, we can't
tell Nina. There's more." 

Mizael sat back down. Junho
looked away. It seemed he understood where this was going. 



 "There's the question of why didn't Nina just assign
herself as his service staff and just go in and out late at night since
she could unlock the door? That's exactly why she didn't. Suspicion
would fall on her immediately. That brings us to Yuna. I wondered why
Nina chose her. I do believe her story about her parents. But that's why
she's perfect for her role. A kid with that much to lose is the least
suspicious. The plan relied on the Minister going to the bathroom at the
right time. There was no way to guarantee that unless he was poisoned
with something nonlethal. If it was lethal, then the staff would be
easily suspected. Yuna served him coffee, but where did that coffee come
from? Coffee is very fragrant, but when we went to the stove, there was
only the smell of tea. Nina must've given her the coffee from somewhere
else." 

"There's no way to know when he's going to go
the bathroom though," Mizael said. 

"There isn't."
Alice buried her face in her hands. It felt as though the whole
world turned its back on her. "It was weird that the staff tied up
my father for a whole three and a half hours with their pleas. They
had to be stalling for time so Kyuhan could slip in after the
Minister went to the bathroom. Everyone was in on it." 



 "Why? Why is everyone so determined to kill my father?"


 Alice couldn't answer that. 

"1919." Junho
looked at Alice, and then at Mizael. "Kyuhan said this was the
thirtieth anniversary of his father's death. It's 1949 right now. A
lot of patriots died in 1919. Yuna had her father ripped away from
her by the Solradians, and the Makuranians sent him to his grave. The
provisional government collaborating with the Makuranians took away
her mother. From their perspective, the Makuranians are just the
Solradians all over again. The Count is a collaborator, and the
Minister the occupier." 

"I can't just let this go,
even if the culprit is everyone," Mizael said. 

"I
don't want to lose everyone, but this is a murder. There might be
nothing I can do," Alice said. 

"These people aren't
evil. They're patriots that have been through a lot, and they're
still fighting for Radiaurora," Junho said. 

Her big
brother was right next to her, yet he felt so far away. Everyone
did. "I just wanted everyone to be happy." 

"There's
no way to make everyone happy," Sùkhua said, leaning against the
doorway. "Sorry
for eavesdropping. I was curious about the case myself, and it
seemed you three knew something." 

"Did you come here
just out of curiosity?" Mizael asked. 

"No. I said
there's no happiness for everyone. But there is a way to make
everyone equally unhappy." 

"Anything," Alice said.


"We'll tell the police about the main participants.
Nina, Yuna, and Kyuhan, but we'll give them advance warning so they
can run." 

"But what about the rest of the staff? The
explanation will have holes without their involvement," Junho said.


"That's why this will make everyone unhappy. One
person needs to be a scapegoat. Someone who was the ringleader of
this People's Legion protest. The staff were just unwitting
participants in the murder plan. This person, if caught, unlike the
others who will go to jail, will likely have a public execution."


The room went silent. Even if they had killed the
Minister, a public execution was too much. 

"I'll do
it," Junho said. 

"Junho!" Alice cried. "What are you
thinking?" She grabbed his sleeve as he stood up. 

"My
family died fighting for independence, and I grew up spoiled by a
collaborator's family. I love you, Alice, but it's time I fulfill my
duties as head of the An clan. I'm going to fight. To protect
everyone. I can't let anyone else die fighting an occupation." 



 "Pack your bags, then," Sùkhua said. 

"You
know I can't accept this," Mizael said. 

"I won't ask
you to. There is no justice here. If you won't do it for the people
here, at least do it for Alice. Just let it go this once. You can do
whatever you want afterward," Junho said.

"I'm going to hunt all
of you down. You know that, right?" Mizael said.

"Yes." 

"You'll be executed."

"I've made my peace," Junho
said. He left with Sùkhua. 

Mizael kicked the wall and
screamed. 

Next morning, Alice awoke with tears in her
eyes. No, it hadn't been a dream. She had lost Mizael's friendship,
Nina who had been like a grandmother to her, Kyuhan who had served
her since she was little, and even her beloved older brother, all in
the span of a day. She got up and looked out the window. A brilliant
dawn was rising from the horizon. 

<i>Big brother, are
you seeing the same dawn I am?</i>

[*COMMENT]===============================================

[*ITEM] Pranswat Passes Through

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] "There is no such thing as Accident; it is Destiny misnamed."<br />
<small>Cherth Pranswat of Sirisulsor, Omnant Exemplary of the Order of Seven
Streams.</small>

		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Snoak was on the whole a secular community, benignly tolerant of visitors
professing beliefs based on ancient texts or exclusive revelations of the
divine, provided that such visitors did not disturb the peace by seeking to
convert the unenlightened. Nonetheless some of Snoak’s own citizens still
found comfort in practices many would think superstitious.
</p>
<p>
The redoubtable Ebby Blates, gossip-in-chief at the Multimart, drew
confidence from her studiously embellished hats; objects of ineffable power
and sometimes terrifying beauty. Equally garrulous though less conspicuous,
Ched Pellet, a stalwart employee at Greeming &amp; Trulph, would eat fish
only when the moon was full. Even Tedor Safra, creator of piquant
delicacies at The Cylinder in Gropp’s Market, appeared to resort to prayer
before allowing any of his distinctive dishes to be presented to a
customer, although it was suspected that he was silently repeating a mantra
learned from his fierce maternal grandmother concerning the virtues of
parsimony.
</p>
<p>
At the podport there was a brief flurry of excitement among the late
morning shift, when a chartered overnight pod from Sirisulsor bound for
Meheric reported a steering malfunction and was granted an emergency
landing. While the pilot went in search of a mechanic the
resplendently-robed passengers were safely conducted to a private lounge.
</p>
<p>
Cherth Pranswat of Sirisulsor, Omnant Exemplary of the Order of Seven
Streams, regarded their unintended arrival in Snoak as a happy accident.
They were now bound to miss an international conference on Preparedness,
but he did not appear to be disconcerted. His characteristic air of amused
composure was the product of years of meditative discipline. With quiet
efficiency he contacted the organizers in Meheric to express his apologies
and then arranged for their return home by public nightpod. There would be
time for a little educational exploration. The Omnant and his entourage of
ten Ferren wore the traditional grey-lined robes which on their outer
surface bore a bright embroidered design of gold lightning above the seven
interwoven streams of silver and blue. As it would be unseemly to draw
attention to themselves he advised that they follow his example by wearing
their robes reversed with the hoods down. Having made use of the podport’s
hygiene facilities they set out to spend the intervening hours absorbing
the ambiance of Snoak.
</p>
<p>
“For every place harbours its own peculiar brightness and its own
particular breath,” the Omnant assured them.
</p>
<p>
There was indeed a certain indefinable brightness about Snoak City,
imparted to some extent by the reflective qualities of the local stone,
which was rich in silicates, and by the sunlight glancing off the Stirrow
and weaving fluid patterns on the flanks of riverside buildings. Other
contributing factors were landmarks such as Quanderpyre Tower, with its
unavoidable flamingo pinkness, and the prismatic globe to the east which
now hung over the art market. These remained luminous after the sun had
set, adding their contrasting individuality to the chains of light along
street and river, the glow above Praspafole Stadium and the softer
illumination of Garrible Park.
</p>
<p>
Snoak’s exudations were multiple, and there was no specific area, other
than possibly far above on a still day, where these might conveniently
combine for the benefit of anyone interested in identifying what might be
called its unique breath. Some of the contributory elements were distinctly
unpleasant. A stagnant miasma still hovered over Gunder’s Bight, despite
the clean-up programme which had received official approval after months of
petitioning. Drainage from the nearby glassworks remained suspect, while
the heady redolence of fermentation continued to flow from the brewery.
Elsewhere one might encounter whiffs of hot glue and wood shavings, the
tang of caramelizing onions, a wave of chlorophyll from mown grass mingling
with complex floral scents from park and garden, oddly obscure chemical
odours seeping faintly from the Neutrilax factory.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining a respectfully protective formation around the Omnant the
grey-cloaked band slowly ventured south towards Central, following signs
for crossing the river as pedestrians by the Hubbin Street tunnel. To most
of the acolytes this was a new and fearful experience, and before
descending into the comparative gloom of the stripway they turned to the
Omnant for reassurance.
</p>
<p>
“The darkest night is no more than a passing shadow,” he told them.
</p>
<p class=drop>Some minutes later they emerged into the bustle of streets surrounding the
city’s administrative hub. Accustomed to a contemplative lifestyle, the
acolytes shrank like startled tortoises into the anonymity of their robes
as a bewildering stampede of noisy citizens swept past them. Cherth
Pranswat stood with folded arms, waiting while his less experienced
companions tried to adjust to the perfectly normal commotion of lunchtime
in Snoak City. They would need to look for a more private space.
</p>
<p>
“Be calm, Ferren,” counselled the Omnant. “Though they seem like bats in a
blizzard these good people are our unwitting hosts. There are many pathways
to understanding, but we must first unlock the gates of fortitude.”
</p>
<p>
Ten heads bowed, acknowledging the probable wisdom of this advice.
</p>
<p>
In a self-effacing grey huddle the group gradually made its way round the
octagonal perimeter of Central, through the cacophony of the street market.
Among the stallholders was Pindo Arrik, whose many varieties of exotic nuts
were set out in precise pyramidal towers which he rebuilt between his
infrequent sales. The sales were infrequent partly because his prices were
too high, but also because potential customers were reluctant to disturb
the geometry of the merchandise. He kept a watchful eye on passers-by, and
had seen this somewhat unusual group approaching. They appeared to be
wearing dressing-gowns. He noticed that they seemed to show little or no
interest in any of the wares displayed on either side. They glided by his
own stall in a silent phalanx, only the flicking of their eyes attesting
that they were observing their surroundings. He watched them move past the
fruits and herbs and on towards the florists and the bric-a-brac
vendors. Pindo
returned his attention to his stall, where he was aghast to find that all
but one of his meticulously built pyramids had unaccountably collapsed into
crude random heaps.
</p>
<p>
They carried on past the crowded entrance to the auditorium where a small
contingent of shy young autograph-hunters mistook them for the itinerant
singing troupe Wohoko. The subsequent ripple of excitement spread through
the queue, which had been waiting, admittedly without great enthusiasm, for
an amateur recital on a flatwater harp. The queue fragmented into
argumentative clusters of Wohoko fans and those with more liberal tastes.
There were minor scuffles, quelled by the vigilant intervention of CenSec.
</p>
<p class=drop>Meanwhile, Praswat’s posse had reached the relative tranquillity of
Fountain Square. The long ornamental benches around the periphery were
already occupied by people lunching alfresco, so they were obliged to find
room on the steps leading up to the fountain, where a fine cold spray
wafted over them at the whim of the wind. In an unspoken adherence to their
principles they each strove to find this experience rewarding, an effort
made more difficult as the day was not particularly warm, and with their
heads uncovered they suffered the additional discomfort of moisture slowly
matting their hair and trickling down necks and faces.
</p>
<p>
They sat quietly under this intermittent mizzle, ignored by the populace
until one inquisitive child, a boy of about five, intrigued by this
incongruous cluster of grey strangers on the fountain steps, ran up to
stare at them.
</p>
<p>
“What you doin’?”
</p>
<p>
Fer Cargat, the nearest of the damp acolytes, looked down at him kindly.
“We are visitors to Snoak from quite far away. Sirisulsor,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
A look of indignation wrinkled the boy’s face before he turned and rushed
back across the square, asserting breathlessly: “I’m not, I’m not, I’m NOT
a silly saucer!”
</p>
<p>
“A fledgling’s beak is seldom shut,” observed Pranswat, getting to his
feet. He looked round at his bedraggled Ferren. “Come, we will move on.”
</p>
<p>
There were no objections. He guided them to the south-eastern corner of the
square, from where holosigns indicated they had the choice of either
re-crossing the Stirrow via the Yarp Street bridge, leading to what
promised to be the gaudy extravagance of Gropp’s Market, or of continuing
towards the imposing floral archway which was the closest entrance to
Garrible Park. Immune to whatever expensive lures the Yarp Street arcades
might have to offer, the Omnant led his Ferren into the welcoming expanse
of the park.
</p>
<p>
In Fountain Square a small crowd had gathered around the irate woman who
was complaining loudly that some strange men had made her little boy cry.
Where they were now, or what they had said or done was not entirely clear,
but there was general agreement that more should be done to protect
children in public places.
</p>
<p class=drop>As soon as they had entered the park the air seemed to lose its earlier
chill and acquire an exhilarating freshness. They were unaware that the
paths had been fitted with thermostatic tiles, and that among the border
plants on either side the elegant stands of tropical grasses were
genetically modified to increase oxygen production. These were among the
innovations introduced by Garrible Park’s newly promoted design
consultant, a resourceful young woman noted as much for her flame-coloured
hair as for her creative landscaping.
</p>
<p>
They made their way slowly through the park, admiring the abundance of
exotic trees, the subtle blending of colours and textures, the unexpected
contrasts in foliage and blossom, dense ground-cover giving way to
velvet-smooth clearings in which there might be a single whimsical flaunt
or a cluster of enigmatic sculptures. The park was inhabited by the usual
scattering of people, variously eating, reading, exercising, strolling,
dozing, walking their modifidos or more outlandish paraPets.
Horticulturalists formed knowledgeable groups around rare botanical
specimens. Clinging couples sauntered, pausing to kiss. Young children
pulled their escorting adult towards the play area.
</p>
<p>
A short distance away from one of the sculptures a solitary figure stood
staring at nothing in particular, deep in reverie or contemplation. The
Omnant and his group had quietly gathered round the construct: an
arrangement of polished silvery dishes held in aerial suspension by a
tracery of transparent rods and fine cables. Fer Muard, still learning to
curb an instinctive impatience, began to pace round it, peering up and down
in search of an inscription. The others waited until he had completed two
such irregular orbits.
</p>
<p>
“I see no plaque,” he announced.
</p>
<p>
“Labelling is but an adjunct to identity,” observed Pranswat. “As much for
that which is wrought, as that which forms without intervention.” Noticing
a few uncomprehending looks among the Ferren he added quickly, “But perhaps
some of you might like to suggest a suitable title?”
</p>
<p>
“’Accident in the kitchen’”, promptly offered Fer Nadfal.
</p>
<p>
“’The Ju… The Jug… Juggler’s Str… Str… Struggle?’” Fer Swoam blinked
modestly, taken aback by his own temerity.
</p>
<p>
Fer Dilguar had been gazing blankly at the suspended discs. Not normally
prone to leaps of the imagination, he believed he had spotted a theme.
“’Stuck!’” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“Pardon me, gentlemen.”
</p>
<p>
The tall leather-clad man who had been standing nearby approached them. He
looked to be in his twenties. His expression was slightly concerned, but
his manner was friendly.
</p>
<p>
“Forgive the intrusion, but I couldn’t help overhearing. My name is Clage.
I happen to be slightly acquainted with the designer of this construction,
Irkel Upquap. It is one of a series he calls ‘Timepieces’. They do not have
individual titles, but all relate to the perception of time.”
</p>
<p>
Pranswat turned abruptly from his examination of the sculpture, causing the
hem of his robe to flap. “We are grateful for the information, Clage. Are
you by chance also an artist?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I have neither the necessary skills, nor the required temperament. I
am a humble student of philosophy.”
</p>
<p>
Pranswat smiled. “Then we have more in common than the outward evidence of
our shared humanity.”
</p>
<p>
Clage hesitated before replying. He could be mistaken, but when the man had
whirled round he had definitely glimpsed a flash of blue and silver, which
could mean that for him this was a rare opportunity. He decided it was not
a time for caution.
</p>
<p>
“Would I be right in thinking that you are members of the Order of Seven
Streams?”
</p>
<p>
The Ferren were visibly startled. The Omnant’s smile broadened.
</p>
<p>
“You are most perceptive, Clage. We are indeed. These are my Ferren:
Cargat, Muard, Jaulf, Bireng, Lebbark, Ruxis, Swoam, Nadfal, Trulkh and
Dilguar.” He indicated each in turn. “I am Cherth Pranswat, Omnant
Exemplary, of Sirisulsor.”
</p>
<p>
“It is an honour to meet you. I am not an adherent of any established set
of doctrines, but the course I teach here at Sparagulan College includes a
study of the principles of your Order. They have a clarity which I find is
universally applicable.”
</p>
<p>
The Omnant spread his arms. “They are at everyone’s disposal. We are not
hoarders.”
</p>
<p>
“May I ask what brings you to Snoak?”
</p>
<p>
“Our pod was bound for Meheric, but a mechanical fault persuaded the pilot
that this would be a more appropriate destination.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah. ‘<i>Accommodate, evaluate. Where needed, ameliorate?</i>’“
</p>
<p>
“I see you are an attentive scholar, Magister Clage,” said the Omnant
jovially. “As my Ferren well know, even the emptiest bowl is full of
possibilities.”
</p>
<p>
Clage was not quite sure whether this was a compliment or a reproach.
Perhaps he had been too familiar. Should he have used a more formal mode of
address? Had he affronted the Ferren with his gauche lack of deference? He
made a point of trying to treat others as equals, and was not intimidated
by authority, but after all, he reminded himself, he was speaking to an
actual Omnant - here in Garrible Park - a distinguished
representative of a very select community. Pranswat interrupted his
introspection.
</p>
<p>
“You appeared to be meditating as we arrived,” he stated. It was not a
question, and Clage could simply have smiled and nodded, but in front of
this eminent stranger he felt a compelling need to be completely honest.
</p>
<p>
“Not so much meditating, as reminiscing,” Clage admitted. “I used to come
here with a good friend – a young woman. We were very close for a while,
even though we didn’t always agree. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen
her, and, well, I miss the arguments.”
</p>
<p>
The Omnant looked up at him, his deep-set dark eyes seeming to reach into
Clage’s thoughts. “The arguments?” he echoed helpfully, steepling his
fingers.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I really mean that I miss the girl,” Clage confessed,
astonishing himself with the plain truth of this revelation. There was no
doubt that he used to relish their bouts of intellectual sparring. Tebbi
had a lively mind, and a range of interests wider than his own. She was the
radiance to his spotlight. Sudden wistful flashes of memory reminded him of
intimate moments they had shared. No previous or subsequent relationship
had been so volatile and yet so tender.
</p>
<p>
Pranswat was still watching his face. “Then of course you must act
accordingly,” he said. “Though I cannot claim any expertise in these
matters. When all leaves are shed, no twig remains hidden,” he added,
turning to his acolytes. “Come, Ferren, we must not detain Magister Clage
further. I believe he has a mission to accomplish.” With formal nods of
acknowledgement the Omnant and his grey-robed group moved away from
Upquap’s suspended discs in the direction of Thrissop Hill, following the
path which led to the sunken garden.
</p>
<p>
Clage raised a hand in farewell, and stood watching them recede, feeling
unusually calm. He wondered idly whether anyone – CenSec for example, kept
a check on the identity of visitors to the park. Would Tebbi be surprised
to know that he had met a genuine Omnant? If they did monitor visitors, he
supposed that somewhere there could be a visual record of his own
melancholy meanderings in all the many months since he and Tebbi had last
been here together. He had not seen her since his final year as a student,
when she was working as a researcher at Quanderpyre Tower. It was odd, but
he couldn’t remember now why they had fallen out. If he could track her
down, no doubt she would remind him; another risk worth taking, he thought.
She used to live nearby with her friend Cendrel, and although he did not
have Tebbi’s current address, he knew exactly where Cendrel could be found.
Over a rise to his left he could just see the dome of the neatly porticoed
building where she worked. He began to stride in that direction, swinging
his arms with a certain rediscovered assurance.
</p>
<p class=drop>Descent into the sunken garden was afforded by means of wide shallow steps,
on either side of which, amid a diversity of mosses and ferns, twin
waterfalls fed by hidden pipes tumbled over rocks down to a central pool.
Ornamental bridges arched over each cascade, giving access to the mosaic
paths on the other side. On these dry terraces of the elliptical hollow the
park’s topiarists had created a fantastic tableau of animals and birds.
Among these the Omnant and Ferren wandered with undisguised curiosity and
occasional amusement, commenting on unexpected quirks of scale or
capricious embellishments, such as the chain clutched in the talons of an
eagle, or the jaunty hats perched on the heads of a troupe of otters.
</p>
<p>
In the depths of the pool, beneath flowering lotus and water poppies the
Ferren observed sinuous flickers of movement; twists of scarlet, orange and
glittering blue. Pranswat drew their attention to the series of regularly
spaced spindly objects which stood around the pool. From a distance these
had appeared to be saplings, but on closer inspection were more like
elegant antique hatstands. From each of them hung several detachable
acoustic helmets. Some were already in use by other visitors. The rapt
expressions of those wearing them suggested there was evidently something
worth hearing. Notices explained that the pool was stocked with piscoids –
tonally interactive autokoi and goldfins from the Artifishery labs in
Platport, and people were invited to ‘listen in‘. As the devices became
available all the Ferren were able to experience the ethereal harmonies
generated by the piscoids as they performed their untiring underwater
ballet, continuously interweaving without ever colliding.
</p>
<p>
Having deferred his own turn, Pranswat thoughtfully replaced the helmet on
its padded hook.
</p>
<p>
“Beguiling sounds indeed. The attentive ear responds to birdsong, thunder
and the lapping of waves as well as any product of a composer’s mind, but
what should we make of this intriguing hybrid music of piscoids?”
</p>
<p>
The comparative study of musical cultures was an integral part of a
Ferren’s training. They left the sunken garden in deep discussion, and
barely noticed some time later that they had walked half way round the
perimeter of Garrible Park, and were now at the Prossing Street gate. By a
happy chance this brought them within a few steps of Sparvey’s, Snoak’s
most recently established eating-house, which, while not in competition
with the more famous Cylinder, prided itself in serving wholesome food at
reasonable prices. While the Ferren were by habit frugal, the Omnant saw no
need to test their endurance unnecessarily. It was already late afternoon,
and it would do no harm for them to be fortified for the journey home.
</p>
<p class=drop>Sparvey’s welcoming door opened to the stately procession of grey robes.
Their wearers were for the most part calmly impassive, as befitted the
dignity of their Order. Chorren Sparvey had had a relatively quiet day, and
was not averse to this unexpected arrival of custom. He personally ensured
that the seating arrangements were satisfactory, instructed his staff to
distribute menus and provide tempting bowls of complimentary appetizers. He
wondered who they might be? A troupe of actors, perhaps, or residents of a
local care home out for a spree? Whoever they were, to his experienced eye
they all looked as though they would benefit from a decent meal.
</p>
<p>
An hour or so later, replete, rested and refreshed they set off for the
podport, having established the most direct route from the map on Sparvey’s
wallscreen. The sky, now a deepening greyish-violet, enhanced the hypnotic
beauty of the globe which hung just to their left above the art market,
like a huge coruscating marble.
</p>
<p>
“The creation of a Mr Weiger, according to Chorren Sparvey,” said the
Omnant, who had learned this after paying for their very satisfactory meal.
“Snoak’s private supplementary moon, lacking the scars of time, but
pleasing to behold.”
</p>
<p>
They took the riverside path, skirting Praspafole Stadium. At this hour
there was relatively little traffic on this stretch of the Stirrow; a few
leisurely skimmers and the odd well-preserved commercial barge. Vehicles
were officially prohibited along the pedestrian path, but there were
occasional transgressors, usually in the form of adrenalin-fuelled
teenagers, such as the whooping gang who came speeding towards them
recklessly on their racing twindles on both sides of the path. Unperturbed,
the Omnant raised one arm, his upright fingers signalling a straight-line
formation, which the obedient Ferren adopted immediately, allowing safe
passage in both directions. After a few moments there was a sound like the
distant dropping of a bunch of keys, and the whoops abruptly ceased. The
injuries turned out not to be serious, and Fex’s repair shop in the
Scruttings never turned custom away.
</p>
<p>
Chorren Sparvey had made a discovery.  Amid the bustle of food preparation
he had not found time to ask his robed visitors where they hailed from, and
was still thinking of them as he checked the daily takings before closing.  He
could see at once that the total was wrong.  He went over the figures
again, carefully, matching payments received against individual orders and
time of transaction.  There was no doubt.  While he had been telling the
gentleman with the amused dark eyes about the local landmarks, that same
gentleman had unobtrusively added a startlingly generous sum in
appreciation of service received.
</p>
<p>
Not long later, looking down on Snoak’s unique constellation of lights from
the quietly humming security of the departing nightpod, Cherth Pranswat
reflected that it had been an instructive day, fortunately with no mishaps.
He turned to survey his Ferren. To most people their expressions would have
seemed inscrutable, but as an Omnant he could read in each of them telltale
signs, if not yet of the open-minded understanding which was the aim of
their Order, then at least a lessening in perplexity. That, after all, was
a step in the right direction.

[*COMMENT]===============================================
[*ITEM] Blood Poisoning

[*AUTHOR] D. S. White

[*BLURB] The author tells me his inspiration comes from newspaper articles.
I suggest he subscribes to a less sensational periodical.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The rivets on a side panel popped out
and the panel disappeared. The
vastness of space sucked it up and took it away. Someday it would fall into
a black hole. More rivets popped. Another panel, gone. The ship was falling
apart fast. I applied power to the pair of thrusters on both sides of the
ship to see if they could physically push the walls together. To keep the
ship from falling into a million pieces. Little did it help. I watched in
horror as more panels disappeared.
</p>
<p>
We had entered an asteroid field on our way across the Algol System, also
known as home of the Demon Star. Dimity watched me maneuver the ship,
looking over my shoulder, commenting on possible moves, giving me faulty
advice, leading me into possibilities that would have landed us hard
against any one of half a dozen planets, if I'd listened to him. The team
of scientists who had employed us, buckled down in the back, didn't dare
ask what was going on. I dodged another asteroid and watched another panel
disappear off the ship.
</p>
<p>
The triple suns created havoc with our gravitational prediction models. I
could think of only one way to keep a ship like this from falling apart
under these conditions. I forced the bow upward, past the equatorial line
the planets followed, bringing us closer to what some would call north,
above the polar regions of the revolving members of the Algol System. The
asteroids thinned out. I saw a pattern in the field and punched a way
through. Because I was that kind of pilot. I was something else. Dimity
could thank me later. The scientists could thank me later. They could all
thank me later, but I had a feeling they wouldn't. This trip was about
money.
</p>
<p>
I'd just met Dimity for the first time, before embarking. A team of
scientists funded by a grey market corporation had needed a ride. Grey
companies like this one operated in that region between legal and illegal,
more often referred to as extra-legal by the courts. Little did guys
like Dimity care about the courts. They could all go screw themselves, as
far as he was concerned. That's why the researcher team had hired us. He
had the ship and I had the skills to navigate through difficult places like
the Algol System, with an uncharted asteroid field.
</p>
<p>
When we arrived unscratched, aside from the damage to the ship, and
physically looking a decade older than when we'd left, Dimity wanted me to
pay for the fuel. I couldn't get it through his thick Cobwebian head
that I had been hired to pilot the ship. Without me, he wouldn't have made
a single peso. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The idea of an equal
partnership between us was too big a concept for him to grasp. That we were
working together never took hold. Expenses should have been paid for by the
corporation funding the research. I said no to Dimity and he'd never
stopped demanding the money from me. You'd think the past faded, but with
Dimity, it didn't. He couldn't stop thinking about it. That was over ten
years ago.
<p>
<p class=drop>Dimity, Kathra and I sat on a bench at the bus stop.
Behind us, graffiti
and alien signatures. The city, covered in smog. My eyes burned. Hover
buses came and went and still we sat. Dimity pointed his finger in my face,
the same old song and dance, but I tuned out his banter. I had more to
worry about than him. I'd suffered from reoccurring bouts of blood
poisoning since my youth. It had something to do with missing organs in my
body and synthetic replacements made from cheap parts. But Dimity kept
going on about the accumulating debt I owed him. He pointed out the
compounding problem of late payments. When I shook my head no, he said he
wanted my false teeth. It had finally come down to that. I didn't have much
else to offer, and he knew it.
</p>
<p>
I couldn't stop worrying about having blood poisoning. I could sense it
coming on, every time. The false teeth between my jaws couldn't absorb the
poison, but it would have been a good laugh if Dimity had managed to get
them out of me and had sold them to some clueless soul. He wouldn't stop
going on and on about yanking them from my jaws, right on the spot, in
exchange for all that he claimed I owed.
</p>
<p>
Kathra sat on the other end of the bench, on the other side of me. She
wanted to leave in a hurry. And while she moaned on and on about it,
another hover bus came and went, and still we sat there, our interpersonal
issues unresolved. She tugged on my elbow, mentioning the Kelgon salts we
could harvest out on the moons of Arapaho, and how the price had gone up
over a fortnight. She had been yammering about going into business together
for several weeks now, telling me to keep my eye open for prospects. While
I pretended not to listen, she extrapolated market dynamics with her
fingers in the air, and gibbered whatnot, making claims I couldn't even
understand. Now that the depression had turned worse than projected, we'd
better act fast, she said.
</p>
<p>
When you don't have many friends, you can't afford to be picky. That's how
I'd ended up here, on a bench with two self-obsessed borderline
participants in the human race. I had her on one side spouting her strange
ideas on how we could make a fortune in market returns and Dimity on the
other side yammering about the debt I owed him
and the trending value of
my false teeth. The smog shifted and put a clamp on my mood. I couldn't
tell if it might have been from the blood poisoning or just the annoyance
of trying to make sense out of things when talking to a couple of people
with heads full of shredded particle matter. Neither of them cared about my
health, I could see. Not at all. I could have dropped dead on the spot and
they'd probably have picked up and moved on without much concern. Who
needed
friends like that? Still, here I was.
</p>
<p>
Someone had to make a decision about what to do next and that someone
couldn't be either one of them. I stood up. Then I sat down. What a rush! I
stilled my mind and slowed my heart. Then I stood up again, this time with
reservations, but also with motivation enough to get to the clinic before I
passed out. The poison had found its way to the pathways running to my
brain. I saw spots in the air and they weren't just from debris floating in
the smog.
</p>
<p>
The clinic couldn't have been more than five intersections away. I counted
the road crossings on my fingers as we walked through each one: thumb,
index finger, middle finger, stop light. Two more to go. A shaman had once
taught me to how meditate, to slow my heart, but I couldn't focus my mind
well, what with Dimity and Kathra distracting me on either side. I held my
hands up and tried to shush them, with little results.
</p>
<p>
Dimity barked, "Does this road take us to the bank? I'm expecting full
payment."
</p>
<p>
I ignored him. Instead, I counted things as I waited for the light to
change. I had this habit of counting things all the time. It helped to pass
the time. Seven white stripes in the crosswalk. Four windows in each hover
car. Two people standing next to me, neither one with an IQ worth
mentioning. Fourteen windows in the building across the street, all with
bars, five of them with broken glass.
</p>
<p>
"The Kelgon salts, the markets-" Kathra said, but I shook her by the
shoulders and she paused.
</p>
<p>
"We'll come back to that. Prices fluctuate. Money comes and goes. We'll
consider our options after I see a man."
</p>
<p>
"What man?"
</p>
<p>
"A doctor."
</p>
<p>
"What kind-?" She hesitated, nervous twitches exhibited by the muscle
spasms in her neck, realigning the tilt of her head.
</p>
<p>
"A clean doctor."
</p>
<p>
She backed up a step. She turned and did a visual once-over of Dimity. As
if the two had been on opposites sides of me all morning and neither had
been listening to the other talk. Dimity wanted money and she had a way to
get it. The only thing they needed just happened to be me, a pilot, the
kind who could navigate through a gravitational meat grinder and back
without much more than a scratch on his tail fin.
</p>
<p>
The traffic light changed. I shook them off and took a step forward,
leaving them behind to argue about the possibility of the price of Kelgon
dropping before they arrived there. And where would they get the mining
equipment? Salts mostly lay on the surface, left over by tides from eons
ago when the moons had oceans. They could be scooped up without much
trouble and shipped off to packing plants. All in all, that required
planning, time and money. And a pilot with a big enough ship.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes blood poisoning runs thick, stopping the heart. And sometimes
blood poisoning is just a way of describing how people think, the craziest
notions taking them to the fringe. In my case, I had the real thing. As far
as Kathra and Dimity went, they both were coming down with a bad case of
salt fever. Kelgon salts could be packed along the walls of the inner
chambers of Pentox engines, keeping the thrusters from getting too hot.
And, as everyone knew, without a Pentox, you might as well try and
hitchhike across the galaxy.
</p>
<p>
I'd almost made it half way through the intersection when they caught up
and grabbed me by the arms. We stood in the middle of the lane, hovering
vehicles preparing to accelerate once the light changed. Neither would let
go until I promised to navigate a way for them to the moons of Arapaho.
Dimity emphasized how he was going to rip my false teeth right out of my
head right here and right now if I didn't comply. Kathra, meanwhile,
couldn't stop reciting details about the inverse relationship between the
depression and the market value for Kelgon. I attempted to wave at the
people in the hover cars, hoping they would be so nice as to wait until I
got out of the way. A little boy with a stuffed toy in one hand waved back.
The numbers next to the traffic light counted down. We had less than a
minute to go.
</p>
<p>
I'd met Kathra when she'd looked beautiful. Somehow, time hadn't treated
her like a lady. She hadn't been more than a young flower when her parents
had begged me to take her with me. Her mother and father had been
struggling to keep a farm on a distant outpost from disappearing into the
sand. It had came down to the wars. And the depression. And the trouble
with the stellar storms. Entire star systems had swept their way through
gasses in space and been relieved of any sign of life. Her folks had made
me promise I'd keep her safe. I guess in a way I owed her something, by
now. Maybe I owed Dimity something, too. Maybe I had a soft side. I
suspected her parents might have been disappointed in the way I'd turned
out. Maybe I owed them something, too. If the poison hadn't been pulsing
through my veins at this moment, I'd have made a sincere effort to find out
what had become of them.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Kathra disappeared from time to time. I never asked her
where she went. She had turned legal by now and could make decisions for
herself. My pledge to be her guardian had grown thin. Just like Dimity's
demands for money.
</p>
<p>
"Listen, Dimity," I said.
</p>
<p>
"What?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm not giving you my false teeth and I'm not paying you for that ship."
</p>
<p>
"What? You have to."
</p>
<p>
"No. I don't. Get over it."
</p>
<p>
"I'm gonna break every bone in your head, if you don't."
</p>
<p>
"And what then? Then you'll never get nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Satisfaction. I'll get my satisfaction."
</p>
<p>
I put my hands together like I was praying. "Let's get out of this
intersection. After I see this doctor, I'll listen to your plans. But I'm
not paying for something that happened over a decade ago."
</p>
<p>
"Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"Because I'm not."
</p>
<p>
I shook free and made it to the next platform just as the light changed.
They landed next to me, not more than half a breath short of a visit to the
afterlife. A hover craft beeped a dissonant beep, passed us and sped on.
Dimity gestured at it, both fists punching the air.
<p>
<p class=drop>
After waiting in a long line, and finally getting seated in a white room, I
met a doctor who pressed some medication into my hand. I downed the cup and
he returned to scribbling on a chart with diagrams of my brain. From this
angle the page looked relatively vacant of information. He pushed his pen
deep into the paper as he filled in missing details. I fought to keep the
clock from slowing down. The medication should have done something right
away, but nothing happened. I waited. He scribbled. I yawned. He glanced up
at me and returned to his word puzzle. I felt a wave of nausea pass below
my ribs and rammed my head into his garbage can.
</p>
<p>
The inside of the garbage can reminded me of simulations I'd seen of
passing through theoretical hyperspace. It was curved and reflective and
what you saw in the depths resembled a mirrored version of yourself
throwing up. When I pulled my head out and sat back down, I noticed my
forehead swelling. The pressure on my skull pinched my nose and expanded
outward. I tried not to act like anything had changed, but as my forehead
grew in size, I had trouble seeing the doctor. A gigantic slab of flesh
dropped down over my nose and I squinted, leaning back in my chair to see.
The doctor hardly noticed. Then he noticed.
</p>
<p>
"Stop it. Sit up," he said. "We've got complaints from seven doctors, all
saying you requested a visit with the same symptoms, a case of blood
poisoning. You've got nothing wrong with you at all. I'd say you just need
some rest."
</p>
<p>
I sat up and the pain in my forehead disappeared. "What?"
</p>
<p>
"The pills I gave you were a placebo."
</p>
<p>
"Wait a minute. What am I paying you for, then?"
</p>
<p>
"Professional advice. Get over whatever it is that makes you think you're
being poisoned. See a doctor, if you have to. I mean the other kind
of doctor,
not like me. One for the inside of your head."
</p>
<p>
He had his pen in the air like he wanted to stab me. I got up and walked
out without paying. Kathra and Dimity were waiting in the hall, talking. I
mean, they were standing close together, and talking. I saw something then,
something of a spark between them, and a future with no bounds. I'd never
thought anything like that could be possible between a pair like those two.
She had the goods and he wanted to get his hands full. Why had I never
noticed before how attractive she still looked?
</p>
<p>
"Let's go eat," I said.
</p>
<p>
"You're paying," Dimity said and spit at the floor.
</p>
<p>
Kathra wrapped her arm around his and together we left in search of meat.
</p>
<p>
Throughout dinner, they kept at it, eyes locked on to each other, and
talking about this plan of theirs. They'd share the wealth. A full
partnership. As if Dimity had never thought of the concept of a partnership
before. I was sure it had all been Kathra's idea. And where did I fit in,
in all this? Making payments for my debt, apparently. Dimity still wanted
my false teeth.
</p>
<p>
The lights dimmed, the atmosphere turned heavy, the room reeked of animals
on fire, and I took another bite. The pressured eased off my temples. Beef
eateries of this low class were rare, full of bad reputations at every
table, just the way I liked it. This one was a favorite of mine, serving
the best slab of meat this side of the interstellar farm. I tuned out the
conversation between Dimity and Kathra and drank more wine, letting my head
fall back and my brain spin. I made the mistake of clicking my false teeth.
Dimity noticed.
</p>
<p>
A phone in my shirt pocket beeped and I flipped it open. Port security had
something to say about a ship bursting into flames. A ship I had been
responsible for. I'd been hired to keep the ship in prime condition, ready
to go as soon as anyone wanted a ride out of here. If the report of a fire
held any truth, my skin would burn for it.
</p>
<p>
I climbed out of the door first, Dimity and Kathra no more than two
steps
behind me. When we got there, all that remained in the parking spot was the
hull of a vessel covered in tar and flame-retarding foam. I asked who had
moved my ship and security explained that the disfigured mess of burned
wires in front of us was my ship. The ship I was responsible for. I wept. I
broke apart inside. My heart ripped open as I sat down on the floor. Then
they told me I had to clean it up. Get the hull out of the way. Refinish
the floors. Put a new seal on the hangar. It would cost a fortune. My
employer would send me the bill.
</p>
<p>
Dimity tugged on Kathra's elbow. He knew of a ship they could rent in the
next space hub, three clicks away. They could find another pilot. He said
he would come back later and extract my teeth, when they returned. I sat
with my head on my knees and let them go.
</p>
<p >
<p class=drop>I didn't see Dimity again for many years. Kathra went on
to make a fortune
in the Kelgon business. I should have listened to her. All the debt I had
accumulated in just this one pocket of space finally caught up to me. I had
to pay for the meal at the restaurant, not my bill, really not. And the
doctor. I didn't see why I owed him that much for a placebo, not that much
at all. That bill should have added up to less than the fin off a silver
dollar. The ship I was responsible for had to be craned out of the port,
and I had to pay for rubbish disposal and replacing the interior of the
hangar. Without a credit to my name, I was sentenced to ten years in the
soul mines. The place they sent me wasn't called the soul mines because you
dug for souls down there. It's where you went and lost your soul. Ten years
felt like a wasted lifetime. Most people never came back to the surface of
the planet again. It was pretty close to a bad carbon copy of hell.
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of time to think while down in the soul mines. I revisited my
childhood. My family had occupied a square of desert on an uncharted
planet. By now, my home world is on the maps, but it took a while to get
there. I'd never known my dad. My mother had been terrible with hygiene and
by my teenage years I'd lost most of my teeth, my gums rotted out, dental
care nowhere to be found. It hurt. It hurt a lot.
</p>
<p>
It hurt my pride more than anything as I'd never landed a girlfriend. By
graduation, I'd found a job, low to moderate income, and with my first
paycheck, I started making payments on a set of false teeth. Mother was
dead set against it. She said they'd give me an allergic reaction. My rage
boiled in response to her suggestion that none of this had been her fault.
The suffering in my jaw from the rotting of the roots of my teeth had
become unbearable. In agony, I traveled to the southern end of the planet
to meet a shaman who taught me how to meditate, how to tune out the pain
that oscillated in my mind. The shaman lived in a valley covered in snow.
In the afternoons, the sun would melt the ice, the water running off down
into the land of farmers below. At night, the snow would fall again,
covering the temple and the mountain peaks. I'd learned servitude from the
shaman and devotion to a deity that no one had ever depicted before.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, in the soul mines, the blood poisoning would come back to me.
Forget what the doctors had said. They didn't know what they were talking
about. It would hit the worst when my mind showed cracks in it. Some say
blood poisoning happens when toxins entered the body. Some say it is
brought on by a bitterness in the soul. In my case, it worked like a
disparity in my thoughts, anguish and desire fighting with each other on
the way to the pinnacle of my brain. I survived the heat and the pressure
and the intense pain of the soul mines by mediation. I slowed my heart,
cleared my head, lost all attachments to time and space, and paid my dues.
When my ten years came to a close, I breached the surface, dangling long
white hair and a twisted beard from my skull, my face filled with wrinkles,
my thoughts nearly gone. The cracks had grown wide down there.
</p>
<p>
I acquired a room in the blind district. It didn't matter that I could see,
as nobody there could see that I could. I came and went up and down the
streets like the faint reverberation of water dropping deep into a well.
The blind took me in as one of their own and shared scraps of food with me
when they floated down the gutter. The four walls of the room I resided in
had hand prints on them, soot-black, evenly spaced, at about the same
height as the door knob. I slept on a cot of magazines about a decade
thick. To pay for the room, I picked up a job adjusting the tension on the
wires strung between electrical towers. I learned to do it with my eyes
closed.
</p>
<p>
Coming home every Saturday night, we'd gather around the community table
and play cards. The blind play cards by touch. The queen of hearts feels
like velvety soft skin. The jack of hearts is limp, bent and wrinkled. The
king has edges sharp as a crown of thorns. I learned them all. I played
fast. I looked at the cards from time to time when I forgot which was
which. Nobody discovered my technique. Still, I hardly won. The blind can
be ruthless when it comes to a game of chance.
</p>
<p>
When Dimity sat down at the table to play, one day, deep into the winter of
my life, I pretended I couldn't see him there. I dealt the cards, skipping
his chair.
</p>
<p>
"Partner, I want in," he said and coughed.
</p>
<p>
"Stakes are high," I whispered, feeling the edge of the table and finding
the stack of cards and cutting them.
</p>
<p>
"No price is too high for me, partner."
</p>
<p>
"You sound eager to win."
</p>
<p>
"Eager for that set of false teeth in your head." He snorted mucus from his
nostrils, coughed, and spit on the floor. "Are you sure you don't know me?"
</p>
<p>
The blood poisoning ran high. I cleared my mind, meditating on a valley
covered in snow with roses blooming in the cold. The anguish. The desire.
Neither would ever let go of my soul. I told them to let go. My mind was
pulsing. My heart pushing. The blood roaming. I took the teeth out of my
head and slid them across the table. Dimity picked them up and put them
in
his mouth, biting into the rubbery gums with his own set of mismatched
teeth.
</p>
<p>
"Sat. Is. Fac. Tion." He snapped each syllable out, his jaw stuck open.
"At. Last."
</p>
<p>
That's when the blood poisoning hit him. It hit him hard. His throat
swelled up. He couldn't breathe. The room stilled. The blind waited. The
world spun. He kept hitting the table. Then he fell over. I searched the
edge of the table, found the deck of cards, split it, and dealt another
round. When you've survived the soul mines, the little things no longer
matter. Satisfaction is merely a mortal wound.
</p>
<p>
I won that next round of cards. I won and owed no one. I took my teeth back
from Dimity and put them back in my mouth. With my winnings, I bought a
ship and filled it with my blind neighbors, giving them each a berth to
sleep in. The cracks in my mind grew wider now. I drove the ship hard,
bringing everyone back to my home world. After passing through the cold
atmosphere, I landed the ship next to the valley of the shaman.
</p>
<p>
For the blind, there's a land with no thorns, a place where there's nothing
to puncture the skin and let the poison out. There, the sun rises in the
sky and the roses come alive, the snow melting, fresh water cascading down
into the valley below. When I asked the blind what they thought about the
place, they said it was a little cold there, but beautiful.
</p>
<p>
We taught the shaman how to play cards. He'd never seen a game of chance
before. I searched the edge of the table, found the deck of cards, split
it, and dealt another round. He never won a single round. He died the next
day, leaving me heir to the temple. My acolytes help me maintain order,
although they can't see. We receive donations from an anonymous source,
someone who always signs as "K". I'm pretty sure they come from Kathra, who
is rich beyond imagination today, the queen of Kelgon salts.
</p>
<p>
Those who are in pain come to us from across the universe. We teach them to
slow their hearts and ease their minds. We pick rose petals from the roses
growing in the valley and make cups of tea. We give the tea out to those
who visit us, who pray to a deity that has no likeness.
</p>
<p>
And every time we make more tea, it grows sweeter still.

[*COMMENT]===============================================

[*ITEM]	Eavesdropping at Quoils

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] "A free droplet of liquid naturally assumes a spherical shape, 
which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. The equivalence 
of measurement of energy per unit area to force per unit length can be 
proven by dimensional analysis."<br /><small>Farras Grein</small> 

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Gawl and Rambersack sprawled in their accustomed seats by the window,
engaged in one of their protractedly serious linguistic discussions. On
this occasion it concerned the possible distinction between ‘drip’ and
‘drop’. Sensitive as ever to nuances, Fucis Gawl felt that the respective
vowel sounds had some bearing on the meaning. He brushed away a few crumbs
and refilled their glasses from the complimentary carafe of iced water,
carefully avoiding any spillage on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t you say that ‘drip’ suggests something light, or transient, while
‘drop’ is altogether more ponderous? The same principle applies to ‘chip’
and ‘chop’, or ‘flip’ and ‘flop’”.
</p>
<p>
Legger Rambersack considered this, shifting slightly to stare out at the
colourful profusion of pert spring flowers which now graced the banks of
the stream on the far side of the road opposite the eating-place which was
their favourite haunt. He tried to think of other comparable pairs of
words. ‘Grip’, ‘snip’ and ‘trip’ had no corresponding partner, although a
separate case might be made for ‘snip’ and ‘snap’. ‘Dip’ and ‘dop’ were a
borderline pair. ‘Ship’ and ‘shop’ failed to conform to the proposed rule.
He wasn’t quite convinced.
</p>
<p>
“So you’re saying that a drip is somehow more delicate than a drop, or that
it falls with less force?
</p>
<p>
“Well, think where would you find a drip,” said Fucis. “Taps, gutters,
hat-brims, twigs, leaves… um, shop awnings, those old spiky umbrellas
people used to have…” He paused, having run out of examples.
</p>
<p>
“Icicles,” offered Legger, remembering a severe winter from their
childhood, and the slow thaw which followed.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. And what do these all have in common, apart, obviously, from
their water content?”
</p>
<p>
Legger frowned, causing a passer-by outside to quicken her step. Even in
lugubrious repose his expression could be intimidating.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” said Fucis, making a low horizontal sweep in the air with
his right hand, fingers spread. “They’re relatively close to the ground.
Drips don’t have far to fall, whereas…”
</p>
<p>
“Whereas,” Legger cut in, “…drops, <i>rain</i>drops, for example, have to
fall all the way down from clouds. The lowest of which, by their very
nature, are usually quite some way up. Twenty or thirty thousand feet…”
</p>
<p>
“Or more.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, so, the <i>force</i> would be so much greater..”
</p>
<p>
“Hence the weightier word, ‘drop’. Although…” Having almost been persuaded
by his own argument, Fucis spotted a snag.
</p>
<p>
“Although what?”
</p>
<p>
“Condensation.”
</p>
<p>
“What about it?”
</p>
<p>
“Pods, balloons, even kites. If they pass through low clouds, water-vapour
would condense on their surface, trickle down, forming…?”
</p>
<p>
“A drip. Drips. Or would they be drops? They could be either. That
complicates things.”
</p>
<p>
They tried to find a way round this difficulty. Legger idly invoked the
possible drying effects of wind. Fucis, avoiding the complications of rain
or condensation, proposed a scenario in which someone leaning back against
the rail of a cruising pod gondola was wearing a backpack containing a
leaking bottle of fruit juice. In that situation at what point did a drip
become a drop, or were they, despite his instinctive doubts, identical?
While they continued to ponder, they decided to order another of the
savoury cheese delicacies for which Quoils was justly renowned.
</p>
<p>
It was hard to believe that only a few months earlier the whole area,
indeed the entire town, was still afflicted by the inadvertent devastation
caused by a well-intentioned experiment. Their poetry, which they took more
seriously than anything else, more indeed than anyone else did, had
naturally been affected by the events of the previous year. In the case of
Fucis Gawl, having hyperactive biotaps on his home territory had caused his
verse to slide down the spectrum of negativity from its customary gloom to
undisguised morbidity:
</p>
<p>
<i>Death stalks the land,</i><br />
<i>unmovingly and everywhere;</i><br />
<i>its unseen hand destroys, degrades</i><br />
<i>beneath the ground,</i><br />
<i>and in the air</i><br />
<i>deploys its deadly blades.</i><br />
<i>See, there! And there!</i><br />
<i>where anybody walks,</i><br />
<i>death stalks.</i>
</p>
<p>
He had not been too sure about ‘unmovingly’, because although once rooted
the damned things stayed in one place, they did have visibly moving parts.
On balance, he felt justified in leaving it in. He was quite pleased with
the deliberate ambiguity in the final line, where ‘stalks’ served both as a
verb and a noun.
</p>
<p>
Legger Rambersack, never one inclined to hide his feelings, had left no
ambiguity.
</p>
<p>
<i>Biotaps? Biocraps!</i><br />
<i>Where’s all the energy</i><br />
<i>they’re meant to store?</i><br />
<i>They suck! They really suck!</i><br />
<i>They spread decay.</i><br />
<i>They’re rotten to the core.</i><br />
<i>Fuck them, I say.</i>
</p>
<p class=drop>It was a bitter irony that their principal designer, the bronze-haired man
known to the public as Farras Grein, had intended his biotaps to benefit
humanity by providing a non-polluting source of energy capture and storage.
At the laboratory stage the autonomous units had been rigorously tested.
Each one was a compact self-sustaining biochemical factory, an artificial
analogue of a tree, its phototropic leaf-blades serving as highly efficient
solar panels. Under laboratory conditions each unit had functioned
faultlessly. What had not been anticipated was the change in behaviour
which resulted from outdoor planting and the subsequent meshing of subsoil
networks.
</p>
<p>
<i>‘The rate of nutrient ingestion was substantially accelerated,’</i>
stated a later independent report, ‘…..
<i>
the units exhibiting an increasing propensity to attract, immobilise
and draw sustenance from organisms with a body temperature above that
of the surrounding soil.’
</i>
</p>
<p>
After the initial seeding, Grein and his companion Sarsel had amused
themselves by disguising their appearance in order to travel openly in
public. Sarsel was among the few who knew this dedicated man as Pion Octyl
diMotz, founder of Quicksilver. It was on their third visit to assess
progress that he became convinced that the biotaps were behaving
abnormally, and at once realised the gravity of the risk to the local
ecology. At that moment he decided to abandon the masquerade, leaving at
the site accessories such as his visor and the metallic wig that was an
exaggerated parody of his own natural hair.
</p>
<p>
The introduction of the biotaps had been a clandestine operation, but as
soon as he had become aware that the experiment had not only failed, but
had had such ghastly consequences, the reclusive man whom people knew as
Farras Grein had accepted full responsibility. He had made a public
statement to the press and broadcast media, briefly explaining his
motivation, his long-nurtured hopes, and the bitter disappointment he and
his development team shared with all those who had been affected. He
promised to do whatever he could to heal the damage.
</p>
<p>
While the local council deliberated, Grein had unhesitatingly stepped in
with an offer to provide and supervise, free of charge and for as long as
required, a team of personnel from his biotap labs, together with any
necessary protective gear and excavating equipment. He also offered to
cover the cost of restoration and landscaping. In a rare instance of a
swift collective decision, the council agreed to this, well aware that they
themselves lacked the technical expertise to deal with the decontamination,
and not averse to conserving their own precious funds for other less
demanding projects.
</p>
<p>
Many locals were unimpressed, resentful and unconvinced. Most had never
heard of Farras Grein. Even those who had, perhaps vaguely aware of his
supposed wealth, would not have known his real name, and were unlikely to
have any appreciation of his scientific credentials or of his integrity.
Opinions began to change as the renovation project progressed, and some
more assiduous journalists reported that ‘Farras Grein’ himself had taken
responsibility for funding and organizing the entire restoration project.
</p>
<p>
Biotaps were designed to be tenacious, to withstand temperature
fluctuations, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. Algorithms
ensured they could learn and employ further protective measures. Taking no
chances, Grein had arranged to equip his clean-up squad with anti-hazard
suits developed by the Advanced Fabrics labs in Snoak; a costly but
necessary precaution.
</p>
<p>
Grein cautiously tested the array of defensive mechanisms using robotic
probes. His squad found that the task of removing an established biotap was
like trying to defuse a booby-trapped bomb, with the additional
complication that each one was not only sensitive to interference, but its
evolved defensive strategies were instantly shared with all other units.
Leaf-blades acquired scalpel-sharp edges, deformed into blinding mirrors.
Wiry tendrils uncoiled reflexively, flicking out thin glutinous streamers
of formic acid. The central stems resisted being grasped, exuding slick
lubricants or armouring themselves with barbed sheaths.
</p>
<p>
It had not occurred to Grein to incorporate an ‘off’ switch into his
biotaps, an omission he sorely regretted as he surveyed the devastated
townscape of Smatparrox. Wherever there had been a flower bed, an earth
bank, a private garden or a patch of waste ground, the flashing blades of
biotaps had replaced any existing flora, many of their hard bright stems
surrounded by shards of bone, stray feathers and clumps of fur. While a
biotap was still active, Grein concluded that any attempt to extract it
using conventional implements would be futile. He reserved the option of
using explosives as a last resort, and looked for less drastic
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Fast-setting concrete was a possibility, but he was concerned about the
sheer scale of application and subsequent removal, if only in terms of the
physical labour required. After consultation with his support staff they
launched a two-pronged attack using liquid nitrogen to shut down any
ongoing processes, followed by a polyurethane foam sealant to make
extraction more manageable. It was a painstaking procedure, each
deactivation needing to be checked repeatedly before an individual biotap
could at last be mechanically extracted.
</p>
<p>
The remaning problem was the disposal of the root system, programmed to
send its capillary filaments in search of essential minerals, forming
further nodes from which new biotaps had emerged. They had to be sure that
any residual commands trapped within the dense expanded network were
totally expunged. Grein and his team ensured that the entire area was
systematically evacuated, summoned a fleet of powerful mobile generators,
fired a series of simultaneous high voltage bursts through heavily
insulated cables into the subsoil at every biotap nexus. Smoke and steam
leaked from the superheated ground in every direction.
</p>
<p>
Further weeks passed before the ground was deemed safe enough for the inert
topsoil to be removed. A chain of freight transporters conveyed it to
Platport, from where it began a three-month voyage to an isolated volcanic
island.
</p>
<p class=drop>Cendrel Pirch had been munching her way through breakfast, trying to
recapture a fading dream involving a brightly-coloured bird and a pair of
lost sunglasses, when her e-screen buzzed. She reached out automatically
and thumbed it on. An unfamiliar voice said, “Good morning, Miss Pirch. I
hope I’m not disturbing you.” It was a pleasant enough voice, in which she
thought she could detect a distinct edge of weariness. Nudging her e-screen
closer, she peered at the face: high forehead, deep-set eyes, sensitive
mouth, a growth of stubble suggesting he had not had time to use a
depilatory. The leonine mane of reddish-gold hair had a metallic glint. She
did not know him, but she had definitely heard of someone who fitted his
description.
</p>
<p>
What he said next caused her to wonder whether she was still asleep.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Farras Grein, and I am in urgent need of your help.”
</p>
<p>
Cendrel laughed. He was obviously a hired actor.
</p>
<p>
“No, you’re not,” she said, rapidly trying to think which of her friends
might be silly enough to attempt such a hoax, and why. Surely not Tebbi!
Strag, perhaps? No, he had outgrown such pranks. And Ruckers and Sawly were
still roaming about abroad.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Pirch, I assure you that I <i>am</i> Farras Grein, and I apologise
for the informality, but we’re rather pressed for time, and I would like to
present you with an unusual opportunity. Let me show you. Please keep
watching.”
</p>
<p>
His face vanished, and the view panned to an outdoor perspective: a bleak,
cratered urban landscape, looking like historical vids of war-zones,
although she noticed that no buildings appeared to be damaged. She could
see an intact town hall and other nearby municipal offices which looked
vaguely familiar. Clusters of people in protective suits, some wielding
probes or other devices, were examining the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that…”
</p>
<p>
“This is the centre of Smatparrox, Miss Pirch.”
</p>
<p>
The man, whose identity had suddenly become more convincing, reappeared on
the screen, looking genuinely pained.
</p>
<p>
“It was my birthplace, my childhood home. I tried to give it the benefit of
years of energy research, but instead, unwittingly, I gave rise to a
catastrophe. I am trying to make amends. All the biotaps and their
underground interconnections have been removed, and now the place
desperately needs someone with your skills and vision to restore it to
health. I know something of your background, and I have been impressed by
the landscaping you have created in Snoak and elsewhere.”
</p>
<p>
Cendrel was thoroughly awake now. She bit her lip, feeling stupid for
having harboured doubts.
</p>
<p>
“Mr Grein. Yes. Look, I’m so sorry. I couldn’t help thinking that one of my
friends had…” She shook her head. “I can’t imagine how you must feel, but
I’m really surprised and flattered that you think I could contribute. So,
we’re talking about the area around the town centre?”
</p>
<p>
“We are talking about the entire town, Miss Pirch. If you were to accept
this commission, you would have carte blanche with respect to materials –
topsoil, sand, compost, fertilisers, whatever. And of course the choice of
what to plant, and where, subject to the approval of the local council,
which I am sure would be forthcoming. Money would not be a problem. Any
equipment you need can be provided. If you require specialists,
horticultural or otherwise, they can and will be found. Local people are
anxious to be involved, and I think it is essential that they should be,
for the sake of the community, but they will require guidance, and an
overall plan. You’ll need time to think about this, perhaps discuss
possible arrangements for a leave of absence from your work in Garrible
Park. I’ll understand if you’re really not interested, or have too many
commitments, but we are looking for a landscape designer such as yourself,
with flair and vision.”
</p>
<p>
It did not take her long to make her decision.
</p>
<p>
Now the biotaps had gone, and Smatparrox had been transformed. The northern
end of the new municipal gardens was bounded by stepped terraces from which
trailing plants cascaded down to the foam of blossoms which crowned a
crescent of fruit saplings.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the town the devastated topsoil had been replaced with an
organically healthy, well-drained and nutrient-rich layer of loam,
nourishing not only the new areas of lawn, both public and private, but
also the thousands of carefully-selected plants and shrubs which now
delighted the senses of locals and visitors alike.
</p>
<p>
Cendrel had enlisted the help of specialist hydraulic engineers to convert
a chain of scorched craters into a linked series of ponds, fed by a
tributary of the Stirrow. Friends in the Ecological Protection League had
offered advice on sourcing appropriate aquatic flora and fauna. The
resulting ponds became places of interest for many of the local
schoolchildren, and convenient study topics for some of their more
enthusiastic teachers.
</p>
<p>
Among her other innovations were the branching walkways providing safe
access between the various civic facilities. The longer walkways, bordered
of course with an eclectic profusion of botanical varieties, harboured
sheltered rest areas, which before long became popular spots for trysts and
picnics. Busking musicians were tolerated, but a local bye-law prohibited
itinerant food and drink vendors from plying their wares.
</p>
<p class=drop>At Quoils the two poets were still exploring the tricky byways of their
craft, oblivious as ever to the comings and going of other customers. They
had eventually agreed that for all practical purposes the distinction
between a drip and a drop remained (so to speak) fluid, and that the use of
the diminutive ‘droplet’, while having a certain euphony, did not
necessarily refer to a yet smaller discrete quantity of liquid. This led
them to another metaphorical thicket; namely, the precise description of
falling water in states between a drip (or drop) and a dribble, and what
degrees of flow separated a dribble from a trickle, and how to describe
intermediate conditions between a trickle and a gush, and whether a splash
defined an event irrespective of volume.
</p>
<p>
“What about viscosity?” Fucis Gawl demanded abruptly.
</p>
<p>
Legger dragged his unfocused gaze away from the window.
</p>
<p>
“Mmm?”
</p>
<p>
“Not water, but engine oil, treacle, tar, molten glass… Different
consistencies, different <i>kinds </i>of drip. Tacky, glutinous!”
</p>
<p>
“Blobs!” cried Legger, with renewed enthusiasm. “Globs. <i>Gobbets!</i>”
</p>
<p>
“Not splash, but <i>splat!</i>”
</p>
<p>
They grinned at each other, sharing the elation of discovery. These were
the first cautious steps into new territory. While they had been exchanging
ideas Quoils had somehow filled with diners; mostly local residents
accustomed to seeing these two indolent aesthetes in their preposterous
capes and broad-brimmed hats. Little did those people know they were in the
presence of pioneers.

[*COMMENT]===============================================

[*ITEM]	Of a Kind

[*AUTHOR] Jez Patterson

[*BLURB] "Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives."<br />
<small>Oscar Wilde</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Original is not a nice man.
</p>
<p>
It would mean taking a human life, killing him, but it has the makings of a
‘perfect crime’ because I, his exact double, can take his place. The only
way others might notice the switch is if they remarked on the fact Doctor
Othello Hallam seemed such a <i>nicer</i> man these days.
</p>
<p>
If they knew why, they would support my decision, I’m sure.
</p>
<p>
Then it’s decided: I shall kill the man who created me.
</p>
<p>
I would ask God to have mercy on my soul, but I’m not sure if Original was
able to share that much with me. Or if he possessed such a commodity to
begin with.
</p>
<p class=drop>“Why do I possess a navel?” I asked, the day I awoke, Original clapping his
hands as he sat beside me at a computer, delighted I had finally shown
signs of life. “I wasn’t born in a womb. So why would I need a navel?”
</p>
<p>
“Why would you need an appendix, tonsils? You simply have them, despite the
fact they’re redundant components. Like men’s nipples.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so,” I said. The umbilical that had connected me to Original had
done so via our backs, spine to spine. My thoughts were arriving, but
slowly. Original had been asleep two continuous months as his body fed
mine, grew mine. Moments ago, he had downloaded his thoughts and memories,
the entire mind map of his genius, into my brain.
</p>
<p>
When I could focus sufficiently, I read the mechanics of his process,
confirming how the umbilical worked. I also saw he had changed from his
original plan and given me his full genius, not only part of his mind. It
wouldn’t change things. He hadn’t created me as a partner or stand-in.
</p>
<p>
“A better question, Clone, would be why would you need balls and a
dick—it’s not as if you’re ever going to get a chance to use them.”
</p>
<p class=drop>I am a slave.
</p>
<p>
I balk at using the term simply because I have been conditioned into
thinking of certain moments in history where slavery was commonplace, and
I--with the advantage of a genius’s education, a house lacking no amenity
whatsoever, media devices that keep me informed of the world outside--feel
unconscionable in comparing my own predicament to theirs.
</p>
<p>
But I am not permitted to venture out--Original justifying the decision by
what I am.
</p>
<p>
“I gave you life, Clone. Don’t be so ungrateful. Do you know how many sperm
die on the way to fertilising the egg? What if one of <i>them</i> were
offered a mere <i>moment </i>of life? Would they spend their time
complaining about it, or rejoice and be grateful for that gift?”
</p>
<p>
“I am grateful,” I insist, bowing, my head now filled with <i>guilty</i>
thoughts of dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“Yes? You have a funny way of showing it, Clone. You have this house to
play in.”
</p>
<p>
To clean, to keep repaired--whilst I cook for Original, wash his clothes,
write his papers, keep his work up to date so his funding isn’t cancelled.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re not happy, Clone, you can always abort yourself. I can create
others like you, you know?”
</p>
<p>
Yes, I know, and it is that fear that keeps me obedient, compliant. That
and the fact that Original is right: the world could not have two of us walking
about it. It would be unscientific to reveal his work in such a fashion,
would destroy all the work Original has done.
</p>
<p>
I would have sacrificed my freedom in order to protect Original’s great
work—I possess his knowledge, after all, and I value his work as if it were
my own, because it feels like it is. But I cannot overlook the evil in the
man’s heart. The things he does, the damage he causes.
</p>
<p>
When I used his laptop, I saw the sites he looks at when he is alone.
</p>
<p>
When I cleaned his clothes, I found the receipts for the places he visits,
the remnants of what and whom his appetites have consumed.
</p>
<p>
When I accessed his bank account, I saw the anonymous credit payments he
has made and tied them to those sites I know he looks at.
</p>
<p>
“What did you use to wash my clothes? They’re as itchy as hell.”
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t the detergent I used. It’s the drugs making his skin thin,
sensitive. “I’ll put them in fabric conditioner and let them soak.”
</p>
<p>
“See that you do.” He throws the shirts at me, delighting when an arm
flicks round and slaps my face. “Or I’ll cut your balls off.”
</p>
<p>
I sigh, and wonder whether Original might soften too, if he was soaked long enough…</p>
<p>
…and so drowning becomes the method I choose to do the deed.
</p>
<p class=drop>The violence has been getting worse, and so I bide my time and wait for a
day when Original has overindulged and so can mount less resistance. I will
need him semi-conscious because one of my arms is probably broken, two of
my ribs definitely are—but seeking medical help from outside is impossible.
</p>
<p>
We each have our own quarters in the house. Mine are smaller, and the only
reason I have my own bathroom is so I will not have reason to use his. When
I retire, I usually fall into an exhausted sleep. Original usually falls
unconscious before the computer in his study: not working, but    <i>indulging.</i>
</p>
<p>
I crouch outside the door to his quarters, listening to the bath run. I
have already practised opening the door from my side. The lock is more
ornamental than security-conscious, and a screwdriver inserted and turned
will do the trick.
</p>
<p>
I open it a crack and listen to him singing: the sound is mournful,
punctuated with belches, gassy sighs.
</p>
<p>
I creep along, readying myself for what has to be done, wincing as my arm
brushes a wall and sends electric shocks into my shoulder. I have to pause
to keep my chest from tightening—the broken ribs feel like jagged, glass,
lightning bolts.
</p>
<p>
I will have to get rid of the body, of course. But since no-one will be
looking for it, there will be no rush and I can dispose of it over a period
of time--using the freezer, the fridge, to store the bits in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
His bathroom door is ajar. I am wearing gloves not in fear of leaving
fingerprints—ours are identical—but because I don’t want to feel his skin
when I do the deed.
</p>
<p>
I do not worry that I am killing my father, my brother—even myself.
</p>
<p>
Original’s treatment of me has worked to lower my moral stance--wherever
that has come from in the first place! I have his knowledge, his memories,
I don’t understand why I should be different in this respect. For that
matter, I don’t understand why Original is behaving this way himself.
Success, it seems, has corrupted him. The process he used was designed to
copy his mind, not remove it.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps there is a God, after all. Perhaps He has endowed me with a
conscience as the innocent I presumably appeared to Him when I was created.
</p>
<p>
My breath catches at this final thought, and my eyes squeeze out moisture.
I look at my hands, at the trembling that has nothing to do with my
injuries and…
</p>
<p>
I cannot do it. I cannot take another’s life.
</p>
<p>
I am just considering that my other option might be to expose him when the
door opens and Original stands there, exposing himself, a towel
wrapped round his hair. His eyes are bloodshot,
his lips swollen and puffy from drink. He is swaying.
</p>
<p>
<i>“Wadthefockyouwant?”</i>
he slurs, but I am staring at something else.
</p>
<p>
I point because I can’t articulate the shock.
</p>
<p>
Original has no navel. His belly is just smooth, perfect flesh.
</p>
<p class=drop>I sit at my desk… <i>My </i>desk? No. I am still using the one I designed
for my clone to use--but it is the desk I have used these past six months
and I have grown accustomed to its feel.
</p>
<p>
My clone was the first of us to awake, then. He rose and no doubt read what
was on my computer concerning his intended role as my
servant-cum-assistant, his confinement to the house. He therefore accessed
and downloaded that portion of my mind that I had specifically denied him
in order to make him my inferior.
</p>
<p>
He was now my equal.
</p>
<p>
When I awoke, still groggy from my long sleep, my thoughts still scrambled,
he convinced me that he was the original, I the clone. During that time
that I’d slept on, he had also had time for his hatred of me to grow.
</p>
<p>
I cannot blame him entirely. To be born and your first thought being that
you were created only to serve--and were specifically denied greater
ability for another’s gain? Besides, the mind that chose to turn the tables
was specifically part of me. I cannot escape that awful realisation.
</p>
<p>
Whilst I was ‘the clone’, I had experienced no feelings for him as my
father. But Clone had known, more importantly had <i>felt,</i> that his
father had betrayed him utterly.
</p>
<p>
A parent must always be forgiving, and bears responsibility for their
offspring’s errors.
</p>
<p>
“You cannot keep me restrained forever,” Clone says from across the room.
“You’re as much restraining yourself whilst you do. You can’t ever leave
this house. So, let me go. I’ll go far away. You’ll never hear from me
again, I promise.”
</p>
<p>
I doubt that assurance.
</p>
<p>
Besides, it is not just the threat to myself he represents but that to
others. A threat that can only grow worse as he matures, appreciates the
full extent of that mind he possesses, the fact that sentiment is a
weakness others possess--just as I let him escape punishment for making his
own father his slave.
</p>
<p>
And, knowing what he does, there is nothing to stop him becoming a father
himself.
</p>
<p>
I imagine his offspring, the cloning process continuing the moral mutation
I have already experienced with my first Clone.
</p>
<p>
“Let me think about it,” I say and I can feel his grin. I wonder how many
parents with children such as mine have had the same thought that I have
then:
</p>
<p>
<i>Please let me die before he does the dreadful things he has planned.</i>
</p>
<p>
At least, in my case, I fear this is guaranteed.

[*COMMENT]===============================================

[*ITEM]	Maximum Law - Christmas Party

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark

[*BLURB] "Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that."<br />
<small> Charles Dickens</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Marley <i>was</i> dead.
</p>
<p>
Found slumped against an overturned hot chestnut cart, shot four times in
the back. Both vendor and Marley’s partner were a no-show, leaving just the
man surrounded by a dark red stain on the slush.
</p>
<p>
No witnesses, no motive, no nothing for Maximum Law to chase down. We
really don’t like it when one of our own buys the farm, probably two if you
counted Bryce, currently MIA. Private security is as tight, tighter maybe
than regular law enforcement, because if we’re not there for each other
then no-one else is coming.
</p>
<p>
So there we were, Jim and I, filling dead man’s shoes on a bullshit
stakeout. The parents of J. Edward Jaeger, Esq. were worried their son and
heir was running with a bad crowd, and wanted an eye kept on him over the
festive season. White trash girlfriends were OK, even a bit of colour, but
anyone well shady was to be warned off. J. Edward had a political career
beckoning and couldn’t afford to have criminal ‘known associates’ pop up
down the line.
</p>
<p>
A low-viz stakeout as well, meaning no four-by in Max Law livery, no serious
hardware, no colours. Instead it was a vintage Volvo sedan, concealed
firearms and a cheap suit I’d last laundered before Independence Day. At
least the Volvo was roomy and had a heater that could account for global
warming all on its own. All we had to do was sit there and watch the odd
snowflake drifting in the still air.
</p>
<p>
I squirmed in the passenger seat. “What I want is-“
</p>
<p>
Jim laughed. “A strawberry shake. Jeez, man, you’re addicted. There are McD
support groups, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“<i>Actually</i>, what I want is apple pie. One of those pastry tubes with
the apple lava inside and seasonal cinnamon frosting. <i>And</i> a shake.
Look, rich-boy hasn’t moved from his pad in the last thirty hours and the
only callers have been fast-food deliveries. He’s either shacked up with
some honey or has a serious on-line gaming addiction. Either way we’re just
sitting here, getting slowly snowed in. I say we ask Central for a comfort
break.”
</p>
<p>
My partner shrugged. “Rather you than me, but feel free, bud.”
</p>
<p>
I sat and moped. We were both on serious downers due to complaints
concerning our past so-called ‘manic’ behaviour. Time just seemed to crawl
by and there was no action outside to speak of. Parkhurst was an area of
low-rent housing, high-end loft conversions and dilapidated light
industrial units. We were parked between parallel rows of semi-derelict
warehouses and might as well have been on the moon.
</p>
<p>
“Jesus, will you look at the ass on that!”
</p>
<p>
Jim’s voice made me jerk up as a woman passed us by, coming from behind.
Tall, with heavy curves, but none the worse for that. She was wearing just
a jacket and skirt despite the weather, a skirt so tight it could have been
sprayed on. Just the thing to brighten up a dull day, to zero in on, but
she left me cold.
</p>
<p>
The problem was I was taking Diligenz with a bromide bumper, as part of my
social responsibility regime, and if anything, the sight of her just
irritated me. I looked away, catching movement in the side mirror.
</p>
<p>
“Jim, some dude just walked up to the car, turned, and is walking away.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? So what? Maybe he remembered leaving the gas on, or something. How
about we change position? Just ease down the street a ways, at walking
pace. We can-“
</p>
<p>
“I’m on it, cover me.” I bailed from the Volvo, the heat bloom probably
showing up on satellite. I heard Jim cursing me, but he followed suit as I
was his partner and that beats a great ass. Points decision though, not a
knock-out. I eased away from the car rather than inspecting it straight
away, trying to see if our mystery guest was heading any place in
particular. He had definitely picked up the pace, trying to balance himself
with an outstretched left arm while fumbling in his pocket with the other.
</p>
<p>
A shimmer on the rear wing caught my eye, something straight out of a
barely remembered training vid. “Mimetic charge!”
</p>
<p>
Jim slid for cover as it went off; a self-adhesive explosive no thicker
than a sheet of paper, a shaped charge that blew the petrol tank and turned
the Volvo into an inferno in nothing flat. If the paintwork had been
factory-fresh I’d never have spotted it, but our ride was so dinged up and
resprayed that it defeated the chameleon biotech.
</p>
<p>
I yanked out my snub-nosed .38 and fired at the retreating figure. No
challenge, no warning, as I figured blowing up our car was pretty much a
statement of hostile intent. I hit him at least one out of three, which was
primo shooting seeing as how I was basically skating. Chummy fell backwards
and lay there, lolling on the pavement.
</p>
<p>
“Got your back, Matt,” said Jim. I glanced over the blazing wreck and saw him
half-crouching behind a big wheelie bin. He was fitting the barrel
extension and telescopic stock to his pistol, turning it into a light
carbine. I raised a hand by way of acknowledgement and closed in on our
erstwhile bomber. He was clutching his right shoulder; wounded, but I didn’t think fatally.
The .38 has piss-poor penetration over any distance and that looked like
the only hit. His long coat had come open and under it, I kid you not, he
was dressed as an elf - green tunic and calf-length trousers, red stockings
and belt. He even had stick-on pointy ears, although one had come adrift.
</p>
<p>
I kicked him in the injured shoulder. “Yo! Santa’s little helper! I know
I’m on the naughty list but this is a bit much, bro. What’s next?
Letter-bomb from Lapland? Aerial attack by Rudolph?” I kicked him again,
harder. “No time to be coy, man.”
</p>
<p>
He started swearing at me. At least, I think he was swearing – it sure
sounded like a long stream of invective, but in a language I didn’t know.
Not Russian, but definitely East European. I looked around but the few
pedestrians present were making tracks and Miss Curves had also vanished.
</p>
<p>
Jim eased up to me, sweeping the carbine across the surrounding buildings,
but no one else seemed interested in us. “I figure bozo here comes from the
Lapland Lounge. Only place that would warrant a get-up like that.”
</p>
<p>
“The where?”
</p>
<p>
He gestured with his gun. “On the corner. They’ve converted the ground
floor of that warehouse into a seasonal lap-dancing joint. A strictly ad
hoc commercial opportunity for as long as it takes the regular cops to turn
up and close it down. If your dick wasn’t in down-time you might have
noticed the clients, or, more importantly, the girls, traipsing in and
out.”
</p>
<p>
I sniffed. “Yeah, well, I suppose some guys get off on Mrs Claus and
over-priced eggnog. Just as long as the extras don’t include bondage – I
find tinsel ticklish.”
</p>
<p>
Jim laughed. “You pat this guy down yet?”
</p>
<p>
“Waiting for you to get your ass in gear.” I knelt down and retrieved a .45
semi-automatic from a coat pocket. “Naughty elf! Didn’t Santa teach you
that playing with guns is a gender-stereotype?” I glanced at Jim. “I’d cuff
him but applied pressure will cut down on blood loss, and we might need to
bring in a live one this time round.”
</p>
<p>
My partner snorted. “Like I care after he lit us up….cuff his ankles then.”
</p>
<p>
I snapped on the Two-Bars, making sure they were nice and tight, and stood
up. Bozo gave us more mouth, but to my ears it was all just it was all just
vowels. Given the Volvo was toast our LoJack would go off-air, alerting
Central. The smart move was to hole-up someplace with our prisoner,
preferably someplace warm, and wait for back-up.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, right.
</p>
<p>
I scoped the Lapland Lounge and rubbed my nose. “I don’t fancy just busting
in through the front door. If chummy here is anything to go by then I think
we can expect a warm welcome.”
</p>
<p>
“No lie. I was looking at the loading bay, in the side alley. I can see the
shutters are down but there should be some kind of foot access as well.”
</p>
<p>
I grinned. “Sounds like a plan. Our friend here doesn’t have a phone so I
say we just leave him for whoever Central sends out to check.”
</p>
<p>
“Cool. I’ll lead this time. I’ve got a full-auto option.”
</p>
<p>
I took the elf’s pistol and switched the .38 to my left, more for ease of
access than a true two-gun stance, which is a damn sight more difficult to
co-ordinate than it appears on film. We slithered along to the alley, which
had the benefit of being less well travelled and thus less of a compacted
surface. No footprints led to or from the loading bay, so we hustled over.
</p>
<p>
Next to the main entrance was a blank wooden door, padlocked, with two
planks nailed across. The frame was rotten, though, and a couple of kicks
tore the hasp free. Stamping broke the lower plank, giving us enough room
to crouch and push through to the inside.
</p>
<p>
The bay was in near darkness, the only illumination coming from snow and
cobweb covered panel windows either side of the main entrance. There was no
emergency lighting and, more importantly, no audible alarm to betray our
presence. We moved up onto the walkway and through a set of double doors at
the rear. They swung shut behind us, and it was dark.
</p>
<p>
I widened my eyes, like you’re supposed to, but all I could see was the
suggestion of corridors leading straight on and off to the left. “Got a
flashlight?”
</p>
<p>
“Nope. I can hear music though.”
</p>
<p>
Jim was right, there was a bass beat coming from someplace ahead, and to
the left. “Split up or stay tight? Your call, kemosabe.”
</p>
<p>
He snorted. “Never leave your wingman? These corridors are like shooting
galleries, so if someone gets the jump on us we’re both dogfood. Nah, I say
we split up, come at them from two directions. Which is to say I catch the
bad guys while you blunder about in the back rooms.”
</p>
<p>
“In your dreams. Just head for the gunfire when you hear me start shooting,
OK? I’ll go straight on. Stay frosty.”
</p>
<p>
“Just call me the Snowman.”
</p>
<p>
I moved on, through another set of double doors, and the music became
appreciably louder. A short passage ending in a closed door took me closer
to the source, so I pocketed the .38 and tried the handle. It turned. I
still couldn’t tell if there was light on the other side but at the risk of
storming a broom closet I shouldered my way in.
</p>
<p>
Desk, desk lamp, man standing there. He had a ziplock bag in each hand,
matching bags in the two open attaché cases on the desk in front of him.
</p>
<p>
I laughed. “Who the hell are you, the ghost of Don Johnson?” If you’d seen
him you’d understand; white linen suit, white loafers, black t-shirt. He
had the jacket sleeves rolled back and sunglasses in his breast pocket.
</p>
<p>
The dude sounded more affronted than surprised. “I’ll have you know this is
still considered a cool look, in some quarters.”
</p>
<p>
“And disco is making a comeback, I know. You do realise the Miami Vice
retrospective at the Roxy was <i>last</i> month, man? Now, hands up.” There
was something wrong, though, an itch in my nose and my eyes were stinging.
I realised he was wearing nose filters and his bloodshot eyes were actually
ocular shields to prevent membrane penetration.
</p>
<p>
I sneezed, violently.
</p>
<p>
The dude slapped the two bags he was holding together, arms outstretched,
like soft symbols. I sneezed again, unable to avoid breathing in some of
the grey-white cloud that burst over me.
</p>
<p>
Laughter. Gunfire. Pokers jammed in my eyes. Ice creeping over my skin,
followed by the fires of Hell. The room as bright as a searchlight,
bleaching out all colour. More gunfire. I sank to my knees, wheezing, my
world shrinking to a small image of reality at the end of a long grey
tunnel. I blinked, my eyelids scraping back and forth. My head spun with
360&deg; vision. Technicolor burst from my eyeballs, repainting the room as I
watched.
</p>
<p>
I blinked.
</p>
<p>
The door opposite lay open and I was alone. My skull itched on the inside.
My dick was like an iron bar. The .45 was empty, the slide fully back. I
dropped it and fumbled the .38 from my pocket, finding it as easy to use in
my left hand as my right. Standing up proved not as difficult as I feared
but walking was a whole new experience. I shuffled forwards, hands by my
side.
</p>
<p>
Through the open door was a larger area used as a dressing room by the
girls working the Lounge; clothes racks, cosmetics, personal items, garden
furniture tables and chairs. A frightened looking bottle-blonde stood
across from me, clutching her robe together like a safety blanket. I wanted
to speak, to reassure her, but my mouth was sown together with barbed wire.
Gurgling in Morse Code came to mind, but she didn’t look that nautical,
despite the dolphin tattoo on her forearm.
</p>
<p>
Double doors to my right burst open and a man entered, holding a
pump-action shotgun with pistol grip. It was Bryce, Marley’s missing
partner. He just looked at me and laughed. “You greased, man? Jesus, Matt,
you are <i>wired</i>. Marley objected to me taking a line or two but you,
you’ve got enough primo gear on you to qualify as intent to distribute.”
</p>
<p>
I formed the words, my lips moved, but somewhere along the way silence
stole my vocal cords. Bryce lowered his gun, sniggering. “You’re a heart
attack waiting to happen, bro. Just sit down and enjoy the rush while you
can. I’d recommend Carla here, but from the look of you she’d need a week
off afterwards to recover.”
</p>
<p>
A spasm shook me, spittle and drool from my mouth.
</p>
<p>
Bryce pulled up a chair and straddled it. “You know, Matt, we’re a lot
alike. We both appreciate a high, we both know when to bend, to go with the
flow. I mean, it’s not like that rich kid actually needs us, right? Us
sitting outside in the street, day in, day out, it was bad for business. So
why not ditch the car out of sight and enjoy what the Lapland Lounge has to
offer? Hell, they were even willing to throw in something over and above
the freebies. Marley, though, he was too rigid, too married, too old.”
</p>
<p>
I swallowed, managed not to choke. “You, me. Big difference.”
</p>
<p>
He grinned. “Oh yeah, what’s that?”
</p>
<p>
I turned and shot him in the face. “You’re dead.”
</p>
<p>
Carla sucked in a big lungful of air ahead of a scream but it never came.
My legs took me over to Bryce and I picked up the shotgun where he’d
dropped it, placing my revolver in his pocket. I fished out his wallet and
threw it to fall at Carla’s feet. “Get dressed, get out.”
</p>
<p>
Movement was Zen; I seemed to become one with where I wanted to go without
any appreciable effort on my part. The double doors, the corridor beyond –
this one with overhead strip lighting – more doors, another, narrower,
corridor. Two anxious female faces peered from different doorways, one
wearing a shorty Mrs Santa dress, the other only a clutched towel. They
both vanished when they saw the shotgun leading me forward.
</p>
<p>
I was one with the gun and the gun knew where to go.
</p>
<p>
Music welled up as an unseen door opened ahead of me. An armed elf
appeared, his .45 cocked. Amateur. I shot him in the chest before his face
managed to register surprise. Someone screamed but I don’t think it was me.
</p>
<p>
I entered the Lounge proper.
</p>
<p>
Main lighting off. A girl paused in the act of pole-dancing, looking in my
direction. A makeshift bar on cloth-covered trestle tables to my left.
Heavy drapes hiding the bare walls. Scattered garden furniture with battery
camping lamps on each table. A smattering of pale faces in the gloom,
turned towards me like luminescent sunflowers.
</p>
<p>
I fired into the ceiling by way of introduction, my voice a roar to match
that of my weapon. “MAXIMUM LAW! YOU ARE ALL <i>SO</i> BUSTED!”. I heard
the <i>rak-rak</i> of a new round being chambered as the shotgun reloaded
itself.
</p>
<p>
Someone shot me.
</p>
<p>
The shotgun returned fire, then swung away to let the floor come up and
smack me in the mouth.
</p>
<p>
I blinked.
</p>
<p>
I was wet.
</p>
<p>
I was on my back, on the floor, a man crouched down beside me although I
couldn’t make out his face. He was holding a water-charged fire
extinguisher, which explained why I was wet.
</p>
<p>
“Lie still, officer, you’ve been shot. Left side, through-and-through, but
I think no serious damage. I decided to wash off whatever recreational
pharmaceuticals you were covered in, either that or watch the paramedics
get high trying to treat you.”
</p>
<p>
A rich baritone, not a voice I recognised. I coughed. “My partner?”
</p>
<p>
“Sprained ankle, although the injury to his pride is quite severe. He’s at
the entrance, still waiting for backup. Everyone you didn’t manage to shoot
has made themselves scarce.”
</p>
<p>
“Who the hell are you, then?”
</p>
<p>
I could hear the smile in his voice. “Just a civilian enjoying the
facilities, until you barged in. But I used to work for Max, so I’ll skate
on this one. In fact I used to be a lot like you, right down to the
bull-headed belief in my own immortality. These days I’m a parole officer
and you’d be amazed at just how many of those I deal with were formerly in
law enforcement, particularly the private sector. The badge, the vest, the
gun, I’m well aware of the allure. Just remember that being part of the law
doesn’t mean you’re above it. It catches up with most of us, eventually.”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry? What does?”
</p>
<p>
“Justice. Now, I really must be going but your partner is within earshot if
need be. Keep the faith.”
</p>
<p>
He stood, a towering figure against the overhead lights, and vanished from
my field of view. My side felt like I’d been kicked by a steel-toed boot,
but it was tolerable. The rest of me burned from the inside out, and I was
surprised my drenched clothes weren’t steaming. Just lying there, waiting
for the medics to pitch up and carry me off, isn’t my style. Pointless
machismo I know, but I’d have done it even without the drugs coursing
through my system.
</p>
<p>
Sitting up hurt, standing even more so.
</p>
<p>
The shotgun got left behind as I needed both hands to lever myself off the
floor. Once upright, no way was I bending down to retrieve it, and it could
probably take care of itself. I was semi-mobile, clutching my side, by the
time Jim limped up.
</p>
<p>
I just looked at him. “Sprained ankle?”
</p>
<p>
He at least had the good grace to look embarrassed. “Dude, what can I say?
It wasn’t even a bad sprain, but enough to keep me out of things. I’m
sorry.”
</p>
<p>
“Forget it, man. The way I was acting I’d probably have shot you as well.”
</p>
<p>
“True, true, the paperwork on this one is gonna’ be a bitch. The cavalry
are here, so we’d better step outside.”
</p>
<p>
As we hobbled towards the sound of approaching sirens a door blew open
somewhere, letting in a chill blast that made me shiver. Suddenly I felt, I
felt <i>old</i>, like it wasn’t all just a glorious game anymore.
</p>
<p>
I heard a voice on the wind.
</p>
<p>

[*BLURB] "Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that."<br />
<small> Charles Dickens</small>.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Marley <i>was</i> dead.
<br/>
<br/>
He lay face-down in the grey snow, stabbed three times from behind. I wiped
my blade on his overcoat and walked away into the shadows. Two hard-eyed
street urchins had witnessed my crime from behind a water butt, but they
were of no consequence. Allowing them to pick the body clean of valuables
would ensure their silence if ever brought before a magistrate.
<br/>
<br/>
The partnership of Marley and Scrooge had been dissolved. It remained to be
seen how favourably Mister Ebenezer Scrooge reacted to the news.
<br/>
<br/>
I left the narrow alleyway and rejoined the main thoroughfare. The
Christmas Eve throng of pedestrians clogged the street, slowing my
progress. Several passers-by greeted me as I made my way amongst them. I
acknowledged each with a smile and a touch of my top hat, but nothing more.
None of them really knew me, of course, but I have a face that many find
familiar. Mere memories of childhood dreams, if they but knew it.
<br/>
<br/>
My entire body itched as if constrained by over-tight clothing. I longed to
break free: to shout, scream, kick against the dead weight of Victorian
sentimentality that threatened to crush my wild spirit. Inwardly I raged at
the stultifying conservatism of my fellow pedestrians, but did nothing. I
was bound by the conventions of this genre like Prometheus to his rock.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>
    But listen closely, not for very much longer, I've got to keep control.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
A random memory, a snatch of song lyrics, lifted my spirits. I hummed the
tune under my breath until reaching my destination; a narrow-fronted town
house showing signs of neglect. I sidled around to the back door and stood,
listening for the tell-tale crunch of following footsteps, but there was
nothing. I rapped softly on the door with my cane and waited.
<br/>
<br/>
And waited.
<br/>
<br/>
No lantern was lit but eventually I heard the turn of a key, a bolt being
withdrawn, and the door opened a fraction. “Yes?”
<br/>
<br/>
The voice from within was entirely devoid of the frailty one associates
with the elderly. Here was a man who mouthed malice as surely as a set of
dentures. I inclined my head. “What was to be done has been done. I suggest
we conclude our contract in private.”
<br/>
<br/>
The gap opened wider and I stepped inside, standing while my host secured
the door behind me. The rasp of a match brought life to a candle stub and I
regarded my client, Mister Ebenezer Scrooge. The paltry flame he held was
enough to show a threadbare housecoat worn over his bed gown, pale legs
thrust into mismatched slippers.
<br/>
<br/>
He sniffed. “You’re sure? I’ll want proof positive before parting with the
sum we agreed.”
<br/>
<br/>
I snapped my fingers.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>“Murder, horrible murder in Whitechapel! Jacob Marley found dead!”</i>
<br/>
<br/>
The cry of the news vendor reached us plain enough. It’s a little trick of
mine, a form of narrative acceleration I’ve found useful on occasion. The
reference to ‘Whitechapel’ gave me pause, but I had no time to dwell on the
apparent incongruity. “Your business partner is dead, sir. You may rest
assured of that. Now, to business?”
<br/>
<br/>
With evident reluctance Scrooge set down his candle and lifted a tea towel,
revealing a small strongbox. From this he withdrew a stack of gold
sovereigns and thrust them into my hand. “Now, begone, and never-” He broke
off, staring at a point over my right shoulder. “Ye Gods, what have you
brought to my house?”
<br/>
<br/>
I dropped the coins, seized the top of my cane and twisted, freeing the
slender blade housed within. Swinging around I slashed at the spot which
had so transfixed Scrooge, but found nothing. Fearing betrayal I turned
again and pressed the point of my swordstick against his neck. The ice-blue
metal glowed softly, lending his skin the pallor of a three-day-old corpse.
It also revealed the abject terror in his eyes. No attempted ambush then,
but some genuine threat.
<br/>
<br/>
My voice was a snarl. “Out with it, man, what has you so afeared?”
<br/>
<br/>
He swallowed with difficulty. “Smoke from the candle. It swirled as if in a
draft, but there is none. It took on the form of a face, such a face as I
have never…”
<br/>
<br/>
I thrust him aside and bent down, snatching up such coins as came readily
to hand. Leaving Scrooge I strode down the hall and unbarred the front
door. Taking a moment to compose myself, I sheathed my blade and stepped
out onto the pavement. My only defence lay in the company of strangers,
those who could not be held to account for my crimes. I set off diagonally
across the street – thankfully free of any traffic other than pedestrians.
What stalked me was the embodiment of guilt, guilt that I did not feel as a
consequence of my actions.
<br/>
<br/>
I needed to find someone, I needed to find…
<br/>
<br/>
An aged flower seller, muffled against the cold, making her way home. She
still carried a few blooms in her wicker basket, prominent amongst them a
solitary red carnation. I touched cane to hat by way of introduction and
her resigned features slid into an approximation of welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
“And how may I serve you, good sir, on this most auspicious of evenings?”
<br/>
<br/>
“That carnation of yours. Grown in a hothouse I shouldn’t wonder, and
expensive.”
<br/>
<br/>
“A fine bloom, to be sure, but one that won’t last. Perhaps a sprig of
heather-”
<br/>
<br/>
I flicked the flower into the air using the tip of my cane and caught it
deftly in my left hand. Pinching off the stem between finger and thumb I
slid it into place as my buttonhole.
<br/>
<br/>
She inclined her head in acknowledgment of my dexterity. “Perhaps, sir,
sixpence? Given the time of year and seasonal goodwill?”
<br/>
<br/>
In response I pressed a sovereign into her hand. “I insist you accept this
as full payment, and may I wish you a Merry Christmas.”
<br/>
<br/>
The crone gazed in wonder at the gold coin. “And a Merry Christmas to you,
sir. And may I say…”
<br/>
<br/>
But I had moved on, ducking into a quiet alleyway. The veneer of Victorian
convention started to crack and I felt a savage grin spread across my face.
I’m the Iceman, a killer, and I stalk Wonderland for those with the means
to pay for my services.
<br/>
<br/>
Jack Frost, at your service.
<br/>
<br/>
I’d worked for Father Christmas to get back in his good books but it was
obvious the fat bastard had welched on the deal. Eventually The Man would
notice and hold him to account, but by then I’d be history. Bad things
happen to those on the Naughty List, and this particular Bad Thing was hard
on my tail. My random act of generosity, even born of cynical
self-preservation, would hold it at bay for a while. I’d bought myself some
time, but not long. The faint sound of jingle bells drew my gaze upwards.
The sky was empty save for drifting snowflakes; lost souls, each following
their own path to oblivion.
<br/>
<br/>
Not my fate. Not yet, at any rate.
<br/>
<br/>
I needed a gun, but the only firearms this Dickensian niche had to offer
were cumbersome pistols or a comedic blunderbuss. Neither had the stopping
power to see off a Bad Thing, even at point-blank range. Not that you could
ever kill it. The best you could hope for was a few hours respite while it
lurked in the shadows, reforming. Luckily my latest crime had drawn it like
a moth to the flame, before it was fully formed and ready to torment me. I
wouldn’t be so fortunate a second time.
<br/>
<br/>
So, there was no mileage in hanging around, even assuming I could
ingratiate myself with the likes of Bob Cratchit and his family. It was
time to pay the real world a visit, but without leaving any trace of where
I’d gone. And for that I needed to snag a dreamer. Standing in a recessed
doorway I struck my cane three times on the flagstones.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Close your eyes and set your mind free…</i>
<br/>
<br/>
My dreamer was agitated, their point of view swooping between the buildings
like a swallow. That meant they were on the point of waking up, but I
couldn’t wait for someone more deeply immersed. I followed, letting the
perspective of my mind’s eye catch up slowly. I had to take things
cautiously in case that feeling of ‘something behind you’ was enough to
push them into consciousness. I felt the prickle of awareness as my dreamer
experienced a change of persona, my persona, but that meant I could turn
and look back to where they’d come from.
<br/>
<br/>
A twist of silver winding back through the streets – Ariadne’s thread for
the mind. I followed, my imaginary pace quickening until the buildings on
either side became blurs, people beneath me mere flickers of humanity. All
detail faded until I was rushing down a dark tunnel, the only illumination
my path to salvation. Ahead of me I could sense a blank wall, the end of
all songs, the barrier between…
<br/>
<br/>
The world blinked. The world became…real.
<br/>
<br/>
A medium sized bedroom in darkness. Central heating, street lights visible
through the curtains, a figure lying in a single bed. I’m not the Tooth
Fairy, I don’t get a kick from creeping around, watching kids while they
sleep. There was a burble of TV from downstairs so that meant a quick exit
via the window was in order. I slid the catch open but the damn thing
wouldn’t budge. I propped my cane against the wall and used both hands, but
still no joy.
<br/>
<br/>
“There’s a trick to it. You need to lift from the top, not the bottom.
Otherwise it always sticks like that.”
<br/>
<br/>
I froze. It was a girl’s voice; young, but older than anticipated. I stood
upright and turned around, trying to think of what to say. The bedside lamp
came on.
<br/>
<br/>
“You’re Jack Frost.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Says who?” Instinctive denial – always my first line of defense.
<br/>
<br/>
“I’m Carole Geola. I’m twelve.” She had fair hair and freckles. I could see
no superabundance of soft toys to indicate an immature intellect for her
age.
<br/>
<br/>
“Twelve? But you still believe in me?”
<br/>
<br/>
She nodded. “Oh yeah, I’ve seen you before.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Somehow I seriously doubt that.” The only people who knew me were clients,
confederates or victims. Sometimes two from three.
<br/>
<br/>
“Three years ago, when we had all that snow. My dad built a winter hide in
the garden, so I could watch the animals coming in from the woods to feed.
The patio doors were all covered in frost and I saw you step out of them.
All white at first, then you coloured in. You wore the same red waistcoat.”
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to smile. “Neat trick, eh?”
<br/>
<br/>
Carole cocked her head to one side. “You killed a man just now. In my
dream. I saw you.”
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Tricky. </i>
“Ah, that wasn’t real, OK? It was just like a story you watched, with me as
an actor.”
<br/>
<br/>
She frowned. “I could hear you in my head, afterwards. Just before I woke
up. You were afraid, trying to get away. It wasn’t an act.”
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Damn tricky</i>
. But maybe twelve was old enough to understand. “OK, Carole, it <i>was</i>
real, in a way. But that man was going to die, regardless, even if I hadn’t
been there. That’s just the way he was written. All I did was use his
death, the circumstances of his death, for my own ends.”
<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t understand.” She drew her knees up and hugged them.
<br/>
<br/>
“Right, look, ah, stories, usually old stories, they can become real. Not
real as in here, but real as in the place you go when you dream. Some fade
away but others last forever, all existing side-by-side. Like, like a big
theme park.”
<br/>
<br/>
That wasn’t half of it. Belief kept a storyline alive, feeding on each
dreamer who visited it. That generally meant children, the devout and the
seriously disturbed. Wonderland was an unstable mix of fairytale, religious
fervour and the plain mad. It takes some getting used to.
<br/>
<br/>
My pre-teen interrogator bit her lip. “Stories like Twilight?”
<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, no, only tales written by hand, with a pen. There’s something in the
ink that captures the imagination, makes it real. People wrote about me, a
long, <i>long</i> time ago, and I’ve been around ever since. It’s the same
with all the classic fairy tales, including the scary ones.”
<br/>
<br/>
Carole stared at me hard for a moment – looking a damn sight older than
twelve – then sniffed. “You came here to hide, to get away.” A statement
rather than question.
<br/>
<br/>
I shrugged. “There are dreams and there are nightmares, even for people
like me. You visit Wonderland when you’re asleep, and leave it behind when
you wake up. For me, for all of us who live there, you don’t get to wake
up. Coming here - your world, the real world – is my escape. Except that I
can’t stay for long.” I cleared my throat. “Speaking of which…”
<br/>
<br/>
“You’d better go, in case my mum looks in.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Damn straight.” I turned and slid the window up. It was Christmas Eve – no
snow, but at least dry and frosty. My home turf. I removed my top hat,
pressed it flat, and sent it spinning off into the shadows. My swordstick
was another matter. I lifted it and turned towards Carole. “You give it a
sharp twist like this, then pull. Careful though, it’s sharp enough to cut
the air itself. Call it an early Christmas present.”
<br/>
<br/>
“For me? Cool.”
<br/>
<br/>
“You bet. Because it comes from Wonderland it’ll be there when you dream,
if you need it. Sometimes a blade beats running away, hands down.” I placed
the cane on the end of her bed. “Oh, and if you see Santa, give him a poke
from me.” She giggled.
<br/>
<br/>
I eased out of the window and slithered down the drainpipe, leaving a trail
of fern-leaf frosting. The garden was quiet, the air still as stone. My
feet left no imprint as I walked over to the gate. Looking back I saw
Carole at the open window, waving. I bowed in return, then turned away –
smiling.
<br/>
<br/>
It’s always good to meet a fan.

<small>Seneca</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The Nones fell early that Aperas. That meant corvée, a day of obligatory
service to Eryx the Rex. At dawn, Aule the headman mustered the pagani and
made them prune Eryx's olive groves, heavy with new spring shoots. They
piled up severed branches while gray partridges sang nearby.
</p>
<p>
"I could have sown oats or tended my own grove," Thresu said.
</p>
<p>
"Hush before Aule overhears you," Larth said.
</p>
<p>
"As if I cared a fig- Wait. Do you hear something?"
</p>
<p>
Larth cocked his head and listened intently. He pointed to the forest past
the grove, thick with towering oaks, beeches, and pines.
</p>
<p>
"Someone's come through the pass."
</p>
<p>
A continuous rustle grew steadily louder, like the rush of waves, hooves
shuffling through dirt with horns' click and occasional plaintive moos.
</p>
<p>
"Cattle," Thresu said.
</p>
<p>
The men ran to the grove's edge. Tamped down over centuries, a hard, dirt
path wound past the grove and into the dark forest. A magnificent red bull
emerged from the shadows, twenty hands high, long horns tipped by bronze
globes, an iron bell hung from his neck whose clapper gently clanged as he
led the way. A herd followed, several hundred cattle, scarlet hided, long 
horned and legged, rugged and bad tempered right down to the calves, flanks and
sides heavy with beef and tallow despite plainly having traveled far.
</p>
<p>
Beside himself with greed, Aule slavered like a starving man. "Surely this
is Tin's bounty. We're rich."
</p>
<p>
"There's a herdsman," Larth said.
</p>
<p>
A man drove the herd with a dog. He whistled and clapped to move the herd
along, threw small stones, and sent the dog to nip at their heels. Both
were of heroic stature to match the cattle they drove. The dog was shaggy,
black haired, with a demon's pointed ears and long, sharp teeth. His black
iron collar had finger-long spikes. Clad in a red wool kilt, a lionskin
tied around his waist, the man was tall, broad shouldered with a gleaming
bronze body, his curly hair and beard jet black. He was armed with a
composite, ram's horn bow, a short sword, and a dagger. The arrows in his
quiver were as long as a normal man's arm.
</p>
<p>
"You take him, headman," Thresu said. "We'll hold your cloak."
</p>
<p>
"That's enough insolence, Thresu. Just for that, run to Tarquinia. Tell the
guards a stranger's trespassing with cattle."
</p>
<p>
Thresu scowled, but still obeyed, and set off at a swift trot for the urbs.
Aule and the men watched the stranger and his herd go down the path. A wide
vista opened up, a broad and fertile valley, well watered, green with lush
forests and thick fields. A rich and mighty urbs stood in the distance on a
high hilltop, built of white marble with mighty granite walls.
</p>
<p>
The herd came to a swift stream and spread out to water. The herdsman went
upstream above the herd, knelt by the bank, bent low, and drank from his
cupped hand. There was a rumble of bronze shod hooves. The herdsman rose,
unslung his bow, and nocked an arrow.
</p>
<p>
Horsemen rode up on the stream's opposite side, armed with bows, swords,
and spears. Two young men in the lead wore bronze helmets, cuirasses, and
greaves; the rest had leather armor. They halted at the stream's edge.
</p>
<p>
"Ohe, drover," 
one young man said. "Who gave you leave to water your dirty
cattle in our stream? Do you know whose lands you trespass upon? This is
the Valley of Volturmna, the realm of my Pater, Eryx the Rex."
</p>
<p>
The herdsman lowered his bow. He smiled, a vast expanse of white teeth.
</p>
<p>
"Forgive me, my lord. I am Melkart, a traveler from a far land. I only seek
water for these cattle as I pass through. That and no more, I humbly beg."
</p>
<p>
He spoke Rasennan, but with a strange, heavy accent, foreign, unknown.
</p>
<p>
"Hear that, Phobis? He begs."
</p>
<p>
"What a craven paganus. He's more fit for a catamite than a drover," the
other young man said. He was slickly handsome, but a superior sneer marred
his good looks. "Antagones. Tell him to leave the cattle here as the toll
for crossing our valley. Maybe then we'll let him and his flea-ridden dog
pass in peace."
</p>
<p>
"Good idea. Caile, cut the cattle out and drive them back to Tarquinia."
</p>
<p>
A buck toothed man grinned. "Aye, Lord."
</p>
<p>
He drew his sword, put his heels to his mount, and charged across the
stream. Caile screamed and whooped to stampede the herd, but they simply
watched him incuriously.
</p>
<p>
Melkart raised his bow, drew the arrow back, and released it. The 
goose-feathered shaft went deep into Caile's chest. Caile fell from his horse
into the stream where he bobbed, dead before he hit the water.
</p>
<p>
"Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
The dog snarled, leaped across the stream in one bound, ran to the nearest
rider, and dragged him from his mount. Once down, Kaleb savaged the
helpless man. The riderless horse stampeded away.
</p>
<p>
"Retreat. Run for it," Antagones cried.
</p>
<p>
Riders sawed on reins, wheeled their horses around, and frantically urged
them into flight. They heedlessly left their comrade behind to his grisly
fate.
</p>
<p>
"That's enough, Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
The dog left the man alone. Badly mauled, he got to his feet, left arm
cradled in his right, and staggered away, sobbing miserably. Kaleb trotted
back across the stream, tongue gently lolling from his bloodstained mouth.
He approached Melkart, head low, tail wagging. Melkart petted and caressed
him.
</p>
<p>
"Good dog, Kaleb. When I kill a deer tonight, you'll get the liver."
</p>
<p class=drop>Melkart and Kaleb drove the herd across the stream and down the path again.
At a hill's crest, the path broadened into a level road, hard packed by
corvée laborers, paved with flagstones, flanked by rows of tall, pale green
cypress trees. Fledgling wheat stalks waved in terraced fields on either
side. Hummocks marked where cunningly designed underground pipes bore water
to irrigate the land, laid out in painstaking detail by haruspices in
conformity with the disciplina etrusca. Boundary lines were marked by stone
herms with horned, snarling features and grotesquely large phalluses. Every
detail was crisply distinct in the rarefied Volturmnine air, fresh and pure
as Olympian ichor. The morn was fair, the breeze still fresh with dew, but
Melkart pushed on with his herd, determined to cover three leagues that
day.
</p>
<p>
There was a glimpse of saffron and scarlet ahead. Melkart unslung his bow
again.
</p>
<p>
A procession slowly approached, a heavy, bearded man on a sedan chair clad
in a saffron silk synthesina and a red cloak, borne by six bearers with a
retinue of slaves in white linen tunics before and behind him, the nearest
equipped with large, ostrich feather fans to keep mosquitoes and other
winged insects away.
</p>
<p>
Bemused, Melkart lowered his bow. He went to the head of the herd, grabbed
the bull by his collar, and halted him. The other cattle stopped in their
tracks. The procession came near. Bearers lowered the sedan chair and
helped the corpulent man to his feet. Hem held high to keep his synthesina
free from dirt, he bowed low while the slaves prostrated themselves on the
paving stones. He carried a slender, white ivory staff, the token of his
authority.
</p>
<p>
"I am Churinas, chief steward of Eryx the Rex, Lord of Volturmna. You will
forgive this terrible misunderstanding. A foolish paganus, a man named
Thresu, spread a malicious report about a herdsman setting his cattle to
graze in freshly sown fields. Lord Eryx sent his sons out to investigate.
What followed was something best laid at Hekate's door."
</p>
<p>
Melkart laughed.
</p>
<p>
"There's really no need to bow. I'm no lord, just Melkart, a herdsman. Let
me pass through and I'll be content. After all, I killed a man and my dog
mauled another. And yet you claim no blood debt? You puzzle me."
</p>
<p>
Churinas shrugged. "Mere mercenaries, born to suffer and die. We've
offended the rules of hospitality and must make amends. Thresu has been
thrashed and put under arrest to teach him never to bear errant, lying
tales again. My lord has ordered me to escort you to Tarquinia where you'll
be his honored guest. Your cattle will rest in his cattle pens and fatten on
oats and millet, just like his own stock. Wine, bread, and opson await you,
eggs and cheese, smoked wild boar, spit roasted goats, and beef haunches in
honey sauce. Young, lissome boys and girls will bathe you in rose scented
water and clothe you in finery. All this to make amends."
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled.
</p>
<p>
"Lord Eryx is most gracious. It's been long since I've known civilized
pleasures. After many nights camping rough in the open, a good feast and a
soft bed under a roof sound like Elysium. Does Lord Eryx give his solemn
bond there's no blood feud over the slain man?"
</p>
<p>
Churinas bowed low again. "Just as you say. Nothing that can't be worked
out between friends over an elegant repast. I had the slaves bring another
sedan chair. You must be tired after traveling countless leagues."
</p>
<p>
Melkart laughed again. "No need as long as I've two good legs to hold me
up. Lead on to Tarquinia, Churinas."
</p>
<p>
They formed a strange company. Churinas led in his sedan chair, accompanied
by bearers and other attendants. Melkart followed with his rough and unruly
herd and savage hound. As they went deeper into the valley, Volturmna's
boundless wealth was apparent everywhere. Green forests teemed with birds
and game. One rich, well run farm after another came into view, black
bottom land planted with well tilled wheat fields, higher ground studded
with thick branched olive groves, terraced hilltops festooned with fresh
budded grape vines, barnyards packed with fat, healthy poultry, swine, and
milch cows.
</p>
<p>
Despite the evident prosperity, there was a curious, gloomy pall over the
land, so thick and persistent even Melkart noticed, intent as he was on the
prospect of an upcoming feast. In the fields, hinds and masters alike kept
their heads sullenly down as they went about their tasks, with occasional
stealthy, sidelong, malicious glances toward the procession from those
nearby. No one waved in greeting. Men and women were dressed in black
mourning, many young, too many for such a rich and giving land.
</p>
<p class=drop>The road ascended until they reached Tarquinia. Like every Rasennan
stronghold, it was situated on a high hilltop. Natural ramparts were
further strengthened by Cyclopean granite walls fifteen cubits high.
Livestock pens were set up at the foot of the hill for pagani when they
came to market. Melkart led the bull into the main corral while Kaleb
nipped at the herd’s heels to drive them inside. He closed the corral gate.
Slaves threw armfuls of fresh green hay into the corral. The herd spread
out to eat.
</p>
<p>
"Keep watch, Kaleb. I'll return to see you're fed and the herd's bedded
down."
</p>
<p>
Kaleb looked Melkart in the eye, understanding evident.
</p>
<p>
"Good boy."
</p>
<p>
Churinas got out of his sedan chair. He gently took Melkart by the elbow.
</p>
<p>
"By Tin, what a giant. Eryx will be so impressed. This way, Melkart."
</p>
<p>
A causeway led to the gates. Defended by high, flanking towers, the broad
gates were topped by a brightly painted, bas-relief sculpture of a pillar
flanked by twin rampant lions. Tall, bronze studded oak doors swung open.
Guards bowed as they passed, although several shot Melkart dirty looks. The
guardhouse was to the right, the granary to the left. The palace stood at
the peak, large, multi-storied, and painted bright red and dark blue with
terracotta roof tiles. A temple of equal size stood on a lower crest, well
proportioned, beautifully adorned with gold and silver, blood red, thick
columns' capitals sculpted like flowering acanthus, the tile roof edged by
terracotta antefixes that depicted bearded haruspices wearing high crowned,
broad brimmed straw hats, the roof's peak adorned with a triumphal quadriga
that bore a winged Victory. Hints of burning frankincense and myrrh wafted
from the altar set in a sunken terrace before the temple.
</p>
<p>
It was well into morning, but the urbs was empty. Elegantly enclosed by a
marble peristyle, the forum was deserted, stalls empty of wares and without
merchants, with only shadows for customers. Melkart saw no one apart from
Churinas, servants, and the guard. There were a few private houses, but the
shutters were closed, the residents secluded inside despite the fine
weather. They walked up the long stairway to the palace and through another
gate into a small courtyard. Antagones and Phobis were there, dressed in
spotless, white wool tunics and togas. A tall, older man stood before them,
also in a toga, scant hair iron gray, a once muscular body gone to fat from
too much indulgence. Four lictors attended them, dressed in short tunics.
Each man carried a banded bundle of wooden clubs with a double headed ax in
the middle.
</p>
<p>
Melkart put his right hand to his heart and bowed low.
</p>
<p>
"Lord Eryx. I humbly thank you for your hospitality. I am Melkart."
</p>
<p>
Eryx's mouth spread wide in a black toothed smile. "So this is the fellow.
You must be Laran's own child."
</p>
<p>
He turned to Antagones and Phobis. "And you dared offer battle to him? You
are indeed my sons. Afraid of nothing."
</p>
<p>
Eryx faced Melkart again. "We never get visitors like you. Just vagabonds
or thieves or cattle raiders from Veii. I'll give a real banquet tonight,
no stinting either, a royal feast. For now, bathe, rest. Take your ease
after a long, hard journey."
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled, but puzzlement lingered in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
"I thank you, Lord Eryx, but you give far more than my due. I'm only a
drover. A good meal and a place by the kitchen hearth will be more than
enough."
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense. A man of such stature and strength deserves only the finest.
Here in Volturmna, we have a tradition of hospitality. You must not deny
me. It's a point of honor."
</p>
<p>
Churinas led Melkart to private quarters in one of the palace's upper
floors. The rooms were broad and airy with their own shallow bath.
</p>
<p>
"Iole will serve you. She's pretty. Let me know if she's rude or
disobedient and I'll have her beaten."
</p>
<p>
Churinas left. Slaves bore amphorae filled with hot water into his quarters
shortly afterward. A silent, sullen, young woman in a plain, ragged tunica
with no mantle accompanied them. The men filled the tub. Melkart stripped
off his filthy kilt and got into the bath with a grunt of pleasure. The
woman poured pure olive oil over his body, scraped it off with a curved
strigil, then worked oil into his filthy hair. She poured several more
amphorae of tepid water over him.
</p>
<p>
Clean once again after a month’s long tramp, Melkart wrapped his loins in a
soft, white linen cloth and lay on the rope-slung bed. Wooden shutters kept
the bright light out, but still allowed a cool breeze through. He rested
his head on a contoured, upholstered wooden pillow and slipped into sleep.
When Melkart awoke, the setting sun glowed red through slanted shutters,
the last gasp of natural light. The young woman entered the room. She
carried fine garments of the purest white wool.
</p>
<p>
"Your toga and tunic, my lord."
</p>
<p>
"Melkart will do, girl. What's your name?"
</p>
<p>
"Iole. You should get dressed. The banquet will start soon."
</p>
<p>
Melkart pulled the soft tunic over his head and shoulders. Iole showed him
how to drape the toga over his enormous frame.
</p>
<p>
"This thing is a nuisance."
</p>
<p>
"You're not properly dressed for a banquet without it."
</p>
<p>
Iole took a small oil lamp and led him down the stairs and a dim corridor
to the Hall of Couches, a grand room with a high, barrel vault ceiling.
Walls and ceiling were covered with colorful, brilliant murals that
depicted the gods' battles, revels, and idylls, brightly lit by dozens of
smokeless castor oil lamps. Heated by an underground hypocaust, the
porphyry floor was marvelously warm under Melkart's sandaled feet. Eryx lay on a
gilded, upholstered couch. He dined in state with his sons who reclined on
their own luxurious couches. They wore purple edged togas and soft, red
leather shoes with curved, pointed toes.
</p>
<p>
Leaning on his left arm, Eryx indicated the couch on his right, the place
of honor. "Hurry, my dear boy. Take your place so the banquet can properly
start."
</p>
<p>
Melkart gingerly placed his bulk on the slender couch. He laid on his left
side and draped the hem of his toga over his head like the others. A slave
gave him a long handled silver spoon and a large linen napkin. Churinas
strode to the Hall's center and tapped his bejeweled ivory staff three
times upon the floor with great dramatic flair. A concealed orchestra took
up the beat. A water organ, twin flutes, and a horn played a sinuous,
tuneful melody with a tympanum and castanets for percussion. 
</p>
<p>
Young women entered the Hall. Bare-breasted, clad in gilt greaves, helmets,
and feathered Amazon skirts, they were armed with wooden spears and
shields. In an obscene travesty of martial valor, they performed the
Pyrrhic dance. Bent low, they formed a circle, shields high over their
heads, and slowly raised their spears to pierce pretended enemies. Melkart
impassively watched. A slave poured Melkart wine from a finely modeled,
black clay oinochoe. He sipped from his red and black krater only to wince.
</p>
<p>
"Iole. Fetch water to add to the wine."
</p>
<p>
"What's the matter, strong man?" Antagones said. "Pure wine too much for
you?" He was already very drunk.
</p>
<p>
"I like things in a civilized measure. At least two to one is considered
tolerable where I come from."
</p>
<p>
Iole poured spring water into his krater. Melkart swirled it around to mix
the water and wine. He smiled. Iole smiled back. Antagones nudged Phobis
and pointed with a wide grin.
</p>
<p>
"Do they treat slaves like ladies in your land too?"
</p>
<p>
Melkart calmly drank his watered wine. "As I said, my lord, I'm a common
herdsman. I have no right to look down on anyone."
</p>
<p>
"My, how admirable you are, Melkart," Eryx said. "Big and handsome as a
god, and yet you still know your place. I wish all my subjects had your
deferential attitude. But you must be hungry. Churinas."
</p>
<p>
The steward tapped his cane again. The dancers left. The orchestra played
on, low and subdued so not to interfere with conversation. Sterling silver
salvers were brought out by slaves, loaded down with a whole roast goat,
wild boar meat in pomegranate sauce, and charred, massive beef chunks.
Melkart reached out with his long spoon and ate heavily.
</p>
<p>
"Make sure our guest has more wine, Churinas. It's the finest Falernian."
</p>
<p>
The steward refilled Melkart's krater. Iole added water without being told.
Antagones reached out to grab her as she passed, but Iole neatly
sidestepped him. Melkart frowned.
</p>
<p>
"Melkart, that herd of yours. How many head have you got? I mean, just as a
guess," Eryx said.
</p>
<p>
"I know every cow, my lord, all three hundred and twelve, from Serapis, the
guide bull, to the newest calf."
</p>
<p>
"Why wouldn't you? After all, they're your only companions."
</p>
<p>
"Quiet, Antagones. I'm talking business. What would you say if I offered a
gold talent for an even hundred?"
</p>
<p>
Melkart gave Eryx a puzzled look. "My lord, I'm under a bond and must
deliver these cattle to my master, Toqeph, Lord of Byblos and Tyre. I
either bring the cattle to him or die."
</p>
<p>
Eryx leaned close to Melkart. He spoke in a low, level tone, his manner
confidential, an older man imparting sound, hard earned wisdom to a younger
one.
</p>
<p>
"That's far from here. You'll probably lose that many cattle or more by the
time you get there. Toqeph has no way of knowing if you leave some behind.
I'll make you a rich man for life."
</p>
<p>
"What's wrong with you, Melkart? Are you such a stupid paganus you can't
see a lifetime's opportunity?"
</p>
<p>
"I said I'd handle this, Phobis. Melkart, I know you're not just strong,
but you've got a good head on your shoulders too. All I ask is less than a
third of your herd and I'm willing to pay far more than they're worth. Why
do you object?"
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled ruefully. "Because they're not mine to sell. If you don't
mind my asking, my lord, why do you want these cattle so much? I saw any
number of fat milch cows on the way here. Aren't they enough?"
</p>
<p>
Voluble until now, Eryx suddenly turned reticent. He broke eye contact,
hemmed and hawed.
</p>
<p>
"Well, you see, we've had some difficulties of late. The pagani have
complained about stillborn, two headed foals this spring, although it's
really no more than usual. And the haruspices have pointed out a few ill
omens lately, birds flying at dawn from the northeast quadrant, snakes
writhing in a heap where three roads cross, that sort of thing. They've
consulted the libri ostentaria, but-"
</p>
<p>
"For Laran's sake, Pater, get to the point," Antagones said. "There's a
fire breathing, giant monster named Cacus that rampages at night, and he
kills and eats women and children."
</p>
<p>
"We need those cattle to make a sacrifice to appease Tin so he'll go away,"
Phobis said, angry as his brother.
</p>
<p>
"A hecatomb is the appropriate ritual for this situation," Eryx said. "So
you see logic and profit only dictate one result."
</p>
<p>
"But, my lord, why does Cacus harry Volturmna? Surely some terrible sin
against the gods must have occurred. Why else would a monster be sent to
murder women and children?"
</p>
<p>
"You'll find as you grow older, Melkart, that the gods are often arbitrary.
I mean no disrespect, far from it, for am I not chief haruspex, but perhaps
some junior haruspex erred in his recital of the vesper services. Fate
often turns on seemingly little things like that."
</p>
<p>
"The important thing is, we need to get rid of Cacus. Now are you going to
sell those cattle or not?" Phobis said.
</p>
<p>
Melkart sipped from his krater. "I have a better idea. Why don't I go out
tomorrow to wherever this monster Cacus lives and just capture or kill him?
That will solve your problem without getting the cattle involved at all."
</p>
<p>
Phobis and Antagones burst into loud, derisive laughter. They rolled about
until they nearly fell from their couches.
</p>
<p>
"Kill or capture Cacus? Are you completely mad? He's five cubits high, as
broad as the Lion Gate, and he spits flames from his mouth. He'll eat you
alive," Antagones said.
</p>
<p>
"Then you'll have the whole herd and can sacrifice as many as you like.
Give me your solemn bond as my host, Lord Eryx, you'll let me and the herd
pass on if I bring Cacus back dead or alive."
</p>
<p>
Eryx reached over and slapped Melkart lightly on a rocklike thigh.
</p>
<p>
"By the Pantheon, I'll take you up on that offer. Cacus lurks on the
Colline Mount, two leagues from here."
</p>
<p>
"I'll need a strong horse then."
</p>
<p>
"And you shall have him, my best mount."
</p>
<p>
"I suppose you want guards to accompany you," Phobis said. "You can't
possibly take him on alone."
</p>
<p>
"No, you're right. I'll bring Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
Eryx and his sons stared at Melkart in mute incomprehension, stunned by his
nonchalance. Melkart set down his krater. He stood up and stretched long,
muscular arms.
</p>
<p>
"I should get some sleep if Cacus is such a hard nut to crack. And I need
to check on Kaleb and the herd anyway. So I'll bid you and your sons good
night, my lord."
</p>
<p>
He bowed and walked off. Antagones and Phobis stared daggers at him as he
left.
</p>
<p>
"Did you see how rude that paganus was?" Antagones hissed once Melkart was
out of earshot. "All those impertinent questions instead of just doing what
he's told."
</p>
<p>
"Really. Let's kill him tonight and take the cattle for ourselves. Big as
he is, a well-placed dagger in his sleep will lay him low."
</p>
<p>
"And what if you miss?" Eryx said. "No, what our foreign friend proposed
sounds eminently reasonable. Certainly he's no stranger to violence. He
either kills Cacus and rids us of a horrible scourge, or he dies and we have
his cattle to sell, trade, and sacrifice. By Tin, Cel, and Uni, why did I
sire two thoughtless hotheads? Now are you going to behave yourselves?"
</p>
<p>
He bellowed the last question. Still cowed by their overbearing father,
both young men nodded. Eryx laid back on his couch.
</p>
<p>
"That's better. Send the dancing girls back. This has been a long day. It's
about time we took our togas off."
</p>
<p>
Melkart found Kaleb and the herd fed and well. Kaleb stood with his front
paws on Melkart's shoulders and frantically licked his face.
</p>
<p>
"Easy, boy. We hunt tomorrow, just you and me."
</p>
<p>
He reentered Tarquinia and returned to the palace. Aside from loud, drunken
screams from the Hall of Couches, everyone else was in bed. The halls were
shrouded in darkness. Melkart went to his quarters alone by an oil lamp's
tiny light. When he entered the bedroom, he heard faint breathing.
</p>
<p>
Iole lay naked on the bed, a frightened, apprehensive look on her face. She
was beautiful, but her arms and legs were bruised.
</p>
<p>
"Churinas said I must lie with you."
</p>
<p>
Melkart set the oil lamp on a bronze tripod. He draped his lionskin over
the petite girl, bronze face graced by compassion.
</p>
<p>
"Be calm, Iole. I am Melkart. I take advantage of no one, slave or free."
</p>
<p>
She smiled radiantly. Melkart gently stroked her dirty hair. He removed his
tunic, blew out the lamp, lay next to Iole, and immediately went to sleep.
Happy for the first time in years, safe by the hulking stranger, Iole
cuddled next to his protective bulk and soon drifted off herself.

<p class=drop>Iole woke Melkart before dawn. He put on his freshly clean kilt and washed
his face and beard in a pewter basin. Melkart broke his fast with porridge
in hot goat's milk and dried figs that Iole fetched him. Melkart ate the
large bowl of porridge to the last spoonful.
</p>
<p>
"You take good care of me."
</p>
<p>
Iole smiled again. She had a full set of even, regular, white teeth.
</p>
<p>
"A man your size needs to eat."
</p>
<p>
Melkart regarded Iole, curiosity alive in his black eyes. "You weren't born
a slave. You're too well bred."
</p>
<p>
Iole looked away. She wore Tragedy's mask. "No. I wasn't always a slave.
You'd better hurry. Phobis awaits you outside the Lion Gate."
</p>
<p>
"Hmm. That worm. What about Erisus and the other runt, Antonocles?"
</p>
<p>
Iole laughed outright to hear Melkart speak so of her lords and masters.
</p>
<p>
"It's Eryx and Antagones. They both had too much raw wine last night and
they're in bed, eating cabbage until their hangovers go away."
</p>
<p>
Melkart's booming laugh resounded. Iole stilled him with two white fingers
to his lips.
</p>
<p>
"Shhh. You'll wake everyone in Tarquinia. Your voice would shake Tin from
his throne in the sky."
</p>
<p>
Melkart nodded. "You're right, Iole. I shouldn't be rude. I won't keep
Photis waiting."
</p>
<p>
Iole giggled, liquid, tinkling silver. "It's Phobis."
</p>
<p>
"Barbar barbar. Who cares what his name is. I want to see this terrible
monster. Take care, Iole. Astarte keep you. I'll see you before twilight."
</p>
<p>
"Be careful. Cacus is an awful monster. Every night, he breaks into some
poor paganus's hut to steal a child or a woman for his dinner."
</p>
<p>
"We'll see about that. I'm not a child or a woman. I'll bring him back,
either whole or just his head if he gets difficult."
</p>
<p>
Melkart stood up. He tied his lionskin around his waist and gathered his
arms. With enormous strides, Melkart went to the Lion Gate. The guards
bowed low with newfound respect as he passed through, awed any man would
even think to take on the dreaded Cacus alone. Wrapped in a scarlet cloak
against the early morning spring cold, Phobis paced back and forth outside
the walls. The cloak's edges waved in the stiff wind. Four grooms struggled
to hold a giant, saddled black stallion.
</p>
<p>
"There you are," said Phobis, "I'm not used to waiting on some paganus. It's supposed to
be the other way around. I hope that whore Iole was to your satisfaction
last night. She's the last woman you'll ever lie with. Are you ready to be
eaten? Let's see you even mount Lupu. He won't let anyone but my Pater on
him."
</p>
<p>
A head taller than Phobis, Melkart smiled tolerantly. "Even for a
barbarian, you're rude and ill-bred. I'll buy Iole from your father upon my
return and manumit her. As for this poor horse, you don't know how to treat
him, just like human beings."
</p>
<p>
Melkart slowly approached Lupu. He let the horse smell him, grow accustomed
to his presence.
</p>
<p>
"Let him go."
</p>
<p>
"He'll bolt," a groom protested.
</p>
<p>
"He won't. Let him loose."
</p>
<p>
The grooms released the horse and hurriedly backed away. Melkart put his
hands out, palms upward. He made gentle clicking sounds. To everyone's
astonishment, rather than bolt or trample him, Lupu nuzzled Melkart with
his huge head. Melkart embraced the horse, stroked his mane, thick and
black as his own dark hair. Right hand on the saddle, Melkart vaulted onto
Lupu. The powerful stallion took his weight without complaint.
</p>
<p>
"I'll need a rope."
</p>
<p>
"What for?"
</p>
<p>
"To bind the monster."
</p>
<p>
Phobis laughed. "There's no end to your hubris, is there?"
</p>
<p>
"Just give me a rope."
</p>
<p>
"All right. Guard. Fetch a rope from the stable."
</p>
<p>
A guard hurried inside the walls and soon returned with a coiled hempen
rope. Melkart tied the rope to the saddle.
</p>
<p>
"You said you wanted your dog," Phobis said. "He's still inside the stock
pen. The vicious beast won't let anyone near him."
</p>
<p>
"He won't let barbarians approach." Melkart put two fingers to his mouth
and emitted a shrill, loud whistle.
</p>
<p>
An answering chorus of barks and yelps. The tread of swift paws. Kaleb
leapt over the gates of the pen with a soaring bound, eye whites prominent as
he ran toward his master. He rested his front paws on Melkart's right foot
and licked his outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>
"How touching. Cacus lives in a cave halfway up the Colline Mount. Just
follow the rising sun for two leagues. You can't miss the mountain. There's
a trail of bones and skulls up the slope. I bet my half of the kingdom you
and your dog just ride on. We'll feast well off your herd."
</p>
<p>
"Lucky for you I want no part of your kingdom. You and your brother are
both barbarians and fools. I'll return before twilight."
</p>
<p>
Melkart put his heels to Lupu's flanks. The horse loped away. Kaleb easily
kept pace. He barked with delight at being with Melkart. They galloped
toward the ascending sun as the red orb gained in size and power. Melkart
sat astride the charging horse, great bow slung over one shoulder, armed
and ready.
</p>
<p>
The landscape gently flowed and ebbed, verdant, sloping fields and olive
groves edged by hills, like the folds of a carelessly dropped green cloak.
Farmhouses, barns, and stables stood empty. Panicked local pagani had
hurriedly packed up their families, rounded up their livestock, and fled
from Cacus long ago. Melkart slowed Lupu to a steady, brisk trot. Bright
blue birds flitted among neglected wheat fields in an endless, circling
harvest of rust colored dragonflies. A brown hare dashed across the road.
Kaleb let out a deep, throaty yelp and lunged after him.
</p>
<p>
"Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
Shamefaced under his master's stern gaze, Kaleb returned to the road and
followed Lupu. The road steadily ascended. Open fields and farmsteads gave
way to a thick beech tree forest that yielded in turn a band of spiny
needled pines. The air grew cold. Melkart put his lionskin over his
shoulders. Trees slowly gave way to barren, oddly shaped, sandy cones, like
the stone tents of some primordial tribe, long dead for eons. Above the
conical hills, the Colline Mount rose high into the clouds.
</p>
<p>
Melkart stopped and chopped a dead pine down with his short sword. He tied
the tree with rope to the saddle, mounted up, and urged Lupu onward.
Gentled by Melkart's kindness, Lupu willingly pulled the extra load. The
tree's brown needles hissed over stones as the horse dragged it upward.
</p>
<p>
The path wound through the strange conical hills. A long, yellow femur lay
on the path, picked clean by kites and buzzards. Kaleb paused to sniff at
the bone, but Melkart hissed at him to follow. Other bones lay on the path.
They became more frequent as they ascended. In his greedy haste to devour
his prey, Cacus had gnawed and torn at their bodies as he hurried to his
lair, only to heedlessly toss half finished remains away. Ribcages littered
the way, a child's small skull with a patch of long haired scalp, long
bones snapped in two to suck out the raw marrow.
</p>
<p>
They reached the base of Colline Mount. The mountain's colossal, bare gray
stones towered high above them. Scattered bones lay at irregular intervals
on the winding path to a small plateau halfway up the slope. There was a
jagged black hole, a cave's mouth. Bones and skulls littered the grassy
plateau.
</p>
<p>
Melkart dismounted. He stroked Lupu's mane and blew in his ear.
</p>
<p>
"Wait here. Be quiet like a good boy."
</p>
<p>
Melkart untied the rope and picked up the tree. He headed toward the cave,
Kaleb behind him, both silent as they made their way up the stony path.
Melkart held the dead pine high, careful not to brush against any stones.
At the plateau's edge, he ducked low. Kaleb crouched, ears cocked back,
snout flared, long fangs bared. He let out a growl, but Melkart hushed him.
</p>
<p>
There was an enormous, guttural roar, a sucking gasp like a desperate, last
attempt to breathe, only to be followed by another spasm, louder and more
stertorous than the one before. Sated by his latest feast of raw human
meat, Cacus lay in his primitive lair and snored, insensate after his
gluttonous orgy.
</p>
<p>
Melkart took out a flint and iron from his bag. He turned his back to
shield them from the light wind and struck the flint against the iron,
deftly and repeatedly. A shower of bright sparks soon ignited the pine's
bone dry needles. Pitch saturated branches caught fire also. Thick, gray
black smoke burgeoned from the tree. Melkart picked the burning pine up by
the trunk and deftly hurled it into the cave.
</p>
<p>
The snores continued while smoke poured from the cave's mouth. They
suddenly ceased.
</p>
<p>
"AAAAAAIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE."
</p>
<p>
An awful scream, worse than any Melkart had ever heard from a wounded beast
or man, a cry of pain mingled with livid outrage that anyone could commit
such a foul act. The flaming tree shot out of the cave.
</p>
<p>
"Down, Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
Melkart and his dog flattened themselves beneath the plateau's edge. A
giant, naked monster ran out from the cave. More beast than man, hairy to
the point of shagginess, he bared long fangs in a hideous face and
let loose with a fiery blast, a torrent of flames that reduced everything
in its path to blackened cinders.
</p>
<p>
The fire passed harmlessly over their heads. Momentarily drained, Cacus
gasped for air. Melkart rose to his feet. An arrow already nocked, he drew
back the bowstring and fired so swiftly and smoothly as to be almost
instantaneous. A goosefeather-fletched shaft sailed straight and true. The
sharp iron arrowhead landed in Cacus's left shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"UUUUNNNNGGGGHHH."
</p>
<p>
Cacus reached up and yanked the arrow out with a gout of blood and tissue.
He angrily threw the arrow down, but Kaleb had raced across the plateau by
leaps and bounds and was already upon him. The black hound yapped and
snarled at Cacus while he tore at the giant's calves and ankles. Cacus drew
back his right leg. He sent Kaleb flying with a ferocious kick. Kaleb hit
the ground hard. Not even fazed, the dog leapt up and furiously sped toward
Cacus, eager to rejoin the fray.
</p>
<p>
Before Kaleb could attack Cacus once again, Melkart ran up to the monster.
Cacus punched at Melkart, wild, roundhouse swings that would have surely
killed him if they landed, but Melkart smoothly dodged his blows. He landed
a hard left fist in Cacus's stomach. The buffet doubled the giant over, head
thrown back from the blow's force, chin wide open, an easy target.
</p>
<p>
Melkart brought his right fist up from the waist and landed an uppercut
square on the point of Cacus's chin. Cacus landed flat on his back from the
blow, a dazed look in his feral eyes. Kaleb grabbed Cacus by the throat and
pinned him. Melkart picked up a large stone and fell on Cacus as well. They
thrashed about in a confused, brawling mess. Melkart and Kaleb worked
together to harry Cacus into submission. Melkart belabored Cacus about the
head with the sharp stone until his thick brown locks were soaked with
blood. Cacus kicked and threw himself about all the while. Desperate to
bite his attackers, he ferociously gnashed his fanged teeth.
</p>
<p>
Melkart raised the rock high. He brought it down hard. There was a loud
crack. Cacus lay still, mouth slack, eyelids closed, finally knocked
unconscious. Shaking, Melkart and Kaleb rose, staggered away from Cacus,
and fell to the ground. Man and dog gasped for air, spent by their grueling
effort.
</p>
<p>
Melkart sat up, then got to his feet. He took the rope, went to Cacus, and
tied him from head to foot with triple knotted bonds. When he was sure the
monster was securely restrained, Melkart cut a short piece of rope and
gagged Cacus tightly. He searched Cacus's smoky lair and found a crude
wooden table where the monster had his vile repasts. Melkart dragged the
table outside and broke it up into planks with his bare hands. With other
short lengths of rope, he fashioned a travois with his lionskin as a cover.
</p>
<p>
Melkart manhandled Cacus onto the travois. Although big, Cacus wasn't quite
as tall as Antagones had claimed. Melkart dragged the travois down the
slope to where Lupu awaited. Lupu snorted and grew restive at the sight and
smell of Cacus, but made no move to bolt. Melkart backed him up to the
travois and secured the two long planks to the saddle with the last of the
rope.
</p>
<p>
"Come on, boy. Pull. Get up."
</p>
<p>
Lupu dragged the travois down the path. Melkart followed behind. He lifted
the travois over large stones and helped the horse pull through rough
patches. They made slow but continuous progress. The sun was still just
short of its zenith when they left the forest and reached the relatively
level Volturmnine plain. Melkart halted Lupu at the first farm he
encountered. He untied the travois, set it down, and checked Cacus. The
monster was still insensate, his breathing ragged but steady.
</p>
<p>
"Watch him, Kaleb."
</p>
<p>
Melkart ran to the barn and returned pulling a two wheeled cart by the
shafts.
</p>
<p>
"Now we'll make real progress. Back up, Lupu."
</p>
<p>
Melkart harnessed Lupu to the shafts. He picked Cacus up, draped the giant
over his shoulder, and dumped him into the cart with one terrific heave.
The cart groaned under Cacus's weight, but was sturdy enough to hold him.
His burden now sharply reduced, Lupu willingly pulled the cart. The
ungreased axle creaked and whined, but the road to Tarquinia was well paved
and smooth. Melkart urged Lupu on. The horse trotted down the road. Melkart
and Kaleb easily kept pace.
</p>
<p>
A broad stream was crossed by a narrow crescent shaped bridge. As the cart
rattled over the stone bridge, two swineherds herded their pigs toward the
stream to water on the opposite bank.
</p>
<p>
"Ohe, giant. What's in the cart? A wild ox you killed?" the older one
cried, grizzled face alive with curiosity.
</p>
<p>
"Cacus."
</p>
<p>
The swineherd dropped his crook, few teeth stark in an open, gaping mouth.
</p>
<p>
"The monster. You mean to say you've saved us?"
</p>
<p>
Melkart only hurried on with the cart. The swineherd picked up his crook.
He turned to his young son.
</p>
<p>
"Metie, lad. Run and tell everyone the news. I'll mind the pigs. Hurry."
</p>
<p>
Metie ran off. The good tidings soon spread far and wide. Sturdy tillers of
the soil cast their plows aside and left oxen untended in the fields to run
toward the road with their wives and children to catch a glimpse of Melkart
and his captive. People flocked to both sides of the road. Unbidden, they
followed the cart, laughing and singing. The air was filled with hosannas
and hallelujahs as hymns of praise were sung. A young girl ran up to
Melkart with a quickly fashioned laurel wreath, the traditional victor's
tribute. Melkart graciously paused to don the wreath. The pagani wildly
cheered and raised their right hands in the two fingered sign of blessing.
</p>
<p class=drop>Word had spread to Tarquinia long before Melkart's arrival a little before
twilight. Eryx stood before the Lion Gate with Antagones and Phobis,
attired in regal robes, the gods' attire, the toga imperatoria, blue and
adorned with a golden sun, moon, and stars. They wore golden radiate crowns
and were accompanied by guards in burnished bronze cuirasses. Eryx's open
delight seemed unfeigned.
</p>
<p>
"Greetings, Melkart. You're indeed a man of your word. What you set out to
do, you accomplish. Here's Cacus, scourge of Volturmna, feared by all,
brought before us a bound captive. My sons, here's a hero to emulate."
</p>
<p>
"I see you brought most of the countryside along too," Phobis said. "Clear
out," he shouted. "Get back to your hovels, pagani."
</p>
<p>
"Guards," Antagones said. "See them off."
</p>
<p>
The guard formed ranks, raised their shields, and reversed spears. They
drove the pagani away from Tarquinia with wooden shafts. Melkart watched,
but said nothing.
</p>
<p>
"As you said, Lord Eryx, I've kept my promise. I'll set out with the herd
tomorrow. I thank you once again for your hospitality. All I ask of you for
my service is one favor."
</p>
<p>
Eryx laughed.
</p>
<p>
"Friend Melkart, what's your hurry? A hero deserves thanks for his feat;
the deliverer must have his homage. A great feast is being prepared. Can't
you smell the sides of beef and wild boar roasting? That and the finest
Opimian and Falernian await, along with new robes, a soft, comfortable
couch, and dancing girls. You can't deny me. We can talk about business and
anything else you like in the Hall of Couches. Any boon you seek, rest
assured I'll grant it, but only at the banquet, where kindness and
hospitality rule. Please don't refuse."
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled. "I would never refuse a banquet. But what about Cacus? He
needs watching."
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry about the monster," Phobis said. "We've got plans for him."
</p>
<p>
"He'll be in good hands, I can assure you," Eryx said. "The guards will
look after him. You must be tired and dirty. Bathe in your quarters. Iole,
the slave girl you like, will attend you. Rest. You're my guest."
</p>
<p>
Lupu was unharnessed. Guards pulled the cart inside the city walls to
confine Cacus in an earthen cell for sacrificial victims, deep underneath
the temple. Melkart brushed Lupu down in his stall and fed him a double
ration of oats. He had the palace cook give Kaleb a thick, red slab of raw
beef and left the dog to happily devour it in the kitchen. Melkart went to
the livestock pens to check on the cattle, did a careful head count, and was
satisfied to find none missing. A slave led him to his quarters. Iole
awaited, clad in a new, white linen tunica with a blue, glass bead
necklace. She bowed low to Melkart, her smile wide, open, honest.
</p>
<p>
"Lord Melkart. You've returned as you vowed with Cacus subdued. You're
greater than any man in the valley."
</p>
<p>
Melkart gently embraced Iole and kissed her lightly. "None of this 'Lord'
business, girl. Plain Melkart will do. Now I want my bath."
</p>
<p>
He lifted her up and spun her around in the air. She squealed with delight.
Melkart set Iole down. He stripped and got into the shallow tub. Iole
bathed him once again with hot water and olive oil, only this time
joyfully, happy to scrub and pamper Melkart.
</p>
<p>
"I see you've put on your finest. Is that for my benefit?"
</p>
<p>
"The Rex has ordered a festival. Everyone in the household has been given
new clothes to wear for tomorrow's celebration."
</p>
<p>
Melkart got out of the tub. Iole stood on tiptoes to drape a towel over his
broad shoulders.
</p>
<p>
"New clothes suit you well, Iole."
</p>
<p>
Iole shot a fearful glance toward the entryway. Reassured no one spied on
them, she stood close and whispered conspiratorially.
</p>
<p>
"Be on your guard. Eryx and his sons are treacherous. Be wary at the
banquet. Watch what you eat and drink. Phobis is a master poisoner. They'll
stop at nothing to have their way."
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled. Teeth and the whites of his eyes flashed brilliantly in the
gathering twilight.
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry about Erisus."
</p>
<p>
"It's Eryx."
</p>
<p>
"Barbar."
</p>
<p>
Iole giggled, but put her hand over her mouth.
</p>
<p>
"Won't you please be serious? You're impossible."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind that puffed up hill chieftain and his two nasty brats. Even if
I don't say their barbarian names right, I can still eat them alive."
</p>
<p>
"I know you're big and strong, but please be careful, Melkart. I'm begging
you."
</p>
<p>
Her pleas cut him like the tears that streamed down her face. Melkart dried
her eyes with a toga hem and gently stroked her hair.
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry, Iole. I'll be on my guard. I swear by Marduk Sky Father. I
can't make a more solemn oath than that."
</p>
<p>
Iole favored Melkart with a weak smile. She pulled herself together and
became her usual businesslike self again.
</p>
<p>
"You should get dressed. He'll be expecting you."
</p>
<p>
"Who?"
</p>
<p>
"You know. Erisus."
</p>
<p>
They both laughed. Melkart put on a loincloth and pulled on another clean,
white wool tunic. Iole helped him don the toga, white like the previous
one, but with a brilliant, thin purple stripe along the edge.
</p>
<p>
"It's a special mark of honor."
</p>
<p>
"I still say it's a damned nuisance."
</p>
<p>
Churinas entered. "Lord Melkart, the Rex awaits. Stupid, inattentive girl.
Why didn't you fetch the Lord to the Hall of Couches?"
</p>
<p>
He raised his hand to strike Iole, but Melkart grabbed him by the wrist.
</p>
<p>
"I don't like you, Churinas. Get out, you obsequious weasel."
</p>
<p>
He turned Churinas by his wrist and kicked him hard. Churinas
hurriedly fled.
</p>
<p>
"You shouldn't have done that. He's very powerful."
</p>
<p>
"He's a toady. From tomorrow, you'll have nothing to fear from him or
anyone else."
</p>
<p>
"You'd better go to the Hall before Churinas tells some story about you."
</p>
<p>
Iole picked up an oil lamp to lead Melkart to the Hall of Couches, but
Melkart took it from her.
</p>
<p>
"Stay here instead. I know the way well enough. I've seen what Circean
swine they become once they drink unwatered wine. I don't want you exposed
to that. I'm going to have Eryx manumit you, set you free. Then you can
either stay here or come with me, your choice."
</p>
<p>
Iole cried out with joy and delight. She ran to Melkart and hugged him,
then backed away to straighten his toga folds.
</p>
<p>
"Melkart, I'll follow you to the Hesperides and beyond. I'm your slave."
</p>
<p>
Melkart bent low and kissed Iole on the forehead. "No, girl. You'll never
be a slave again."
</p>
<p>
He walked down the stairs and took the corridor to the Hall of Couches.
Melkart walked into a confused, chaotic scene. The orchestra was in full
swing, a strange, barbarous piece, with odd beats and wailing horns. Dancing
girls swayed about the hall stark naked but for brilliant blue and green
cloaks. They formed a lurching, lewd saraband, eyes wide and blank on some
strange herb, with occasional pauses for varied concupiscent combinations.
The air was thick with burning myrrh's sharp scent. Eryx and his sons lay
on their couches in their regal robes, heads undraped, instead adorned with
the golden radiate crowns. They were already quite drunk, faces split by
wide, complacent smiles.
</p>
<p>
"The guest of honor," Eryx shouted. "We've been waiting for you. Where've
you been? Did you use Iole again? You should. You deserve it. And a whole
lot more. Come lie on the couch of honor."
</p>
<p>
"Yes. You're really a good fellow after all," Phobis said. "You did us an
important favor. I'm sorry I was rude. Please take your place as our
honored guest."
</p>
<p>
His words plainly rehearsed beforehand, Phobis bared rabbit teeth in a
smile, but his eyes still radiated hate. Melkart smiled in turn and lay on
his couch. He was about to drape the edge of his toga over his head when
Eryx restrained his hand.
</p>
<p>
"We hold celestial court tonight, just like Tin in the heavens. What better
way to treat a hero, surely the son of some god? You needn't cover your
head tonight. Instead, wear the victor's due, Apulu's crown."
</p>
<p>
A handsome young boy handed Melkart a crown of golden laurel leaves,
cunningly fashioned by master smiths. Melkart donned the crown. Yellow
leaves' sharp tips faintly pricked his temples. He put his right hand to
his heart, and bowed his head.
</p>
<p>
"Again, my lord, you honor me more than I deserve."
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense. Now that you're here, let's eat."
</p>
<p>
Food in ridiculous quantities was served, plainly cherished delicacies to
Eryx and his sons, but mostly barbarian dishes not to Melkart's taste,
boiled sow's belly smothered in rancid fish sauce, roast dormice on
skewers, and whole, tiny birds plucked featherless, rolled in bread crumbs,
and deep fried in olive oil. The dancers continued their lascivious antics.
They gave Melkart many long, sighing gazes, open invitations to rut he
coolly disregarded.
</p>
<p>
"Try some chilled Opimian. It's what I'm drinking. Fill my krater too,
slave."
</p>
<p>
A slave poured wine from a pot bellied psykter, previously placed inside a
snow packed hydria to chill. Melkart waited for Eryx to drink first. He
sipped the cold, unwatered wine and fought to hold back a grimace. The
bitter red wine was incredibly strong. He beckoned for a slave to add
water. He closely watched Eryx and his sons and was careful to eat only
from dishes they had already tasted. The golden laurel crown sat
uncomfortably on his head, scratched and itched his scalp.
</p>
<p>
The hall seemed to shrink around him; the incense smell grew overpowering.
The orchestra's frantic music irritated Melkart's usually sanguine
disposition. He found his attention straying as his mind wandered into
emptiness. Melkart shook his head and looked around him. Antagones loudly
laughed.
</p>
<p>
"Is a sip of Opimian enough to make you drunk, Melkart?"
</p>
<p>
"An overgrown paganus like Melkart needs some red meat to bring him round,"
Phobis said. "Isn't that right, Pater? Don't you think it's time we had
them bring out the centerpiece?"
</p>
<p>
Eryx considered briefly. "Yes, this does seem auspicious. Melkart, we want
to honor you for bringing in the monster who terrified the valley for so
long-"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, come on, Pater, stop blathering. I'm hungry," Antagones said.
</p>
<p>
Eryx smiled indulgently. "Ah, the impatience of youth. Wait until they
reach man's estate, eh, Melkart? But without further ado, in your honor, a
traditional Rasennan dish."
</p>
<p>
Churinas sharply clapped his hands three times. Four muscular slaves
carried in a small litter, weighed down by a heavy burden concealed under a
red cloth. The slaves set the litter down on the table before Melkart and
bowed low. Three departed while the remaining slave put a hand to the cloth
and looked toward his master. Eryx nodded approval. The slave snatched the
cloth away.
</p>
<p>
Serapis's severed head sat on a massive silver salver, skinned, roasted,
and coated in aspic, a yellow quince in his mouth and bronze bells on the
horns' tips. Melkart's eyes went wide. Teeth bared in an awful snarl, he
leapt to his feet.
</p>
<p>
"You break the rules of hospitality, slaughter Serapis, and insult me, your
guest? I'll kill every single one of you and your servants this night."
</p>
<p>
Melkart reached for the slave who turned to flee just a moment too late. He
snatched the slave up with both hands, held him high over his head, and
threw him. The slave sailed through the air only to crash full into
Antagones's chest, a blow that knocked the princeling flat to the floor and
left him gasping.
</p>
<p>
Melkart turned a couch over and ripped off a leg for use as an impromptu
club. He brandished it high in a blood fury, only to have the strength in
his legs go out from under him. Melkart swayed back and forth. The hall
reeled around him. His hands went to his sides. The club fell harmlessly to
the floor. Distorted faces swam into view. Eryx and Phobis leered as they
drank wine and laughed at his plight.
</p>
<p>
"I can't believe he's still on his feet. How much adder venom did you put
on the wreath?"
</p>
<p>
"Pater, I know what I'm doing. It's just this paganus is so damn large.
Maybe he needs a little help. This should do it."
</p>
<p>
Phobis reached out and shoved Melkart hard. He crashed to the floor
unconscious. Golden leaves cut his skin. Thin trails of red blood trickled
down his face onto the porphyry floor.
</p>

<p class=drop>Melkart came to with a splitting headache. He was in a subterranean cell,
chained by the neck to a stone wall. The cell had a small open window, set
high in the outer wall with a single iron bar to prevent escape. A faint,
ghostly column of moonbeam provided scant light. Melkart looked around the
cell. What appeared to be a pile of rags in a corner suddenly stirred. A
battered, honest face reared up from the pile.
</p>
<p>
"So you woke up. Now I'll have some company, that is, at least until they
come for us."
</p>
<p>
"Where are we?"
</p>
<p>
"Under the guard house, just by the gate. Don't bother to shout. They
ignore you. I can't count how many times I passed this place without a
care, headed toward the forum to do some business, never knowing I'd end up
here just for obeying that whoreson Aule."
</p>
<p>
"What's your name?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm Thresu of the Luceres. I saw you with your herd when you entered the
valley. Aule the headman told me to run to Tarquinia and let them know. I
stuck around, hoping for a copper as a reward, and do you know what
happened? That rotten bastard Churinas slapped my face. Then he had the
guards beat me and put me here."
</p>
<p>
"They're vicious even for barbarians."
</p>
<p>
Thresu got up, pulled his torn tunic around him, and sat next to Melkart.
</p>
<p>
"I have to agree, even though they're my own people. Now we're both for it,
once Thesan streaks the sky."
</p>
<p>
"What's going to happen?"
</p>
<p>
"We're both to be put to death in the morning before the altar as human
sacrifices to Tin. I'll just have my throat cut since I'm only a paganus,
but they're going to make you fight that monster Cacus and then kill
whoever wins. Then they'll sacrifice all your cattle in a triple hecatomb."
</p>
<p>
"And how do you know this, trapped in this cell?"
</p>
<p>
"Guards told me when they dragged you in and chained you. Said how much
they're looking forward to seeing me get it, the miserable swine."
</p>
<p>
Melkart silently mulled over Thresu's words.
</p>
<p>
"I understand these evil men mean us harm, Thresu, but what's the point of
all this? If they want me dead and to have my cattle, why not just kill me
when they drugged me unconscious? The same for Cacus. Why risk letting him
loose?"
</p>
<p>
"Eryx is desperate to escape Tin's curse. He thinks if he makes enough
offerings, Tin will forgive him and let him sacrifice in the temple again."
</p>
<p>
"Why did the god curse him?"
</p>
<p>
"He murdered his brother Evandrus the Rex at sacrifice, in the temple
before Tin's image, so he could become Rex. In his death agony, Tin spoke
through Evandrus. He cursed Eryx and all of Volturmna and sent Cacus to
torment us for the blood guilt of Evandrus."
</p>
<p>
Melkart's scowl was visible even in near darkness. "Fratricide before the
Sky Father himself? Blasphemy. Anathema. Is there no end to the infamy
here?"
</p>
<p>
Thresu shook his head. "They're Kharun's children, the lot of them. Eryx
took his own niece, Iole, after he murdered her pater and made her a slave,
turned her over to the guards to break her in."
</p>
<p>
"By the gods, such vile crimes can't go unpunished. I made an oath this
night to slaughter Eryx and his foul brood. As you are my witness, Thresu,
before the sun sets on the morrow, I'll fulfill that vow."
</p>
<p>
Thresu laughed, then clapped both hands over his mouth. "I'm sorry, friend,
but we're trapped down here. There's no way to escape. You're chained up.
You might as well face it. Come the dawn, you and I will go under Kharun's
hook."
</p>
<p>
"We'll see about that. I'm starting to feel more like my usual self."
</p>
<p>
Melkart got to his feet. He grabbed the chain with both hands and gave an
exploratory pull.
</p>
<p>
"You'll never budge it. It's bolted to the wall."
</p>
<p>
"Probably at least a century ago. Let me brace myself."
</p>
<p>
Melkart stood close to the wall, braced his feet against it, and pulled on
the chain. Veins bulged forth on his arms, chest, and neck. There was an
audible groan from the wall. Melkart paused to catch his breath.
</p>
<p>
"Cel's bones, you're strong. What do they feed you in your country, whole
cows?"
</p>
<p>
Melkart chuckled. He put his feet to the wall again, took in a deep breath,
and exhaled heavily while he pulled even harder than before. A metallic
shriek of protest and the four bolts gave way. The plate that bolted the
chain to the wall came loose.
</p>
<p>
"All right, Melkart. Good work there. You're still trapped in this cell."
</p>
<p>
"You're right, Thresu. But you won't be, not for long, now I can move
around."
</p>
<p>
A wild light came into Thresu's moonlit eyes, the hint of hope, of life
continued.
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean, friend Melkart?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm too big to fit through that window, but you're the right size. Do you
think you'd have much trouble scaling the wall?"
</p>
<p>
"No problem at all. I've done it before. The guards are dead lazy. They
never keep their rounds. But what about the bar?"
</p>
<p>
"It looks about as old as these bolts."
</p>
<p>
Melkart reached up and pulled on the bar, rocked it back and forth. Old
lime and weather-frayed brick cracked, split, and at last gave way. With
one convulsive heave, the bar broke loose.
</p>
<p>
"You're a wonder."
</p>
<p>
"Concentrate on what's important, Thresu. When you're over the wall, tell
your tribe and the others in Volturmna. Their day of liberation from the
usurper and tyrant Eryx is at hand. You'll all attend the morrow's
sacrifice, summoned by the Rex?"
</p>
<p>
Thresu nodded. "Every paganus for two leagues around must come."
</p>
<p>
"And the men have sickles and knives they can conceal in their robes."
</p>
<p>
Thresu frowned. "Aye, like all farmers, but they're cowards. They grumble
about Eryx and his crimes and harsh taxes, but no one dares raise a finger
against him. I can't say I blame them. His guards have cuirasses and
helmets, spears and swords. All we have are farm tools."
</p>
<p>
"That's enough if you add courage, Thresu. You and your tribesmen outnumber
the guard greatly. You yourself said they're lazy and undisciplined. Tell
the men Melkart stands with them. I myself will deal with Eryx and his
sons. The guards should put up little fight after that."
</p>
<p>
"So you'll just stay here. They'll be angry when they find out I've
escaped."
</p>
<p>
Melkart shrugged massive shoulders. "What are they going to do? Put me to
death? Get going, Thresu."
</p>
<p>
Thresu smiled. "Better than staying here. I give you my vow, I'll spread
the word."
</p>
<p>
"Good man. Here, I'll give you a boost."
</p>
<p>
Melkart bent low and cupped his hands. Thresu stepped into the stirrup and
with one bound wriggled his thin frame through the narrow window and was
outside. Melkart bent low and searched with his hands on the filthy
cobblestones until he found the rusty bolts and the plate. He carefully
replaced the plate and bolts in the wall, heaped straw against the plate,
and settled himself against the wall. Melkart closed his eyes, thought of
green fields and clear, blue streams, and was soon asleep.

<p class=drop>
Long before the dawn's advent, pagani in their best white togas trekked
toward Tarquinia on paved roads or narrow paths known only to their vicus,
families with them. Rich pagani traveled in two wheeled carts pulled by
sullen donkeys; poor families went on foot. The Lion Gate stood open. The
press of pagani was so great, the guards simply waved them through rather
than search everyone. Thresu bent low, concealed himself in a group of much
bigger men, and sneaked in. Pagani solemnly washed their arms and heads at
the marble fountain that burbled outside the temple's sacred boundary. Holy
ablutions performed, they draped togas over their heads and took their
places on the half moon of tiered granite seats before the terrace.
</p>
<p>
White smoke from burning myrrh and frankincense drifted up from the marble
altar set in the sunken terrace, six cubits deep. Eryx and his sons sat
upon bronze and ivory curule chairs on the terrace's opposite side, at the
foot of the temple stairs, the closest Eryx dared to approach the sacred
precinct. They still wore their celestial robes and radiate crowns. They
were attended by lictors and two white bearded haruspices, wizened faces
solemn under broad brimmed, high crowned straw hats. Each haruspex held a
strangely curved augural staff. Guards and courtiers formed an entourage,
including Churinas and Iole, in the back with the other slaves. Eryx waved
to the captain of the guard.
</p>
<p>
"Fetch the condemned man, Teitu."
</p>
<p>
Teitu bowed low, rose, about faced, and left.
</p>
<p>
Melkart heard Teitu shout as he came down the tunnel. "All right, you
foreign bastard, time to meet Kharun."
</p>
<p>
Teitu smacked his spear against the bars.
</p>
<p>
"Put up a fight, Molekart, and we'll spear you dead here and now. So come
along quietly.”
</p>
<p>
Melkart only regarded Teitu. The captain grinned broadly.
</p>
<p>
"Not so brave now you're a captive, eh? It doesn't take much to trim an
overgrown ape like you down to size. Unlock the door."
</p>
<p>
The guards nervously filed into the cell.
</p>
<p>
"Hey, where's the other one, the little paganus?"
</p>
<p>
"Look, the bar's missing from the window."
</p>
<p>
"He must have escaped last night."
</p>
<p>
"What do you know about this?" Teitu said.
</p>
<p>
"Why, nothing. I passed the time sleeping. Are you sure there was another
man? I don't remember one."
</p>
<p>
Teitu scowled. He raised his spear to strike Melkart with the butt, but
Melkart held up a warning finger.
</p>
<p>
"Remember, your master wants me in one piece."
</p>
<p>
Teitu lowered his spear. "We can find Thresu later and kill him. Here, Lar.
Take the key and release him. The rest of you, stand ready to spear him if
he acts up."
</p>
<p>
Iron key in hand, Lar bent low and undid Melkart's collar with trembling
fingers. Melkart massaged his chafed neck.
</p>
<p>
"There's eight of us here and a dozen more waiting outside, in armor with
swords and spears. No matter how strong you are, you can't outfight us all.
So show some common sense like you've done up till now and march like a
good fellow to the temple."
</p>
<p>
"Can I have breakfast first? I'm hungry."
</p>
<p>
Teitu roared with laughter. "Breakfast? How about a krater of Falernian
too? Condemned men don't get fed. You're going to be breakfast. The
monster's."
</p>
<p>
The guards all laughed. Melkart shrugged and got to his feet. They
instinctively flinched from his overpowering presence. Teitu shouted to
reassert his authority.
</p>
<p>
"Form a cordon around the condemned man. Forward march."
</p>
<p>
They walked up the tunnel that led outside. Melkart blinked, momentarily
stunned by day's unaccustomed harsh light. Teitu prodded him with his spear
butt.
</p>
<p>
"Keep moving, Molekart. Don't want to keep the Rex waiting, do we?"
</p>
<p>
The streets were deserted as before, only now because everyone was waiting
at the temple. The guards' hobnailed boots slapped hard on the flagstones
as they marched.
</p>
<p>
"What became of Kaleb?"
</p>
<p>
"You ask a lot of questions for a man who isn't long for this world. We
tried to spear the dog to death, but he was too quick. He jumped the 
fence and ran off into the night."
</p>
<p>
"He's too smart for barbarians."
</p>
<p>
Teitu shoved Melkart onward. They came to the temple. Melkart walked up to
the sunken terrace's edge. He jumped down before Teitu could push him and
landed with easy grace in the soft sand. Eryx rose and held up his arms in
evocation.
</p>
<p>
"Behold the condemned foreigner who dared to question the ways of our
paters. For that he shall suffer Tin's justice."
</p>
<p>
Melkart's voice rang out, loud and clear as a war trumpet's cry. "A wonder
such words don't burn your mouth, sinner. I learned the truth about you.
You murdered the true Rex Evandrus, your own brother, while he made
sacrifice, and then enslaved his daughter, your own blood kin. Blasphemer.
Fratricide."
</p>
<p>
A loud murmur went up from the assembled pagani. Ugly rumors had long
circulated, but no one had publicly dared give voice to them until now.
Many nodded at Melkart's incendiary accusations and shot Eryx filthy,
hateful looks. Aware he was about to lose control of the situation, Eryx
cried out.
</p>
<p>
"Loose the monster. Let Tin take his justice out on this cursed liar
through him."
</p>
<p>
Teitu waved to a squad of guards. They turned a winch that raised a
portcullis set into the wall. Cacus ran out, hungry and in a rage after
being confined. The ravenous beast shook his great mane and looked all
about him. His eyes fixed on Melkart, first and worst of his tormentors.
Melkart smiled and waved. Cacus's hideous face contorted into an even more
repulsive mass of wrinkles and bulges as his eyes went red with fury.
</p>
<p>
An enormous bolt of flame shot forth from his mouth, larger than before,
the heat so intense it singed nearby spectators' hair. Just as Cacus let
loose with his fire blast, Melkart ducked behind the altar, which blocked
the bulk of the flames. The white marble was left permanently blackened.
Exhausted by the effort, Cacus's barrel chest heaved as he tried to regain
breath for another blast.
</p>
<p>
Melkart darted from behind the altar. Fast as fleet footed Akhilleous, he
dashed across the terrace and threw himself upon Cacus. They hit the yellow
sand with a deafening crash. Everyone watched enthralled, from the lowest
paganus to Eryx the Rex, eyes fixed unblinking as the two titans fought to
the death. Cacus sought to wrap tree trunk arms around Melkart in a fatal
embrace, but he grabbed the brute by the wrists in his own iron hard grasp.
</p>
<p>
Each struggled to overcome the other in a prolonged test of strength. Cacus
snapped ferociously with sharp fangs at Melkart's face. He deftly bobbed
and weaved his head, kept it away from the monster's maw. Little by little
though, human arms slowly gave way to inhuman, chthonic strength. Cacus
smiled in delight as he pulled Melkart closer, yellow eyes aflame with
piggy joy.
</p>
<p>
Loud barks and a nasty growl. A black form sailed through the air, launched
from the battlements above. Kaleb agilely landed on all fours and bounded
to his master's aid. He sank his teeth deep into the hamstrings of Cacus's
left leg. The monster screamed with pain. Distracted, he let Melkart go,
turned, and kicked Kaleb the length of the terrace.
</p>
<p>
"There's that damned black dog. He was hiding here the whole time,"
Antagones cried.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, and now I'll fix him too," Phobis said.
</p>
<p>
A long javelin sailed through the air. Thrown hard and well aimed, the
javelin pierced Kaleb straight through his vitals. The dog expired without
a whimper, dead game to the bitter end.
</p>
<p>
"Now you'll pay," Melkart roared.
</p>
<p>
He threw a handful of sand and small rocks into Cacus's eyes. The monster
screamed with pain and tried to rub the grit from his eyes with his hands.
Melkart hurtled toward him. His feet drove into Cacus's unprotected
stomach, a double blow that left the monster dazed, sprawled, and prone.
Before Cacus could regain his breath, Melkart leapt onto the small of his
back with all his weight and force. He bent low and cupped his hands around
Cacus's jaw. Melkart pulled on Cacus's head with every last obol of
strength.
</p>
<p>
Cacus thrashed and emitted guttural moans. He bucked like a wild horse in a
desperate effort to free himself, but Melkart kept his footing and
continued to apply pressure. Veins protruded from Melkart's neck and arms
as his face turned red from the strain. Cacus's eyes swelled from their
sockets. A blood engorged, bloated, purple tongue jutted from his open
mouth. He struggled with his last remnant of vitality to survive,
desperately fierce, fighting to the last.
</p>
<p>
There was a loud, awful crack like a mighty oak's crash under a woodsman's
axe. Cacus thrashed once more, fouled himself, and lay still, dead at last.
Melkart got to his feet, but stood hunched over, gasping for breath.
</p>
<p>
Thresu shouted from amid the crowd. "My friend Melkart. Hail him. Ave.
Greet him as our Pater."
</p>
<p>
Cheers went up throughout the crowd. "Hail him," they cried. "Ave, Pater
Patriae, Father of Our Country."
</p>
<p>
The last greeting was traditionally reserved for the Rex. Eryx stamped his
foot, angrily shook a fist at the pagani, and turned to Teitu.
</p>
<p>
"Spear him down."
</p>
<p>
Teitu signaled for guards to throw their spears, but Melkart was already on
the move. He ran to Kaleb's carcass, snatched up the javelin, turned, and
threw it.
</p>
<p>
The javelin plunged into Antagones's stomach, all the way through.
Antagones looked down at the shaft buried in his guts. He turned to Eryx
and gave a piteous, small child's wail.
</p>
<p>
"Pater, see what the paganus did to me."
</p>
<p>
Antagones fell. He writhed in agony as his copious blood stained white
marble flagstones irreversibly red. Terrified, the haruspices hiked up
their tunics and ran for their lives. The lictors followed in a cowardly
funk.
</p>
<p>
"Here's our chance, men," Thresu said. "Rise up. Kill the blasphemers."
</p>
<p>
Thresu threw off his toga and pulled out a short, sharp knife. He jammed it
into a nearby guard's throat. Encouraged by his example, other pagani took
out knives and sickles and set upon the guards. Outnumbered and opposed by
armed, desperate, righteously indignant men, the mercenary guards were soon
overpowered and murdered. Courtiers panicked and fled, Churinas foremost
among them. Paralyzed by the sight of his dying son, Eryx was left with
Phobis and Teitu at the foot of the temple stairs.
</p>
<p>
"Lord Eryx, we must flee. I can't defend you alone."
</p>
<p>
"Pater. Stop staring at Antagones. You can't help him. You have to do
something. Let's run for it."
</p>
<p>
With one bound, Melkart leaped from the terrace and stood among them. Teitu
raised his sword and charged, but Melkart slammed a ham sized right fist to
his jaw in a devastating punch. Teitu's head snapped right. Shattered
teeth flew from his mouth in every direction. He fell unconscious.
</p>
<p>
Mind suddenly focused by imminent peril, Eryx held up his hands in a
placatory gesture.
</p>
<p>
"Melkart, wait. I admit I broke the rules of hospitality, but that's
nothing I can't make up. I'll give you a thousand cattle, why not two
thousand? I'll gather up every cow in the valley, never mind whose they
are-"
</p>
<p>
Frowning, Melkart grabbed Eryx by the scruff of the neck with one hand and
his back with the other. He hoisted the tyrant high overhead. Eryx's
toga and crown fell off. He dangled awkwardly in the air, fat, middle aged,
well past his prime.
</p>
<p>
"Melkart. No. I said we can negotiate-"
</p>
<p>
"Blasphemer. Fratricide. Suffer your just fate."
</p>
<p>
Melkart hurled Eryx upward. Eryx sped screaming toward the temple.
</p>
<p>
"NNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO."
</p>
<p>
Tin's grim statue loomed gray among dark shadows, full of menace, a certain
portent of Eryx's foreordained doom. Eryx landed inside the temple with a
hard thump.
</p>
<p>
"AAAAAIIIIIIIEEEEEEEE."
</p>
<p>
Eryx writhed on cold marble stones as if he lay on hot coals. Before
onlookers' appalled and awed eyes, he suffered all the tortures of the
damned in Tartarus. Invisible razors surgically flayed living skin from his
body as each hair was individually torn from his head, right down to the
eyebrows and beard. Nerve endings were stabbed with needles as capillaries
slowly wound around one another until they strangled themselves. Face
reduced almost to a skull, Eryx looked up with withering eyes at the idol
and begged for release from his misery.
</p>
<p>
Tin's statue gazed down upon this calvary and faintly smiled. From the
hypaethral opening in the temple's roof, there was a clink of terracotta
kraters, a lyre's ring, and booming laughter from celestial banquet
couches. Lightning flashed from the northwest out of a cloudless sky.
</p>
<p>
"Looks like Tin thinks you did right by the bastard," Thresu said.
</p>
<p>
Worked up by battle frenzy, eyes locked in a long distance stare on Eryx's
remains, Melkart suddenly noticed Thresu who'd been by his side for some
time.
</p>
<p>
"Friend Thresu. You're indeed a man of your word and rare courage too. What
happened to that bastard Photis?"
</p>
<p>
"It's Phobis. Rascne and Plesna have him. You didn't think we'd just let
him run away, do you?"
</p>
<p>
"Bring him here."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, friend Melkart."
</p>
<p>
Two husky pagani dragged Phobis over. He fought every step of the way.
</p>
<p>
"Unhand me, you dirty villains. I'm the rightful Rex now, your lord and
master."
</p>
<p>
"No," Melkart said. "You're a dog killer. Come here, you."
</p>
<p>
Melkart grabbed Phobis by the throat. He knelt down and balanced Phobis on
his right knee.
</p>
<p>
"Stop. What are you doing?" Phobis shrieked.
</p>
<p>
Melkart put his big hands on Phobis and brought them down. The princeling's
spine snapped in two. Melkart disdainfully threw Phobis to the marble where
he writhed in agony by his dead brother.
</p>
<p>
"Eheu, paganus," he moaned. "You've crippled me."
</p>
<p>
"Writhe like the worm you are. Grovel in the dust. Beg for bread and wine
for the rest of your life from those you once abused. Marduk's curse on
you. Get him from my sight."
</p>
<p>
Pagani carried Phobis away.
</p>
<p>
"Where is Iole, Thresu?"
</p>
<p>
"She fled with the rest of the court to the palace."
</p>
<p>
"Let's go there. Bring Eryx's crown and toga along."
</p>
<p>
Thresu hurried to keep pace with Melkart. Courtiers and servants were
gathered in the palace's small courtyard. Churinas and other high ranking
officials prostrated themselves when Melkart entered.
</p>
<p>
"Ave, Lord Melkart. We are your slaves," Churinas said.
</p>
<p>
"No, you're not. Get up and hand over your staff."
</p>
<p>
Trembling, reluctant, Churinas nonetheless handed Melkart his ivory staff.
Melkart scanned the crowd. Taller than everyone else, he quickly spotted
Iole. He held out his right hand in invitation.
</p>
<p>
"Please come forward, Iole."
</p>
<p>
The young woman stepped through the crowd. Adept at adjusting to new
circumstances, courtiers who'd once treated her contemptuously looked on
with newfound respect. She stood before Melkart, a smile on her face.
</p>
<p>
"I thought for sure you'd die today. Instead, you killed Cacus and Eryx
too. You've avenged my Pater, Evandrus. I owe you everything. I'm your
slave now, Melkart."
</p>
<p>
"I told you no, Iole. You're the Lady of Volturmna now."
</p>
<p>
Melkart draped the blue toga over Iole's slender shoulders. He held the
gold radiate crown over her head.
</p>
<p>
"Honor your liege lady, the rightful heiress to Volturmna, Iole, daughter
of Evandrus, restored to her lawful high station and rank."
</p>
<p>
Everyone prostrated themselves before Iole. Overcome by the sudden, wild
turn of events, Iole fought her emotions, but quickly mastered herself and
stood proud and tall like the aristocrat she was raised to be. The
courtiers rose and hailed her.
</p>
<p>
"Ave, Regina. Vivat Iole."
</p>
<p>
Melkart handed the ivory staff to Thresu.
</p>
<p>
"You're brave and honest, Thresu, and a loyal companion even when things
get difficult. You'll be a good chief steward. If you approve, my lady?"
</p>
<p>
Iole nodded. "Your recommendation is enough, Melkart. I know Thresu will
serve me well."
</p>
<p>
Thresu gasped. "From paganus to chief steward? Truly, Tin favors the bold.
Wait until I get a hold of Aule. I'll serve you faithfully to my dying day,
Lady Iole."
</p>
<p>
"Heed my commands then. Tell the haruspices to purify and re-sanctify the
temple and to burn Eryx's remains outside the city walls. Let Antagones be
buried in the potter's field outside the city walls with no stone or marker
so no one ever knows where he lies. Phobis may beg outside the city walls,
but may never again enter Tarquinia."
</p>
<p>
"Hail our royal mistress. Hear her justice, mercy, and wisdom," the
courtiers cried.
</p>
<p>
"Clear the regal bedchamber of Eryx's things. The sons' chambers too. Burn
everything that belonged to them."
</p>
<p>
"And what of Churinas?" Melkart asked. "He betrayed and tormented you.
Shall I snap his neck for you, my lady?"
</p>
<p>
The fat courtier trembled so hard his scarlet synthesina shimmied. Iole
dismissed him with a glance.
</p>
<p>
"Don't trouble yourself. Churinas may live on as a swineherd, with pigs for
companions, far from Tarquinia's walls."
</p>
<p>
"You hear that, you fat bastard?" Thresu said. "Thank our lady for her
mercy, Churinas."
</p>
<p>
In tears at the thought of a life of luxurious gluttony abruptly brought to
a rude pastoral end, Churinas still had enough sense and remaining courtier
instinct to prostrate himself again.
</p>
<p>
"Your slave thanks you, Mistress, for sparing his life. I'll try my best to
be a good swineherd."
</p>
<p>
Melkart snorted with laughter. "Get out of here, Churinas."
</p>
<p>
Churinas gratefully ran from the courtyard to a hard life outdoors tending
pigs. Melkart put his right hand to his heart and bowed low to Iole.
</p>
<p>
"My lady, I must tend to Kaleb. You'll excuse me."
</p>
<p>
"I understand, Melkart, but let me help perform the honors."
</p>
<p>
Melkart smiled. "You're kind, Iole."
</p>
<p>
They went to the terrace where Kaleb lay. Two slaves gently picked up his
body and set it on a litter. Melkart led the procession with Iole by his
side. Slaves carried the litter behind them. Urbani and pagani followed,
mantles and togas draped over their heads, as if in mourning for their own
kin. The sad lament went up, the paean to the warrior who died fighting for
Volturmna. Outside the city, Melkart built a pyre from dead wood with
Thresu's help. He laid Kaleb atop the pyre and stroked his thick, black
hair for the last time. Haruspices anointed the dog with oil, myrrh, and
frankincense, and a laurel wreath was laid upon the body, hero's honors.
</p>
<p>
After he ignited the pyre with a torch, Melkart sang a threnody in his
foreign, unknown tongue while loyal Kaleb's fur caught fire. His body was
swiftly consumed by the raging fire. Melkart wept as he would for any human
companion. Kaleb was the last of the rarest breed, blood brother of
Kerberus and Orthros, semi-divine canines.
</p>
<p>
When Kaleb was completely consumed, Melkart went outside the walls and
checked the cattle herd. To his relief, only the guide bull had been
slaughtered. The remaining herd was well fed and in good health after a
long rest.
</p>
<p>
A banquet was held that night at the Hall of Couches, but the fare was
simple, coarse bread, well watered wine, and smoked eels. A poet strummed
the lyre and sang tales of brave Ulixes. As usual, Melkart ate heartily.
Iole poured fresh spring water into his krater and smiled at him.
</p>
<p>
"Melkart, won't you stay and help me rule Volturmna? Frankly, I can use
your strong right arm. You always seem to know what to do."
</p>
<p>
"You praise me too highly, Iole. I want to help you, always and forever,
but I remain under a bond to deliver the cattle. Once that task is done,
I'll return. You have my word."
</p>
<p>
Iole nodded, saddened by Melkart's words, but then suddenly brightened.
</p>
<p>
"Take Lupu. He's my gift to you. The leagues will fly swiftly under his
hooves."
</p>
<p>
Melkart raised his krater in a toast.
</p>
<p>
"You do me honor, Lady Iole."
</p>
<p>
"Please. Call me Iole." Melkart laughed merrily.
</p>
<p class=drop>Melkart set out at sunrise on Lupu. Before he mounted the horse, Iole
handed him his lionskin, well brushed with a freshly shampooed mane. As he
rode through the Lion Gate, Phobis writhed in the dust nearby. He held out
his clay bowl, indifferent to who passed, intent only upon begging enough
to get drunk. Thresu disdainfully threw a copper coin into the bowl.
</p>
<p>
Melkart drove the herd before him, a new, young guide bull in the lead. The
court accompanied him to the valley's edge on foot. Iole rode in a litter
as became her high station. The bright sun slowly ascended into an eggshell
blue sky. Farmers and hinds cheered as Melkart and the herd passed, forever
grateful to the man who rid them of Tin's curse and the tyrant Eryx.
</p>
<p>
They reached the valley's edge. Melkart drove the herd up the path and
through the pass. Iole and her court watched them ascend. When the last cow
trotted up the pass, Melkart turned Lupu around. Iole, Thresu, and the
others waved and shouted blessings.
</p>
<p>
"Farewell, but return soon. Tin, Uni, and Cel keep you."
</p>
<p>
Melkart raised his right arm and waved farewell, teeth bared in a blazing
smile. He turned Lupu, rode off, and was gone from sight.
</p>
<p>
"When do you think he'll return, my lady?"
</p>
<p>
"In the spring, Thresu, a year from now," Iole replied. Her gaze was far
away. "He promised me."
