<div><i>A delightful little vignette which actually contains more truth
than fiction.</i>
<p class=drop>We had to endure the usual oblique glances
from Altdorfer&#146;s aunt as we passed through the sitting-room.  Each time
I visited the house, she had been sitting in the same armchair, knitting
the same quilt.  Altdorfer says it was originally intended as a scarf,
but the old gentleman for whom it was generously being created had
inconveniently died at quite an early stage of its colourful growth.
Thereafter the scarf increased in dimensions and complexity,
prospectively becoming first a rug and then a quilt.  By now it could
easily be used to camouflage a tank, and is well on its way to providing
cover for, say, a football field.  Given time and a sufficient supply of
wool, it may ultimately replace Wales as a popular measure of disaster
areas.</P> <P>I followed Altdorfer through to the study.  If ever a room
deserved the name, this was no longer it.  I knew it to harbour a desk
and chairs, but these could now be seen only in tantalising glimpses,
like the ankles of a demure Victorian maiden. They were concealed by a
seemingly random overspill from the well-stocked bookshelves which
obscured the walls.  Somewhere there was even a computer.  Among the few
items of furniture which remained relatively uncluttered was the old
floral-patterned sofa, threadbare but still reasonably comfortable, and
it was to this familiar relic that we gravitated.</P> <P><P>The box-files stacked on an adjoining coffee-table allowed just
enough room for a bottle of Altdorfer&#146;s favoured Kirsch and two
surprisingly clean squat glasses.  He filled these, and handed one to
me.  &quot;Up theirs!&quot; we chorused ritually, before resuming the
serious business of studying the startling batch of documents I had been
left by Ryan Trench.</P> <P><P class=drop>We had known Trench when he was a young classics student
with an interest in Sanskrit and Monopoly.  The Monopoly should have
given us a clue to his secret acquisitiveness.  He was a gawky, awkward
youth, socially inept, but evidently a good scholar, with a conviction
that one day he would make his mark on the world.  To that end he
cultivated an accent one might associate with an effete aristocracy, yet
exhibited a kind of fawning gratitude towards those who were indulgent
towards him despite his gauche behaviour.</P> <P><P>I was working at the time for a long-established antiquarian
bookseller; an old family firm, learning the intricacies of cataloguing,
and it was there that Ryan Trench found a vacation job in the downstairs
packing department.  Below this were &#145;The Vaults&#146; &#150; the sub-basement
storage area containing thousands of dusty volumes waiting to be sorted
and priced.  This led out through the tradesman&#146;s entrance, where Ryan
parked his bike, to the cobbled streets of old Edinburgh.</P> <P><P>I had a flat nearby, and at some point Ryan began dropping in at
week-ends, quite possibly uninvited, and irrespective of whether I might
already have company.  On one such visit he arrived just as a casual
game of Monopoly was about to begin, and it would have been churlish not
to invite him to join in.  I forget now which assembly of my friends was
present.  Altdorfer, certainly, probably Marcus and Stella, maybe
Anitra, or Piers.  In contrast to our laid-back, convivial approach to
the game, Ryan&#146;s was compulsive, intense.  To him it was not a game to
be enjoyed, but an opportunity to exercise control.  And when he failed
to accumulate sufficient property or wealth, the fault had to lie in the
inadequacy of the rules, or the design of the board.  After several
sessions Ryan excused himself, and spent the next few weeks
constructing, in his spare time, a larger board with additional squares
and their related property cards, and extra model buildings to represent
a level of possession beyond hotels; historic houses, perhaps, or
palaces.  Much to his chagrin, by the time he brought this superior
version to our attention, we had thankfully outgrown Monopoly in any
form.</P> <P><P>Not long after his graduation, Trench&#146;s mother, his remaining parent,
had died, bequeathing him their house in a leafy Edinburgh suburb.  On
one occasion he unexpectedly invited me round to sample his vintage
Tokay.  I had not been there long before he revealed his ulterior
motive.  &quot;Come and see the attic,&quot; he said.  There I was
amazed to see, neatly cleaned and shelved, a large number of mostly
vellum-bound Latin texts &#150; antiquarian treasures &#150; which he had secretly
been liberating from their centuries of captivity in &#145;The Vaults&#146;.  He
seemed inordinately proud of this &#145;cultural rescue&#146;, as he called it,
and quite oblivious to the possibility that he might be charged with a
criminal offence.  As it happened, he was soon to lose his job when the
owner of the premises interrupted a further &#145;rescue&#146; mission, by
enquiring exactly what it was that Ryan was strapping to the back of his
bike.</P> <P><P>Fortunately for Trench, the disappearance of earlier volumes had not
been noticed, and since he had not previously drawn attention to his
rescue service, he thereby avoided prosecution.  What became of all
those confiscated books we never discovered, but from the sporadic cards
I received over the next few years we do know that Trench eventually
sold the house, moved to London, and became a professional
archaeologist.  None of us saw him again.</P> <P><P>Almost a quarter of a century later I was contacted by a very
respectable Scottish lady, a former fellow-student of Ryan&#146;s, who
informed me of his recent death, and explained that she was now his
executrix.  Despite those long years of silence, the news of his death
genuinely saddened me, and I was surprised and curiously flattered to
learn that he had valued our brief crossing of paths enough to leave me
a few illustrated books and a collection of papers.  The books were
early twentieth century, and attractively decorated by an artist he knew
I liked.  The papers were quite another matter, and as soon as I saw
their contents I realised that I needed to consult Altdorfer.</P> <P><P class=drop>You probably know of the so-called &#145;Antikythera device&#146;;
the fused clump of corroded bronze recovered by a diver from the sea bed
near Crete in 1900.  Seven or eight decades later, after much expert
examination, and the application of x-ray tomography, it was deduced to
be a precision-made astronomical calendar with over thirty differential
gears, designed to demonstrate lunar and planetary cycles with a high
degree of accuracy.  Working models have since been reconstructed as
proof of this complex example of technology from more than two millenia
ago.  This mechanism is generally regarded as the oldest such device
known, but there is no reason to believe it was unique.  In historical
perspective it was predated by air-guns, alarm clocks, convex lenses,
chain-drives, lathes, the magnetic compass, and of course the
steam-powered toy pigeon with which Archytas of Tarentum amused himself
and possibly the younger members of his family.</P> <P><P>But even that takes us only to about 420 BC. Two or three thousand
years further back we are still in familiar territory: beer and
dentists, glassmaking and weighing machines, maps, contraceptives and
gold mines, not necessarily in order of priority.  Another ten or twenty
thousand years into the past we have figurines, weaponry, evidence of
needlework, painting, musical instruments.  Stone lamps have been found
from sixty thousand years before that, while the earliest known
decorative amulets date from more than 100,000 years ago &#150; a small
fraction &#150; a mere 5% - of the traceable existence of tool-making
hominids on this planet.</P> <P><P>Civilisations rise and fall, succumb at length to inescapable natural
processes &#150; erosion, earthquake, eruption, landslide, tsunami, flood,
fire, drought, and consequential biological scourges such as starvation
and disease.  Perhaps one should include climate-change and asteroid
impact as lurking triggers.  The odd gamma-ray burst from a distant
pulsar cannot be discounted.    It&#146;s also salutory to remember that the
Easter Islanders ran out of trees, and that in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century we have an enormously improved capacity for
self-extermination.</P> <P><P>As Altdorfer says, somewhat pompously, we exist at the interface
between history and geology.  Inevitably, things get buried,
intentionally or otherwise, become trapped in gradual or sudden tectonic
shifts, carried by water, overlaid, subducted.  In the course of
humanity&#146;s short career entire cultures repeatedly blossom and vanish.
Archaeologists and palaeontologists, assiduously recording their
fragmentary finds, can merely scratch the surface, and the contents of
museums will always be exceeded by what remains undiscovered and for the
most part irretrievable. </P> <P><P>The papers of Ryan Trench hint at a lost body of knowledge from a
time when our protohistorical record is virtually blank. Frustratingly,
we have not yet been able to establish the current whereabouts of the
artifacts he refers to in his sketches and photographs, but his notes
indicate that they were found some metres below the sea-bed off the
coast of Gujarat, not far from the Mul Dwarka excavations.  One of the
photographs shows a partially cleaned, flat circular metal plate above a
plastic scale indicating it to be about 20 centimetres in diameter.  He
does not identify the metal, but the cleaned area (the lower half) seems
to have a brassy sheen, and is inscribed with rows of regular
markings.</P> <P><P>Another image shows the obverse of the same plate, where incised
lines form what I thought at first looked like a na&iuml;ve drawing of a
small train meeting a large hedgehog.  Each carriage has horizontal
bars, and the hedgehog is curled into a protective ball.  Altdorfer
suggested a rather interesting interpretation.</P> <P><P>A third photograph shows an irregular encrustation of marine
organisms on what seems to be a cluster of eggs.  On the back, in Ryan&#146;s
neat hand, he had written &quot;Vitreous!&quot;.  A detailed sketch of
one of the &#145;eggs&#146; notes the thickness of the shell to be 2.3mm.  There
are also enlarged sketches of both sides of the metal plate, with a few
attempts at translation of some of the incised characters, mostly
crossed out.  Two words, however, have been emphatically encircled:
&#145;day&#146; and &#145;enable&#146;.  Even if only approximately correct, we suspect
these may help to explain the train and the hedgehog, and quite possibly
the eggs.</P> <P><P>Among those unremembered creators of metal and glass another
forgotten genius had discovered a way to utilise electricity. Altdorfer
believes the train represents battery cells of some kind, and that the
hedgehog is a symbol either of the sun, or of a manufactured source of
heat and light.</P> <P><P class=drop>Of Ryan Trench&#146;s papers we have properly examined only the
first few in the topmost of the eleven box files.  In due course this
private archive will appear online, but for now we are still relishing
the luxury of our sneak preview.  So far, we have not encountered any
improved versions of board games, but who knows what else we will find
before Altdorfer&#146;s aunt finishes her quilt?</P> <P><p> <P>
