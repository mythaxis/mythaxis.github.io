<div><i><b>"Every parting is a form of death, as every reunion is a
type
of	   
heaven".</b> <br><small>Tryon Edwards</small></i>
<P>
<div class=plate>149</div> <P><p class="drop">What is that bizarre contraption thrumming purposefully
northwards along Narpins Way, trailing wafts of hot copper, ripe peaches
and aging fish? </p>		 <P><p>It could only be Ruckney Plitter in his custom-built pre-SunCell
landshrinker, heading back to Snoak for the annual reunion with Ma
Wheggs. By pre-arrangement, on the first mutually convenient day in
Spring a half dozen of her former lodgers, all contemporaries, returned
for this celebratory event. It is unlikely that their respective paths
would ever have crossed if they had not chosen to come to Snoak City
from their scattered parental homes during those few formative years,
drawing strength from the happy accident of each other&#146;s company as they
faced unknown vicissitudes at the start of their future careers. Most of
them had opted to stay in Snoak, and now had their own apartments.
Ruckney was one of the two exceptions.</p> <P><p>The much cherished vehicle (referred to as &#145;Ruckney&#146;s rattletrap&#145;
only by the ignorant or envious), slowed to a raucous crawl as it
approached Slebb&#146;s Junction, where he always found the signs confusing.
He passed the grounds of the old ParaPet works (now a fruit-juice
processing plant), ignoring the roadsign at Brandurp Street which
pointed west to Smatparrox, and noting the presence of another new
construction site. &#145;<i>NEUTRILAX LETS</i> <b>YOU</b> <i>CHOOSE</i>!&#146;
declared a portentously cryptic hoarding. To his left he recognized the
allotments bordering 20bird Lane, and beyond them the brightly-coloured
playground of the pre-school nursery, which meant that the turning after
next would be Welfage Road, leading to Park Street West and the familiar
blue-painted door of No.149 where Ma Wheggs used to brood over her
fledgling clutch of guests with something very close to maternal
concern.</p> <P><p>On encountering the new severe parking restrictions in the inner
city, Ruckney found himself having to circle anticlockwise round the
entire perimeter of Garrible Park before finding an unoccupied place in
the designated area behind Praspafole Stadium. Watching the other
vehicles darting and gliding in and out of their neat spaces like
tropical fish, he supposed that in comparison his trusty shrinker was
more like a giant turtle: marginally noisier when in motion, he
conceded, but so much easier to find in a crowd than one of those
ubiquitous shiny toys, despite any vaunted advantages in terms of
economy. Extracting his pungent bags, he locked the shrinker and set off
on his unplanned walk to the sanctuary of No.149.</p>
					 
<p>As he turned the corner into Park Street West a rush of memories
jostled for precedence: his first arrival as a nervous young apprentice,
the time he and his new friend Sawly, flouting the house rules, had
smuggled back a bottle of wine wrapped in a towel, only for it to slip
and smash on the doorstep, or the occasion when one of the women from
next door (whom he had scarcely glimpsed until then) had once roused the
household well after midnight, seeking help to extricate a smouldering
mattress. The appearance of a pretty young woman in her nightclothes (to
Ruckney it was a beatific vision) was a definite stimulus to what he
smugly recalled was his unhesitatingly heroic assistance. Much later he
discovered (though not from Ma Wheggs) the actual nature of the house
next door, and the importance of functional and preferably
fire-resistant mattresses to the continued satisfaction of its
client&#232;le. </p>		 
					 
<p>The panel beside the doorbell was still reassuringly headed
<dim class=plate>WHEGGS</dim>. Below
this was a list of unfamiliar
names where his own and those of his contemporaries used to be, making
him feel momentarily as if he were trespassing, but the ripe odours
escaping from his bags reminded him he should probably ring the bell.
</p>				 
					 
<p>The door opened, and there she was: short, plump, benign, swathed in
the brightly festive printed silks she always wore for the annual
gathering, the straggling bun of hair perhaps a little greyer since his
last visit. As he gently disengaged from Ma Wheggs&#146; affectionate hug and
shrugged off his coat, the sound of lively voices confirmed that the
others had already arrived, all being relatively local, apart from
Sawly, who would have cruised downriver from his studio in Trevury in
his Slipshell Skimmer. Over Ma Wheggs&#146; head Ruckney saw that they had
assembled as usual in the big kitchen at the end of the corridor, past
the carpeted staircase leading up to the lodgers&#146; rooms. </p>
					 
<p>There were cries of &#147;Here he is!&#148;, &#147;Hey, Ruckney!&#148; and &#147;It&#146;s the
Shrinkerman!&#148; as he approached the kitchen. Someone took his coat and
relieved him of his bags before he had a chance to open them, freeing
him for enthusiastic handshakes and claps on the back from Sawly Vext
and Strag Wilderfoot, and welcoming kisses on cheeks from Tebbi Nemming,
Yethne Farfyle and a third girl he did not at first recognize, until he
realized that the fiery sunset of hair must belong to the once shy young
woman he knew as Cendrel Pirch. </p>
					 
<div class=plate>PIRCH</div>
					 
<p class="drop">Platport was a quiet coastal community. Cendrel&#146;s
parents were florists, supplying much of their stock from their own
garden and greenhouses. Their first child had died very suddenly from a
rare bacterial infection, barely a year old, and the loss continued to
haunt their lives, even after Cendrel&#146;s advent. As she grew up there
were times when Cendrel felt almost stiflingly over-protected, and
others when some unexpected reminder of her parents&#146; lingering grief
would briefly cast a sullen cloud over otherwise normal activities. </p>
					 
<p>Cendrel was diffident about venturing into the shop, because it still
evoked an uncomfortable early memory of being terrified by a woman
shouting over the shrill yelps of her uncontrolled dog. She felt most at
ease outdoors among the plants, for which she felt a secret affinity. At
school she discovered that she had a flair for design, and later she
grew adept at the decorative side of the business; her floral
arrangements were instinctively balanced in terms of colour, scent and
composition, but she yearned for the freedom to be able to work on a
grander scale. Eventually she prevailed on her parents to let her apply
for the vocational course in landscape gardening offered by Sparagulan
College in association with the botanical gardens in Garrible Park. </p>
					 
<p>The euphoria of being accepted for the course was tempered by anxiety
about moving to Snoak City and having to cope with strangers. From the
accommodation list approved by the College, she selected the address
closest to the park, and in due course made the acquaintance of Ma
Wheggs, that least intimidating of landladies. Within a week of her
arrival the shy girl from Platport had been befriended by another
lodger, Tebbi Nemming, a sophisticated research assistant almost a year
her senior, who appointed herself Cendrel&#146;s mentor, and in place of the
elder sister Cendrel had never known, set about fortifying the younger
girl&#146;s self-confidence. </p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>&#147;Trout, I expect. It&#146;s still wrapped. And some furry
fruit. They seem
to have leaked a bit.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Watch out for the cat. She&#146;ll have that fish quicker than you can
say &#145;Plitter!&#146; &#147;</p> 
					 
<p>&#147;Did someone call me?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#145;It&#146;s all right, Ruckers, we&#146;re just unloading your gifts. How&#146;s the
old shrinker, by the way?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Perfectly fine, thanks. Had to leave it down by the Stadium, thanks
to the new pedestrian zones. By the way, anyone know what &#145;Neutrilax&#146;
is? I passed a big sign on the corner of Brandurp Street.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;I&#146;m sure I&#146;ve seen the name somewhere. Is it one of those skin-care
soaps?&#148;</p>			 
					 
<p>&#147;It sounds like something they use to quieten horses.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Tebbi will know. Hey, Tebbi, what&#146;s &#145;Neutrilax&#146;?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;No idea. It&#146;s probably either a breakfast cereal or a contraceptive.
Unless it&#146;s for treating acidity in the soil, in which case Cendrel&#146;s
your expert, am I right, Cen?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;If it were something for the soil, yes. But it&#146;s not, at least as
far as I know. I think it might be an industrial solvent.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>From the doorway came a sound of chuckling, familiar to everyone
present. They turned to the silk-swathed source.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Do you know something we don&#146;t, Ma Wheggs? asked Ruckney.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Oh, I certainly do, Mr Plitter. I know you all lead busy lives, but
if any of you boys and girls had been paying attention, you might have
heard about the competition.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>The general murmur of interest was just sufficient to mask the sound
of a cat surreptitiously trying to unwrap a trout.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s a back-to-front advertising campaign,&#148; explained Ma Wheggs. &#147;It
started a few weeks ago, in the press and the other media, and there are
posters everywhere. The competition&#146;s very simple: to describe in
exactly a hundred words the product that best matches the name
&#145;Neutrilax&#146;. The winner can choose between either a fixed cash prize or
a guaranteed 5% stake in the profits from sales of the eventual
product.&#148;</p>		 
					 
<p>Yethne was dismissive. &#147;That&#146;s a crazy idea! The product has to come
first. My class of ten-year olds could tell you that.&#148; </p>
					 
<p>&#147;Maybe it&#146;s just crazy enough to work,&#148; said Strag. &#147;Some bored
entrepreneur with access to lots of facilities must be willing to take a
big risk. Probably old Quanderpyre. You used to work in the big pink
tower, Tebs. Did you ever meet him?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Not once in the two years I was there, but I was only a humble
researcher on the fifteenth floor. I believe he spends most of his time
in the penthouse guarding his treasures.&#148; </p>
					 
<p>&#147;I&#146;ve heard people saying Farras Grein might be behind it,&#148; said Ma
Wheggs. &#147;But no-one seems to know for sure.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s certainly a novel way to make sure everyone knows the product
name, whatever it turns out to be, but for it to be successful it would
still have to be something that they actually need,&#148; said Sawly.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Ah, but Sawl, surely you&#146;re not saying that people buy only what
they need?&#148;</p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;Well no, of course not, Ruckers, I mean they&#146;d have to be persuaded
it was something indispensable, such as...&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Twitching fish!&#148; </p>
					 
<p>The sudden yell came from Tebbi, who was pointing at a spot on the
floor, where a large well-wrapped deceased trout, which only the day
before had been lurking quietly in a stream in Drether&#146;s Wheen, was seen
to be edging its way under the table with a kind of jerky deliberation
that was quite hypnotic to watch. </p>
					 
<p>With surprising agility Ma Wheggs crossed the space from door to
table, and with a practiced motion that was almost balletic, scooped up
the offending cat and separated it from its inert prey as she headed for
the back door. &#147;Husspert, you are a wilful rogue, and one day I&#146;m going
to put you out for good and replace you with a phoelix&#133; or even a
modifido,&#148; they heard her telling it with her customary reproachful
fondness.</p>		 
					 
<div class=plate>NEMMING</div>
					 
<p class=drop>The Nemming household in Meheric was not a place for
meditation, or
even for taking a quick nap in the afternoon. Tebbi&#146;s father was the
area representative for a firm making industrial lighting systems, and
when not travelling he enjoyed rigging up experimental test kits at
home. There were very few dark corners. Her mother was a part-time
teacher with a passion for making decorative pots, which she prepared in
the basement workroom (brighter than the average), and fired in the kiln
she had constructed in the back garden. </p>
					 
<p>Harlio and Twace, Tebbi&#146;s older brothers, were sports-oriented. They
owned balls of various textures, dimensions and degrees of elasticity,
together with a selection of striking implements. Their target ranges
for projectiles outgrew the confines of their pockmarked bedrooms. They
would disappear for hours on their racing twindles. They ran, swam,
wrestled, leaped, glided and generally exercised their sinewy limbs.
Tebbi, whose principal status had been as their favourite toy, tolerated
their doting and teasing until she grew old enough to become a
participant on her own terms. Although they remained faster and
stronger, her co-ordination and stamina were better than theirs, which
gratifyingly earned her their respect. </p>
					 
<p>While her brothers continued to pursue their sporting interests Tebbi
completed her formal schooling, returned for an evening course on data
management, and then tried to decide what she really wanted to do. She
had harboured ambitions to be a dancer, a deep-sea diver, a forensic
psychologist and a fashion model, but came to realize that these were
probably mutually incompatible careers. She told herself to be
practical, knowing she needed to broaden her horizons, and started
looking for job opportunities outside Meheric. Quanderpyre Investments
were seeking &#145;smart young research assistants&#146;, and offered in-work
training as well as a generous starting salary. If accepted, she would
need to find somewhere to stay among the bright lights of Snoak. The
prospect of life in the big city was both daunting and enticing. Come to
think of it, the lights might not be as bright as those at home, but she
was sure she would adapt.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>The custom on these occasions was for each of the guests
to bring dishes of food, both savoury and sweet, requiring a minimal
amount of cooking, although, if necessary, reheating or chilling were
permissible. Those with little or no culinary skills (such as Ruckney
Plitter) were excused from advance preparation. It was agreed that Ma
Wheggs should not involve herself in any further cooking process.
However, in deference to her territorial rights and experience, she
would be allowed to offer supervisory advice. </p>
					 
<p>Ma Wheggs always insisted on providing both a basket of fresh bread
and a welcome jugful of chilled emberskelven (the old house rules being
in abeyance), which, as it was deftly replenished, seemed to go well
with whatever unforeseen combination of dishes chanced to arrive, and
undoubtedly enhanced the air of celebration. </p>
					 
<p>The surface of the table was gradually obscured by an appetising
array of foods in serving bowls, dishes and jugs: sliced meats,
casseroles, pastes, salads and cooked vegetables, pies, gravies and
dressings, supplemented by fresh fruit, pastries, trifles, sorbets and
other delicacies.</p>
					 
<p>Strag was enthusiastic. &#147;This is really good! What&#146;s in the sauce,
Yethne?&#148; </p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;Black Lattons cheese, with chives, pearl mushroom flakes and a hint
of lemon. It&#146;s quite mild.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#148;It actually complements rescued trout very well.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>A slightly indignant grunt issued from the trout supplier, whose
mouth was full. Yethne looked pleased.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Oh, Ruckers, that was meant as praise, for both of you. Your fishing
skills are legendary, Yethne makes exquisite sauces, and we all know
that Husspert is the craftiest cat in Snoak.&#148; </p>
					 
<p>The second grunt had a mollified nuance. Ma Wheggs smiled, and raised
her glass, whereupon everyone did the same, and Strag proposed a toast
to the temporarily exiled cat.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>WILDERFOOT</div>
					 
<p class=drop>Strag Wilderfoot had run away from Horm. At least, that&#146;s
what he
later told himself and others. As he imparted to his diary in his
eighteenth year, &#147;I&#146;ve sucked dry your thin suburban juices! I crave
richer sustenance, and will go to Snoak to seek fulfilment, friendship
and fortune!&#148; He had friends in Horm, but they did not understand his
passion for actual printed books or his obsessive need to write. Strag
had begun three novels, each one abandoned after a few chapters.
Something vital was missing. It was not ability, or serious intent, or
imagination. Could it possibly be experience? </p>
					 
<p>He had suffered the agonies of unrequited love, having fallen for
Caris Selk, a long-haired blonde girl at school who thought he was
weird, an opinion unfortunately shared by his exhausted parents. He had
been a late child, and while they had managed his upbringing to the best
of their ability, they could no longer keep up with his energy or active
mind. They had presented him with the savings accrued in his name, told
him that Marla, his maternal grandmother was moving in, and within a
week had nudged him out of the house with tearful blessings in the
direction of Snoak City, the one place they had gleaned from his
frequent impassioned monologues where he really wanted to be.</p>
					 
<p>On arrival in Snoak, Strag refreshed himself at the airport and then
headed with nervous determination for what to him was a primary focus of
intellectual discernment. </p>
					 
<p>Pentheus Sprent was not in the habit of being rudely disturbed,
especially by a teenager, but this one had been unusually persistent,
and had talked his way past several of the staff, giving plausible
reasons for his presence. While this suggested that security needed
tightening, it did show considerable initiative. The boy had got as far
as the waiting room outside Sprent&#146;s office, where he perched on the
edge of a sofa intended to induce relaxation. The screen set into
Sprent&#146;s inner door revealed a flushed-looking, lanky, dark-haired lad.
His bulky glidecart still had an attached airpod label showing he had
set out from Horm. Sprent, long experienced in interpreting a client&#146;s
state of mind from inadvertent signals, examined the boy&#146;s features. His
expression flickered between anxious hope and injured innocence. Sprent
made his decision and pressed a button. &#147;You can show the boy in,&#148; he
told his receptionist. &#147;Tell him it&#146;s safe to leave the glidecart.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>Sprent motioned him into a less voluptuous seat. Well, Mr &#133;?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Wilderfoot. Strag Wilderfoot, Mr Sprent. It&#146;s a great pleasure to
meet you, sir.&#148;</p>	 
					 
<p>&#147;Perhaps so, but I am more interested to know why you have come to
see me in such a presumptuous manner without prior invitation.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Of course. My apologies. You see, sir, my ambition is to become a
writer, and I need to be in an environment where such an aspiration is
not looked on as something abnormal, or frivolous. That is why I have
come to Snoak, and&#133;&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;You have come to Snoak from somewhere beyond the civilized
world?&#148;</p>			 
					 
<p>&#147;From Horm, sir. That&#146;s where I grew up and went to school.&#148; A trace
of chagrin was evident in Strag&#146;s voice.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s irrational to be ashamed of one&#146;s birthplace,&#148; said Sprent,
&#147;and to judge from your demeanour and vocabulary, you appear to have
benefited from your upbringing and education.&#147;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s not that I&#146;m ashamed, Mr Sprent, and I will never regret my
schooling. It&#146;s just that I seem to have exhausted whatever Horm has to
offer, and I&#146;m desperate to find a place where I can develop my talents.
That&#146;s why I came here.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>Sprent frowned. &#147;Are you expecting me to offer you a job? Without a
formal application, without evidence of your specific attainments, and
in the palpable absence of previous working experience in the publishing
field?&#148;</p>			 
					 
<p>Strag looked crestfallen. &#147;I suppose I really didn&#146;t know what to
expect, sir. In my mind the firm of Fissile and Sprent has always been,
well, a kind of fount of wisdom where I would find answers to my
questions. I&#146;m afraid my only working experience has been as editor of
the school magazine, but the contributions were not exactly of a high
literary standard. I&#146;m an avid reader, and I believe I can tell when a
piece of writing is flawed. But I&#146;m sure I still have much to learn,&#148; he
added hastily.</p>	 
					 
<p>&#147;I appreciate your honesty, Mr Wilderfoot. In return I can tell you
that we are not conceited enough to regard ourselves as a fount of
wisdom, although as you clearly appreciate, we pride ourselves on the
quality of our books. My advice to you would be to take yourself down to
Sparagulan College, where you will find that for a small fee you could
sign up for a useful six-month introductory course in publishing, run by
Dirry Tradfern, an old friend of mine. Assuming you are willing to do
that, please make an appointment here when you have completed the
course, and depending on Tradfern&#146;s assessment, you may well find there
will be an opening at Fissile and Sprent for an editorial assistant.&#148;
Sprent regarded him benevolently from beneath his bushy grey
eyebrows.</p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;That&#146;s more than I could have hoped for, Mr Sprent.&#148; Strag rose to
shake his hand. &#147;I&#146;m really grateful for your advice&#133; and for bothering
to see me.&#148;</p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;The direct approach is sometimes the best,&#147; said Pentheus Sprent.
&#147;But don&#146;t tell anyone I said that. Where are you staying in Snoak?&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Oh, I haven&#146;t looked for anywhere yet.&#148;</p>
					 
<p>&#147;Then this may save you a little time,&#148; said Sprent, going to a
shelf, opening a file and extracting a leaflet. &#147;We happen to publish
material for the College, including their approved accommodation list. I
seem to remember one of addresses is not far from here. Ah yes, there we
are. Park Street West. Name of Wheggs.&#148;</p>
					 
<div class=plate>149</div>
					 
<p class=drop>&#147;&#133; or a safety device for a sharp-edged tool?&#148; Having
enjoyed a
second portion of Cendrel&#146;s excellent trifle, Sawly&#146;s mind had suddenly
drifted back to the earlier topic.</p>
					 
<p>&#147;I can&#146;t see that reaching a large enough market,&#148; said Ruckney,
leaning back and lacing his fingers over his paunch. &#147;No, in my opinion,
it would have to be something to relieve flatulence or indigestion. That
would be bound to have popular appeal, wouldn&#146;t it?&#148; He looked round for
support.</p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;Probably not the ideal subject while we&#146;re still eating, Mr
Plitter.&#148;</p>		 
					 
<p>&#147;Eh? Oh, sorry, sorry, Ma Wheggs.&#148; Chastened, he sat back up and hung
his head glumly like a contrite child. </p>
					 
<p>&#147;Tact was never your strong suit, Ruckers,&#148; snorted Sawly, his own
tongue a little loosened by the strength of the emberskelven. </p>
					 
<p>Cendrel, by now also distinctly merrier, had tuned in fuzzily to the
conversation. She raised an index finger and wagged it knowingly. &#147;But
he does have one. He told me!&#148; </p>
					 
<p>&#147;Has one what, dear?&#148; enquired Ma Wheggs.</p>
					 
<p>Cendrel leaned towards her former landlady and confided in a dramatic
whisper: &#147;A stroot!&#148; She frowned and shook her head. &#147;I mean suit. A
really, really strong suit! Made of coly&#133; polycarbine fibles.&#148; Satisfied
that she had correctly remembered the technical term, she beamed at
Ruckney, and was rewarded with a knowing wink.</p>
					 
<div class=plate>PLITTER</div>
					 
<p class=drop>He did indeed have a top-of-the-range protective suit, the
material
spun from synthetic polyamides developed during his third year with the
Advanced Fabrics team at Central&#146;s research labs. Although the suit was
still officially the property of Central, as its sole wearer he had been
the favoured recipient for its long-term loan after large-scale
production of the final design had been approved for industrial and
scientific use, and advance orders received from, among others,
smelters, chemical factories, fire departments, hazardous waste handlers
and the odd vulcanologist. </p> <P><p>Following his apprenticeship he had helped modify and improve the
automated processing machinery, and was one of the eager volunteers
selected to have a prototype suit fitted for practical testing. During
this experimental phase he had been obliged to respect a confidentiality
agreement not to discuss technical details outside the workplace. </p> <P><p>The suit was lightweight, flexible, heat- and water-resistant, had
high tensile strength and was electrically non-conductive. Equipped with
matching gloves and face-shield Ruckney had walked through fire, been
exposed to splashes of molten glass and metal, languished in tanks of
various liquid compounds, and survived contact with high voltage sparks.
Relieved to have emerged unscathed from these trials, he was happy to
commend use of such suits by anyone working in extreme conditions, and
felt he had earned the opportunity to try his out in the (slightly) less
dangerous confines of the garage back home in Drether&#146;s Wheen. It was
there that his precious landshrinker grew by increments over a two-year
period as he was able to obtain parts from scrapyards and specialist
dealers during holidays and occasional week-ends. </p> <P><p>This landshrinker was not a thing of beauty, but had a
straightforward blunt practicality that reflected the character of its
owner. It was strong, capacious and solidly dependable, powered by a
quartet of Kjold inertial engines (formerly used to drive a freight
transporter), which could be independently engaged to provide either
backup redundancy or extra thrust when required. It was a vehicle
adapted for the freedom of travel across wind-scoured terrain with an
unobstructed view of the horizon, but so far had made only comparatively
short journeys into populated areas, and had yet to be properly
unleashed. Ruckney harboured plans for a long-distance trip when his
spell of work as a consultant engineer at Smode&#146;s Extrusions (on the
outskirts of Drether&#146;s Wheen) came to an end early the following year.
He&#146;d been thinking of inviting Sawly to join him, if the man was willing
to be parted long enough from his skimmer.</p> <P><div class=plate>VEXT</div> <P><p class=drop>No-one would deny the fascination of fire, but as a boy
Sawly&#146;s
curiosity with what could be made to burn resulted (understandably) in
anxious parental warnings and frequent checks for any fire-making
devices. Being resourceful, he maintained a couple of convenient outdoor
hiding-places, known only to trusted friends (behind a broken brick in
the stump of a wall, the ivy-screened hollow of a tree). Here were
stored flints, convex lenses, tufts of steel wool, candle stubs, thin
tubular objects gnarled by heat beyond the recognition of all save
fellow experimenters or forensic specialists. An enthusiastic science
teacher at school had inadvertently intensified Sawly&#146;s interest in
chemistry by heralding a practical laboratory demonstration with phrases
such as &#147;extreme caution&#148;, &#147;on no account&#148;, and &#147;never without adult
supervision&#148;. Certain powdered substances had been combined, a simple
fuse attached, and ignited at arm&#146;s length by a taper. Standing back at
a safe distance the class was treated to a fountain of sparks, a
spectacularly colourful explosion and a pall of satisfyingly acrid
smoke. Sawly had followed the preparations with unusual attention, and
found himself wondering whether chemistry might become more than a
hobby.</p>
		 
<p>Another significant epiphany occurred on a school visit to Snoak City
Museum, long before it acquired its international reputation with the
acquisition of the fabled Trox Bequest. He had no particular reverence
for very old things, be they stuffed dead animals, shards of pottery,
monumental statues or corroded weaponry, even when tastefully displayed
with helpful explanatory notes. He might have admitted to a vague
fascination with some of the unusual rocks and minerals, with their
strange crystalline growths or glittering facets, but what really opened
his mind that day was in the section devoted to glass. </p>
		 
<p>He had always taken glass objects for granted, without giving any
thought to their manufacture. Bottles, jars, bowls, glasses, ornaments,
windows, mirrors, bulbs, lenses: things in everyday use he had never
bothered to think much about until his attention was drawn to one
particular item in that museum; a slender round-shouldered translucent
vase on a plinth base. The surface was etched with fine tendril-like
striations which had the effect of refracting the light so that the vase
appeared both to glow and sparkle at the same time. Sawly remembered
staring at the vase, entranced, before glancing at the label which
detailed its probable history, concluding with a reminder that this
ancient craftsmanship, like all glass-making, depended on the ability to
fuse quartz. Quartz was something with which Sawly was familiar from the
annual family holiday in Platport. He had spent many idle hours on
Platport beach, exploring, excavating and building short-lived
labyrinths and palaces from the same raw material, the same gritty,
slithering grains which could be transformed with the addition of a few
chemical compounds and a little skill, he realized with dawning
amazement, into something as breathtaking as that vase. Without
question, this was the skill he wanted to learn.</p>
		 
<p>Snoak Glassworks took on very few new apprentices. Craft glassmaking
was a very specialized discipline, requiring good hand-eye
co-ordination, a sound understanding of the underlying science and a
strong aesthetic sense. However, the Vext lad had arrived with a
portfolio of designs, very favourable references from the art and
science teachers at his school in Trevury, along with a letter of
commendation from the head, saying that he had rarely known a pupil with
such determination, whose abilities so closely matched the career he
hoped to pursue. Morsyl Tammer, the chief designer, was grudgingly
impressed, and had agreed to offer Sawly a month&#146;s trial, with a modest
advance to cover living expenses. He was confident that the tourist
bureau at Central would have details of suitable lodgings, which indeed
proved to be the case. </p>
		 
<div class=plate>149</div>
		 
<p class=drop>After the meal Ma Wheggs had ushered them out of the
kitchen, and
they had retired to what they used to call the floproom. It was
essentially an informal library, with shelving on three walls. To an
initial nucleus of well-loved books, many previous guests, for the most
part students and trainees, had contributed a book or two of their own
before leaving. Under house rules, it was expected that borrowed books
would eventually be returned, but there were no penalties for default.
The net result was that the library had become by increments both a
useful educational resource and a treasury of surprises. A manual on
knot-making might rub shoulders with a textbook on hydrostatics, a Seff
Haldergath spy thriller, or a book of verse by Oxwell Gimbloss. The
central oval table was the only unobscured item of furniture. Ma Wheggs
periodically enhanced the original seating with fresh batches of
decorative cushions, so that it was often a matter of guesswork as to
what lay beneath, but there was always somewhere comfortable to sprawl,
and usually something interesting to read. </p>
		 
<p>On the lower shelves were propped some small framed holos, nostalgic
reminders of departed predecessors waving and smiling. Higher up, and
therefore less accessible, were a few older Wheggs family holos. Yethne,
feeling slightly light-headed and emboldened, had removed her shoes and
scrambled up a hill of plump cushions to peer up at the one which
featured a tall young man gazing down at the upturned face of his
partner, who was smiling back at him. They were at some kind of outdoor
evening celebration. She reached up carefully and brought it down for a
closer look, thumbing the side panel to activate it. Somewhere just
off-screen a band was playing; she caught a partial glimpse of blue and
gold uniforms. Behind the couple people were dancing. In the distance,
fireworks bloomed and showered, briefly illuminating a segment of what
appeared to be the Stadium. Yethne clambered down with as much decorum
as possible, and held it out for the rest of them to see.</p>
		 
<p>They clustered round.</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Wow! &#146;That looks like a young version of&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Do you suppose&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;It&#146;s not a version. That&#146;s definitely Ma Wheggs, but she looks
so&#133;&#148;</p> 
		 
<p>&#147;&#133;so happy. And so does that rather good-looking fellow. Is
that&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Of course! It must be Pa Wheggs. Before he&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Before the accident.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Accident? I didn&#146;t know. What accident?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;The bloating accident. He was the official Troller. At Praspafole
Stadium. For ten years or more.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;I never knew that. How did I never know that? I often wondered what
became of him.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Well, she doesn&#146;t care to talk about it, even after all these years,
which is understandable.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Do you know what happened?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;The pitch was rock-hard. It was late season, and the ground had
frozen overnight, but they wouldn&#146;t think of cancelling a game. You know
how resilient bloat players are. The perimeter glider malfunctioned; it
accelerated unexpectedly, he was thrown off and landed head first.
Suffered severe concussion, despite his head-pad. In a coma for weeks,
but sadly never recovered.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Oh, that&#146;s awful. Poor chap. And poor Ma Wheggs!&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;I think she would have received compensation, but imagine having to
deal with the loss&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;It must have been ghastly for her. How did you get her to tell
you?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Actually I didn&#146;t, but Fissile &amp; Sprent have an old-fashioned
datafile full of local news reports, and I chanced to spot the name
Wheggs in the index. </p>
		 
<p>&#147;We&#146;d better put the holo back.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;I&#146;ll do it.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Thanks, Ruckney. Shoes!&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;What? Oh, yes.&#148;</p>
		 
<div class=plate>FARFYLE</div>
		 
<p class=drop>Black Lattons had been home to the Farfyles for as long as
anyone
could remember. It was an agricultural community, and, if you were a
Farfyle, the answer to most problems ultimately lay in the nutrient-rich
soil, fed by the upper reaches of the Stirrow as it wound through the
sheltered valley. The farms were largely self-sufficient, and their
high-quality produce and traditional hand-made craftwork were readily
traded or sold for any required items not available locally. It was an
idyllic spot, where human activity was geared to the daily movement of
the sun and the largely predictable pattern of the seasons. The work was
hard but rewarding, and Yethne, like her great-uncle Grome before her,
could not wait to be somewhere else, where you were not woken at dawn by
the ear-piercing yells of a mad-eyed bird, or obliged to muck out
unending quantities of smelly animal droppings before most sensible
people had eaten their breakfast.</p>
	 
<p>According to family legend, as soon as he was of a suitable age,
great-uncle Grome, who was allergic to feathers, pollen, sawdust,
animals, straw, and it seems anything else remotely relating to
agriculture, who was also prone to insomnia and blessed (or afflicted)
with sensitive hearing, had made it quite clear that he had an
irresistible urge to experience a completely different environment. True
to his word, he embarked on an ocean-going vessel bound for the southern
seas, working his passage as a galley-hand, and ended up on a remote
island, where, as a surviving handful of his subsequent letters
testified, he became proficient at diving for shellfish, inventing
cocktails and occasionally helping out at the weather station.</p>
	 
<p>Yethne Farfyle was just as motivated, but less inclined to plunge
into the unknown. Other than farming, the only profession she had had
the opportunity to observe at all closely was teaching. Apart from the
irascible Mrs Nullark with her glass eye and uncanny ability to identify
miscreants, all her teachers had been kind, reasonably cheerful, patient
people, who had tried to instil in their charges a love of learning, or
at the very least a vague curiosity and a useful smattering of basic
skills. She rather fancied being a teacher. It would be just like
helping the tinies to tell the time, or explaining difficult words to
her friend Morette, except that she would be paid, and still have
holidays. </p>
	 
<p>After a little research she discovered that even teachers had to
spend some time learning how to teach properly, and that would mean her
having to go to somewhere like Trevury or Meheric, or the famous
Sparagulan College in Snoak. She had been to Snoak two or three times
when she was younger. Memories of the first visit were rather hazy. She
suspected she might have slept through the entire trip. The other two
visits had been birthday treats; one to see a stage show, with live
music and dancers in dazzling floaty costumes. The third occasion had
been on her twelfth birthday, when she was allowed to spend her own
money at Snoak City market. That had been very satisfying. The more she
thought about it, the more appealing was the idea of living in Snoak.
She would need to persuade her parents, but they knew she was old enough
to make up her own mind. She was not quite sure whether it would further
her cause to mention great-uncle Grome. </p>
	 
<div class=plate>149</div>
	 
<p class=drop>The atmosphere in the floproom was comfortably soporific.
Tebbi and
Cendrel, both currently unattached, were casually discussing the virtues
and deficiencies of past boyfriends. Strag and Yethne were engrossed in
a well-loved children&#146;s book (&#145;The very small <b>SHOUTING</b> Box&#146;).
Ruckney had drifted into a light doze while waiting for Sawly to make up
his mind about joining him on the proposed overland journey in the
landshrinker. Sawly, who also had his eyes shut, was thinking aloud.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;&#133;well, I&#146;m building up a decent reserve stock of the best-selling
designs, like the perfume-bottles and paperweights, and towards the end
of the year I&#146;ll be able to concentrate on special commissions. And the
skimmer&#146;s been in good shape, since I fixed the leak. So by next Spring
I should have some free time for travel, although being stuck with each
other in your monster of a vehicle for any length of time might drive us
both loopy. Still, if you&#146;re prepared to risk it, Ruckers&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>Ruckney stirred. &#147;Hmmph?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;The question is, do you really want to risk it?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Nngh. Hrrrm. No thanks, I&#146;m really full.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Ruckers?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Hm?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;What did I just ask you?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Did I want a biscuit?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Go back to sleep.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>Ruckney yawned and checked the time on a fingernail display. &#147;I&#146;d
better not. I&#146;ll need to be heading back shortly to avoid the commuter
traffic.&#148; He reached into a pocket for his nultox and tongued a tab.
&#147;Whatever did people do before we had these?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Suffered from sore heads and stayed off the roads, I expect. Listen,
Ruckers, about that trip: it sounds like it might be fun. We&#146;ve still
got plenty of time to discuss details, but I meant to ask you if you&#146;d
done anything yet about noise dampening. I&#146;ve fitted out the skimmer
with these really effective acoustic panels&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p class=drop>&#147;Clage&#133;.? Wispy moustache and snorty laugh?&#148; </p>
	 
<p>&#147;Like a flustered goose? No, that would be &#145;Foghorn&#146; Flade. Clage is
quieter, taller, better dressed, usually in muted colours. Dark hair,
blue eyes, slender hands&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Is that Clage? He was at Guyl&#146;s party in Yarp Street. I thought he
looked bewildered. Guyl had a deafening waterfall hoto playing, so there
was a bit of a sensory overload, and no chance of conversation.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Guyl&#146;s rather fun. Were you and he&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;No, Tebs, not really. Well, we had a mild flirtation, nothing
serious. Now what about you and Clage?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Ah, that&#146;s complicated&#133;&#148;</p> <P><p class=drop>Strag turned the last page, their heads almost
touching.
	 
<blockquote><i>"And after that they rinsed it clean and
dabbed it
dry with a scrap of cloth the colour of the sky, and put it on a stout
cork mat. They listened very hard. The little box was as empty as ever,
and it was quite, quite silent. So they wrapped it up and took it back
to the place by the pool. Under the tree with the drooping boughs where
the brown bird sang its solitary song, they lifted the stone that hid
the hole where the box had lain for so very long. Into the ground, with
scrupulous care, they placed the little box, and hid the hole with the
heavy stone. As they made their way home a gust of wind blew a swirl of
leaves over the spot with a whispery sound.</i></p>
	 
<p><i>"Traveller, should you pass this way, and see that tree with its
drooping boughs and lone brown bird beside the pool, and find the stone
that hides the hole, take care! For if you hear, however faint, the
sound of shouting somewhere near, go very quickly from that place. But
if you stay, my friend, beware! Beware the dark enchantment in the
air."</i></p> </blockquote>
	 
<p>Strag closed the book, and Yethne wiped away a tear with the back of
her hand.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Such a strange ending.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;I know. But didn&#146;t you always secretly want to find the box?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Of course I did! Didn&#146;t you?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;I used to slip down to Horm pond and poke about with a stick in the
hope of finding the right stone, but the ground was soggy, the trees
were the wrong kind, too far away, and home to squadrons of bad-tempered
crows.&#148;</p>
	 
<p class=drop>Their wistful moment was interrupted by the re-appearance
of Ma
Wheggs, bearing a tray of small home-made confections in little bags
which she placed on the table for her guests to take back with them. She
was closely followed by the devious Husspert, recent misbehaviour
evidently forgiven, who leaped onto the nearest vacant cushion,
immediately adopting that nonchalantly undignified attitude in which a
hind leg points to the zenith, while contorted ablutions are
performed.</p>
	 
<p>It was time to go. Before long the current band of lodgers would be
returning from their work or studies. &#147;Still a little wet behind the
ears compared to you, my loves,&#148; confided Ma Wheggs, &#147;but not entirely
without promise.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Well, they couldn&#146;t be in better hands, Ma Wheggs, as I&#146;m sure we&#146;d
all agree,&#148; said Strag, helping Yethne on with her coat. There was
general assent, as they all gathered their belongings and shared a
reciprocal hug with their favourite landlady on their way to the front
door.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;You two girls behave yourselves, now.&#148; Addressed to Tebbi and
Cendrel, this instruction, much like the admonitions to Husspert,
carried the implication that she had done her best, but could not be
held responsible for the inevitable lapses of judgment that lay ahead.
</p> 
	 
<p>&#147;Now, Mr Plitter and Mr Vext, my young speedsters. Promise me you&#146;ll
take good care of yourselves, and those vehicles of yours.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Without a doubt, Ma Wheggs.&#148; &#147;Any time you want to come for a
ride&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>She smiled. &#147;That&#146;s very kind, but you know how busy I&#146;m kept
here&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Dear Mr Wilderfoot, our man of letters, lovely to have you back, if
only for half a day. And Yethne, my dear&#133;&#148; She leaned closer to murmur
in Yethe&#146;s ear. &#147;You could do a lot worse, you know. He dotes on you, in
case you haven&#146;t noticed.&#148; Yethne&#146;s eyes widened, and her sudden flush
was hidden from Strag by the upturned collar of her coat. </p>
	 
<p>They gathered at the foot of the path, sheepishly reluctant to
disperse into the late Spring afternoon, still suffused with the
residual inner glow induced by a return to No.149. </p>
	 
<p>&#147;Strange to think I was barely out of school when I first came
here.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Well, after all, this was our second home,&#148; said Tebbi. &#147;We all had
a lot of growing up to do.&#147; </p>
	 
<p>Sawly half-jokingly suggested that it was a complete mystery how they
ever survived each other&#146;s company for so long.</p>
	 
<p>&#145;I mean, what with Ruckers being so stubborn, and quite out of
control,&#148; he added, mischievously.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;And you so preoccupied with your designs you could barely manage
more than five or six slices of toast at breakfast...&#148;</p>
	 
<p>The rest of them hastened to join in.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;&#133;and Cen so suspiciously quiet, but wildly impulsive&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Oh, dangerously so..&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;&#133;and Tebbi so loftily self-possessed&#133;&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;Virtually unflappable! I tried to make her flap, but failed
miserably.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>&#147;That&#146;s because I need the wind under my wings, Strag. Hot air simply
isn&#146;t enough. Speaking of hot air, what about Yethne, keeping us all
awake with lectures on crop rotation?&#148;</p>
	 
<p>Strag couldn&#146;t resist interjecting. &#147;Ah yes, how to spin a turnip.
The very memory leaves me faint.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>Suppressing a giggle, Yethne was quick to respond. &#147;And so it should,
Strag, considering that turnip-spinning became so popular it had to be
banned by the Society for the Protection of Abused Vegetables.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>As their mingled shadows slowly lengthened, a moment&#146;s respectful
silence greeted the mention of this adroitly conjured organization, and
by consensus Yethne was awarded an unspecified but generously large
number of imaginary points. This accolade served as a cue for departure.
Cendrel and Tebbi opted to head for the park, Sawly said he might as
well accompany Ruckney back to the landshrinker, since it was not too
far from Lemp&#146;s Runnel, where his skimmer was moored. Yethne had a
little research to do for a school project, but still had a day in hand,
and was happy to comply with Strag&#146;s offhandedly hopeful suggestion that
she might like to help him choose a present for his grandmother&#146;s
birthday. They set off in the direction of the market, chatting
amicably, walking companionably close together. Afterwards neither of
them could quite remember who had first put an arm round the other&#146;s
waist, or how, by the time they had reached the market, their fingers
had somehow become agreeably intertwined. </p>
	 
<p class=drop>The micropod had gently disgorged its last cargo in the
dropbox outside the Wilderfoot house in Horm, provoking an unusual stir
of activity. </p>
	 
<p>Pled Wilderfoot handed the parcel to his mother-in-law, who set about
slowly peeling away the layers of packaging, disclosing at last a
glimpse of something sleekly furred. </p>
	 
<p>&#147;Why would anyone want to send you a dead rabbit, Marla?&#148; asked Pled,
with impish innocence.</p>
	 
<p>With a squeak of fright the old lady hastily pushed the offending
gift off her lap, while her wearily unamused daughter came to her
rescue.</p>
	 
<p>&#147;&#145;Take no notice of him, mother. Pled thinks he&#146;s being funny.&#148; She
cast him a reproving glance and retrieved the d&#233;bris from the floor,
separating the wrapping paper from what was evidently a pair of
slippers. </p>
	 
<p>&#147;Here mother, it&#146;s a pair of thermoderms, with a little note from
Strag.&#148;</p>
	 
<p>Marla composed herself, affecting an air of injured dignity, while
allowing her daughter to fit the slippers on her stockinged feet.
Something akin to a sigh signified that she was not displeased. She read
