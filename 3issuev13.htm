<div><i>If it looks real and feels real, do you think it matters if
it's real? <small>-- Daniel Nayeri</small></i>
<p class="drop">It was one of Snoak City's quieter attractions.   <P>It might have been the effect of its comparative isolation, or the
sparse external lighting, but the building, despite its unusual
solidity, gave the appearance of being drab and possibly in need of
repair.  It was difficult to know exactly what needed to be fixed.  The
curving walls were of rough grey local stone, with patches of moss where
it was less weathered.  The turreted roof was slated, and fitted with
guttering and downpipes in a style long out of fashion, but evidently
still serviceable.  A helical series of recessed shuttered squares wound
around its circumference, reaching almost to the roof.  These could have
been ventilation ducts, for there were no glazed windows.  At ground
level on the western side, a shallow alcove housed a black painted door,
inset with a sturdy grille, and decorated with ornamental brass studs in
the form of small turtles.  Above the door was affixed a dusty sign,
hand-lettered in gilt, cobwebbed at the corners, stating: SMOLEHIVE'S
ANAKALYPTOSCOPE.  <small>Admission Free</small> <P>In truth, visitors were few, even at the height of the tourist season.
This was partly due to the fact that the beturtled door was, more often
than not, kept locked.  There were opening days, but these varied, and
were never advertised.  At hours of his own choosing an elderly
caretaker would arrive on foot bearing a bunch of keys and a heavy bag
from which, according to one report, a fruit of some kind had once
accidentally fallen.  Or it could have been a potato.  Once open, the
door revealed a flight of stairs with stout handrails on either side,
leading up to the viewing chamber.  A brightly chalked arrow on the
inner wall at the height of an average buttock helpfully pointed the
way.  This may have been intended to favour those of small stature, or
had perhaps been inscribed by a child (possibly under supervision, for
it was carefully drawn), or a dwarf confident in his or her semiotic
skills. <P>The caretaker (Smolehive himself, perhaps) had not bothered to attach a
sign that declared the establishment open or closed.  His reasoning, one
assumes, is that once the door was unlocked, and the meticulous arrow
visible, such a declaration would have been redundant.  The open door
was an invitation, and the infrequency of this occurrence a positive
incentive to interested passers by, should they chance to notice it.
Among other reasons why it was largely ignored, was that the building
was some way off the beaten track, being situated near the eastern edge
of Whissit Fields, separated by a marshy bend of the Stirrow from the
glassworks further upstream, and half hidden by a high wall from the
outlying workshops surrounding the octagonal complex of Central.   <P>For the select few who happened to arrive after the door had been
opened, a further problem immediately presented itself.  It was usually
expressed in the form of stares, which ranged from the totally blank to
the deeply quizzical.  Take, for example, the five wandering tourists
who had been trying to locate the brewery, idly pursuing the
unmistakable odour of fermenting hops.  Their casual flamboyance and
exaggerated laughter suggested that they were students, probably from
Platport or Meheric.  From where they had paused near the open doorway,
the brewery was still a good half-hour&#146;s wander to the north west.  The
phalanx of brass turtles had swung back.  One of the visitors pointed to
the quaint calligraphy.  Another spotted the imperative arrow.  A brief
discussion followed, involving a quintuple exchange of shrugs.  It was
probably the free admission that proved persuasive.  They ventured in. <P>The stairs led anticlockwise around a wide central column, in which
semi-opaque, sightly convex discs of glass, the size of saucers, had
been set at regular intervals, like blind portholes.  Curiously, they
appeared to be lit from within by natural daylight, and allowed
sufficient illumination for the climb up into the viewing chamber.
Here, within a round wooden enclosure, Smolehive (if it was he) sat
hunched in a comfortable high-backed pivoted chair, his attention fixed
on an angled panel of polished wood furbished with a constellation of
calibrated dials, each with its neatly hand-written label set in a brass
bracket.  He wore what appeared to be earmuffs, and made no obvious
acknowledgement of his visitors.. <P>Like the stair column, the wall was inset with framed frosted glass
discs, but these were as big as dinner plates, and formed a continuous
row, like a gallery of portraits.  As the caretaker made small
adjustments to his dials, these &#145;windows&#146; began to fill with images of
Snoak City.  This in itself was not especially remarkable.  Everyone had
e-screens, and reconnaissance pods had been in use for years, both
commercially and for security purposes.  But there was a quality about
these silent images that distinguished them from the norm.  Clarity,
depth of colour, detail &#150; all of these, and an extra indefinable
dimension that seemed to heighten their reality. <P><p class="drop">The five students progressed slowly round the room,
absorbed by the shifting panoramic view&#133;. <P>A hypnotic shimmer of light, the focus gradually withdrawing to  reveal
the wind-rippled surface of the reservoir, and beside it the burnished
pipes and tanks of the Frusk water-purification plant.  Uniformed
engineers can be seen intent on their maintenance duties.  Among
neatly-tended shrubs two executives wearing orange security passes
appear to be arguing.  One is visibly agitated, and seems to be anxious
to leave.  The other points above his head to where an intercity
airship is lifting eastward into a cloudless sky. <P>The next panel retraces its trajectory back to the airport, where a line
of passengers can be seen embarking on a privately-chartered vessel; all
well-dressed, unsmiling, pensive, some clutching slim document cases.
Most likely a team of cartographers reluctantly bound for Smatparrox.
It is rumoured that capricious illicit landscaping has been taking place
there on an unprecedented scale, financed by someone with enormous
wealth.  All that is publicly known about this so far unidentified
figure is that he or she is said to have metallic hair.  The vessel's
bright bulbous flank quivers as the tethers are released, reflecting the
threading paths of busy vehicles amid clusters of activity on the ground
as the pilot steers high over the old motorway in the direction of
Ratman's Fork, the subject of the next image. <P>Here we look down on grey smoke, whirling sparks carried on gusts.  A
ramshackle heap of splintered wood, some with old paint visibly bubbling
as it burns.  Charred d&eacute;bris glows among the blown ashes:
springs, door-handles, wire mesh, a half-consumed book.  The image
briefly magnifies, showing crisped blackened pages with glimmering
edges, precise columns of neat handwriting flickering with a coppery
sheen before disintegrating.  The pile judders as something large and
heavy is thrown on.  The focus pulls back.  Grinning urchins caper
around the fire, created on waste ground among the abandoned warehouses.
Several wield poking sticks &#150; tubular metal poles which experience has
taught them to insulate at the holding end with swathes of cloth.  A
girl, face grimy with soot, is attempting with intense concentration to
toast a bun speared on a twig.  There are no adults to be seen. <P>The next scene pans swiftly past Sparrink's Yard, haunt of tinkerers
and thrifty handymen, back across Praspafole Stadium, empty apart from
the Quicksilver service crew removing detritus left by spectators.  We
are plunged into a glittery arcade.  It has to be Yarp Street. Glass
cabinets blaze with polished minerals, tasteful arrangements of
semi-precious stones, sculpted metal objects standing on plinths;
tortuous quasi-human figures expressing angst or hinting at desire.
Discreet price-tags confirm that they are intended for an exclusive
client&egrave;le.  A brightly-lit interior reveals a profusion of exotic
tie-dyed silk scarves, pinned and draped gracefully in simulation of a
waterfall.  A hand reaches in to lift one of these, slim fingers
freighted with rings. <P>An eye.  Reddish-brown iris, with a small black pupil.  Around it a
thin, slightly puckered ring of pastel blue, softening to pale grey as
the view slowly recedes to disclose a roosting collared-dove in dense
foliage.  It is seen through the rainbow haze above the fountain at
Sparagulan College, so must be at the northern end of Garrible Park, an
area favoured by those with a taste for secluded private properties, and
the means to acquire and maintain them.  In the foreground are the
mullioned windows of one of the college towers.  The carved stonework
shows signs of erosion. <P>Here are glimpses of a street market, partly obscured by coloured
awnings.  Fresh produce, hand-crafted goods, bright bouquets.  Small
children strapped in trundlers blink at the moving forest of legs, while
a small crowd stands watching a bouncing hat.  Under it is a young
street musician, sitting on a wooden box on the sides of which he is
drumming with his hands, eyes squeezed shut.  Beside him a young woman
with cropped blonde hair is playing a tall instrument with great
dexterity and obvious enjoyment.  One foot, neatly shod in soft green
leather with silver laces, taps the ground in soundless syncopation. <P>We are now near the city&#146;s southern edge, over the bridge near Thrissop
Hill, and a procession of SunCell MonoPods, like a string of bright
beads, heads south to compete at the Gat Whane circuit.  This season&#146;s
colour is predominantly a vibrant blue, though the fad for spotty blooms
in mimicry of an irritated squid has not quite died away.  One renegade
is a defiant matt black (except for the transparent forward segment),
either hinting at hidden power, or a misguided attempt to remain
inconspicuous, since each SCMP has its tail fin emblazoned with the
owner&#146;s identifying emblem, in this instance a kind of bent trident.
Under closer scrutiny this turns out to be the three toes of a sloth, so
the driver may be making an ironic statement.   <P>Scuttling across a tree-lined road, yet another escaped pangolin.  In
its eager but so far thwarted search for an ant colony it finds
temporary shelter under a hedge which borders the grounds of Greeming
&amp; Trulph (Accessories).  &#145;Conservation gone mad!&#146; the Quanderpyre
press would later comment, under the headline &#145;Menace of the Scaly
Invaders&#146;. <P>The view sweeps across rooftops, intersections, orchards, farms, lingers
briefly at the flat, restless horizon, then pulls back across the marina
to witness a man emerging without luggage from the covered walkway of a
private flotel.  He wears an unseasonably long dark coat.  A nimbus of
bronze hair obscures his features.  He pauses at the roadside, briefly
lifting a gloved hand to his face.  The passenger door of a waiting
vehicle, a bluish-grey Dap Pulsar, slides open.  As he climbs in with
practiced ease we see the glint of a tinted visor.  The driver&#146;s face is
not visible, but the gold bracelet on her wrist is finely crafted in the
form of entwined snakes.  The vehicle moves smoothly towards the
Southern Underpass. <P>An impossible view, surely!  There is no snow-covered mountain within a
day&#146;s flight from Snoak City.  It must be a clever model.  The textures
are very convincing, as is the lighting, which brings out the contrast
of starkly black and bruise-coloured shadows against blue-white snow.
Even the impression of distant wind-blown drifts is realistic.  One
might almost imagine the coloured specks strung along that oblique ridge
to be miniature mountaineers.  The modeller has somehow contrived to
produce the effect of clouds shredding around the summit.  You would
swear that those specks have subtly changed their position.  It is as
well that the whole thing is artificial, for  above them that descending
puff seems to be accreting, and now erases them from view as it shudders
noiselessly down to the tree-line. <P><p class="drop">A series of clicks at the control panel coincides with
these scenes flicking off in succession, provoking involuntary yelps of
disappointment from the students.  Smolehive (if it is he) inclines his
head gravely as they respectfully move past him on their way to the
stairs, idle thoughts of the brewery long since evaporated.  As they
leave he permits himself a smile, reaches into his bag and using both
hands extracts something dark, smooth but knurled, slightly pitted.  A
meteorite?  A cherished product of taxidermy?  Perhaps a fruit of some
kind.  Or it could be a potato. <P><small>&copy; L. J. Sklaroff 2013 All Rights Reserved </small>
