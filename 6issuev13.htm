<div align=center><img src="myksos.jpg"><BR><h2>Sibyl</h2><BR><h3>Les Sklaroff</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>It's all true. Look it up.</i>
<p class="drop">Myksos was full of noises, though they
were not all sweet enough to send Caliban back to sleep.  The
high-pitched pulsing of cicadas, roars from argumentative old men
comfortably pissed on ouzo, bursts of karaoke from bleary tourists
fobbed off with cheap retsina, tavernas blaring bazouki music amplified
beyond sensible recognition.  And of course the persistent wash of the
Aegean lapping against the surrounding shoreline. <P>Inland, beyond the groves of twisted olive trees, dull bells clanked
from scrawny livestock on the hillside.  Higher, hidden from the ground
by stony outcrops, halfway up the steep seaward-facing slope where a few
thorny shrubs had rooted in rock clefts, a trick of the wind gave rise
to a deep hollow fluting as it gusted fitfully across the narrow
entrance of a concealed cave.  This inhuman sound was once believed to
be the voice of a Sibyl. <P>After some months of bureaucratic delay, Garron had eventually been
granted official access to the site.  Local inhabitants avoided the
area, whether through lingering superstition or simple inertia, he did
not know.  For whatever reasons, no research had been done here in
recent times.  Unlike the legendary oracles at Delphi or Cumaea there
was no record of association with Apollo, or indeed with any other deity
from the archaic pantheon.  It was this anomaly, coupled with the Myksos
Sibyl&#146;s gnomic prophecy about burning stones, that had first piqued
Garron&#146;s curiosity. <P>Clouded by legend, the origin of Sibyls dates back to the Bronze Age.
According to the Roman scholar Varro their generic name derives from the
Doric form &#145;<I>sios bylla</I>&#146; of the Greek &#145;<I>theos boule</I>&#146;,
meaning &#145;she that tells the will of Zeus&#146;, although this is now disputed
by etymologists.  Traditionally female, divinely inspired, they were
given to blurting out ecstatic predictions, a behaviour which some say
was the result of inhaling narcotic gases.   <P>Under the Romans the original Sibylline Books, written in Greek verse,
were guarded by life-long custodians in the Temple of Jupiter on the
Capitoline Hill.  They would consult the oracles and prescribe
appropriate rituals to avert calamities.  Unfortunately the temple was
destroyed by fire in 83 BC, and only fragments of these oracles
survived.  A subsequent collection was made, and duly consulted for the
next four hundred years, but these too were eventually burned, this time
for political reasons. <P>Texts mentioning the Myksos Sibyl are very few, but they agree on
her oracular words: &#147;&#964;&#951;&#957;
&#949;&#960;&#943;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#958;&#951;
&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#953;&#957;
&#945;&#960;&#972; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#973;&#949;&#962;
&#960;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#962;
&#966;&#941;&#961;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#957;
&#966;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#940;&#148;, which translate roughly as &#147;Grow wise
before the cold stones burn.&#148;  No-one had been able to make sense of
this apparent instruction.  Garron hoped that by exploring the site he might
at least stumble upon a clue. <P><p class="drop">Among those visitors who strayed off the hill path favoured by goats,
even the most intrepid climbers, finding footholds to be unusually
treacherous, soon chose less precipitous routes.  But Garron had trained
with a rescue team in the Cairngorms led by the redoubtable Andy McKyle,
a scrupulously safety-conscious instructor.  After making a careful
study of the terrain, Garron had discovered a way down from the top;
difficult but accessible, especially with the benefit of his lightweight
climbing gear. <P>There was nothing to indicate the nature of the site; no ruined walls,
no ceremonial markings, no evidence of cultivation.  Whatever there was
to be found had to be within.  As he manoeuvred himself to peer into the
recessed cave-mouth a penetrating shaft of sunlight caught the green
iridescence of a beetle's wing-case.  It glowed like a dropped jewel
against the dark interior.  Garron smiled approvingly.  <I>A
proprietary talisman</I>, he thought.   <P>The entrance was narrow.  Easing his torso cautiously through to its
inner ledge he flicked on his headlamp.  At first the light dissipated
into sheer emptiness.  He shifted his cramped position, accidentally
dislodging some loose fragments from the ledge.  Trying to keep the
powerful beam focussed, he watched them plunge silently into the abyss.
<I>No wonder others have been deterred from exploring this place.  </I>
As the light swept down into the unmeasured depths Garron swore softly
to himself when he suddenly glimpsed what was illuminated at the very
foot, and knew he had to make the descent. <P>It took him nearly an hour, keeping to bedrock ridges, ensuring the
security of ropes for what would be an even more strenuous climb back
up.  As he slowly neared level ground he entered a realm of baroque
splendour; a receding vista of rock formations infused with a display of
subtle colours.  From the sloping ceiling there appeared to hang
draperies like frozen aurorae, interspersed with a forest of cones,
needles and more robust columns.  There were what looked like outcrops
of glistening coral, pillars festooned with spiral ornamentation,
tapering spires rising from the distant floor, where the fantastic
lithic architecture was reflected by a still pool, half obscured by a
series of platforms or terraces, each with its own surreal
configurations.  Garron knew that he was witnessing the results
of thousands of years of geological processes.  <I>Could these be the
cold stones? </I> He was aware that many of the apparently solid
structures, so long undisturbed, were brittle enough to shatter if
struck accidentally.  His feet finally touched the surface about fifty
metres from the clear pool, which he saw was enclosed by a natural
rimstone dam.  The sound created by the wind far above had now become an
intermittent bellowing, which echoed and re-echoed among the encrusted
columns.  Even after the the echoes had faded he imagined he could sense
a residual pulse which continied to resonate subsonically throughout the
fabric of the cave, and wondered whether at an even deeper level there
might be a subterranean river.  This was a reasonable assumption, but he
could hardly have guessed the truth.  Switching on his camera, he began
to explore. <P>Garron was relieved to note that the air was breathable, although he
thought he could detect a faint tang of ammonia, which might suggest the
presence of bat-droppings.  Occasional scuttlings from the direction of
the pool confirmed that the cave system had developed its own ecology,
which he had no wish to disturb.  However, he did find signs of previous
disturbance; earlier probably by several thousand years, according to
archaeological colleagues with whom he later shared his sequence of
images.  They also concluded that there must once have been a far more
accessible entrance closer to the level of the cave floor, long since
sealed by a rock-fall.  Exact dating of the items would have to wait for
proper sampling and analysis by a fully trained team, but the success of
this preliminary survey meant that at least funding for future
expeditions should not be a problem.  <P>The skeletal fragments were undoubtedly human and almost certainly
Neolithic, judging from the artefacts visible in the same sediment:
ceramic shards, beads of shell and polished marble, even flakes of
high-value obsidian, which his colleagues believed originated in Melos.
A sheltered niche near the pool contained a blackened area with remnants
of animal bones, possibly of jackal, wolf or lynx. <P>Although he came to be credited with the rediscovery of the Myksos
cavern, Garron remained disappointed that in terms of Sibylline research
he had returned empty-handed.  Later expeditions, though valuable to
specialists in other fields of pre-history, found nothing remotely
oracular, at least, not for several millennia.  This was not surprising,
for the device conceived by long-term planners, and situated far below
the site of any excavation in Garron&#146;s era, was not intended to be
discovered until a much later phase of human development.  It was
designed to continue functioning for an extremely long time, and was
equipped to re-locate automatically if in danger of premature detection.
This escape function had been programmed as an afterthought, when the
craft in which the Installers had arrived was accidentally seen hovering
near the foot of the hill by a startled woman collecting medicinal
herbs.  Her mind had been implanted with the necessary warning.  She
would spread the word in her own tongue. <P><p class="drop">There is a faint unremarkable star, smaller than our sun.  It is called
Gliese 710, and is almost 64 light-years distant.  In astronomical terms
it is a 9<SUP>th</SUP> magnitude main sequence suspected variable star,
detected not many years ago in the constellation Ophiuchus.  In relation
to its distance its proper motion is unusually small.  That means it&#146;s
heading our way. <P>It has taken more than four billion years to achieve the solar system&#146;s
current equilibrium.  Gliese 710 is set to stir things up.  At its
closest approach it will pass within one light-year, generating swarms
of comets beyond the experience of humankind.  These showers will stream
sunwards, disintegrating as they sweep close to planets, becoming
meteors.  There will be impact events. <P>Deep in the Myksos cave a steady subsonic pulse confirms that the
predictive device continues to update information from that distant
stellar source, calculating gravitational fluctuations, refining its
vast store of accumulated data until the exact moment when those cold
stones become incandescent as they fall to earth.   <P>We have only 1,360,000 years until this occurs.  Soon we should start to
think about preparing to leave.  It would, after all, be wise. <P>
