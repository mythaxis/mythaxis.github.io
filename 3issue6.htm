<div><i>Some secrets ought not to be shared.</i>
<p class=drop>Despite himself, Leon was a little intimidated by the streamlined, palatial 
offices of Driffield Brown Pharmaceuticals. Having been approved by the 
formidable security front desk and escorted through an atrium like the main 
glasshouse at Kew Gardens and whisked up some hundreds of metres in a 
transparent elevator, shepherded by a supermodel with no conversation, he now  
found himself in a large space, two walls of which were of tinted glass, 
commanding impressive views of London and the Thames. The floor was covered with 
a thick brown velvety carpet in which the dents of his own footprints were 
clearly visible. He was perched on a black plastic and chrome chair of such 
modernity that it was barely recognisable as furniture. The chair was placed 
opposite a desk composed of a single irregular rectangle of black granite 
balanced on trestles of chrome-plated tubular steel. Behind the desk, in a 
monstrous big brother of Leon's chair, Professor Hiram Ochre, a very important 
man at Driffield Brown Pharmaceuticals, squatted like a bulbous toad. Leon had 
only met Ochre once, when his research grant was initially awarded. <P>Ochre's desk was completely clear except for a black cellphone as slender as a 
credit card, almost invisible against the granite, and one of these fancy 
devices that projected a holographic keyboard and screen on the desk surface. 
Professor Ochre touched one of the phantom keys on his desk, and a disembodied 
female voice trilled, "This conversation is being recorded." <P>"Dr Hartmann, thank you for coming to see us today," said Professor Ochre, 
without any actual appearance of gratitude.  <P>"It's a pleasure," lied Leon, whose mind buzzed with serious concern about the 
status of his Driffield Brown grant. <P>"I expect you are wondering why we called you in today. I am aware that you have 
been sending us quarterly reports on your project, and I am told that your work 
is satisfactory, if a little long-term." <P>Leon cleared his throat to remind the professor that a five-year clinical trial 
of a new drug was <I>necessarily</I> long-term, but Ochre silenced him with a 
gesture of his pale hand. <P>"I should like you to cease work on the er... work you are doing. We are not 
cancelling your research. It will be continued at a later date." <P>Leon felt he had to speak now. He needed the money the grant represented to pay 
his rent, grocery bills and other expenses. "But surely..." he began. <P>Ochre again gestured for silence and touched a corner of his keyboard. "This 
conversation is now off the record," trilled the voice of the recorder, 
"Information communicated now is secure, non-disclosable and deniable." <P><div class=pullquote>sick persons all over the world will 
be healed</div>
"Dr Hartmann," said Ochre, "I am authorised to tell you that we already know 
that the drug you are testing not only does not work very well but has a number 
of embarrassing side-effects. You are conducting this trial in order to play for 
time while we develop something better, so the longer it takes for the results 
to come out, the better it is for all concerned, except, perhaps, the patients 
on the trial." Ochre then read a form of words from his holographic screen, "You 
may not disclose this information but you may use it to assist your decision-
making process now and in the future." <P>Leon was lost for words, choking with surprise, or shock, but before he could 
express himself, Ochre had re-activated the recorder. "This conversation is 
being recorded". <P>Ochre continued: "You are acquainted with Doctor Jennifer Warriston." It was not 
a question, but Leon managed to nod. "You were, in fact, ah, romantically 
involved with 
Doctor Jennifer Warriston." <P>"We were, yes." <P>"Now, this is important. Do you still harbour friendly thoughts towards her?" <P>"Yes, I do, but..." <P>"But you fear that these friendly thoughts are not reciprocated. We thought so. 
However, if you could help her, you would." <P>"Yes, indeed." Leon's brain was in orbit by now. What <I>was</I> this?  <P>"And if by helping Dr Warriston you could help Driffield Brown and help 
yourself..." <P>Ochre's hesitation gave Leon the opportunity to ask, "Can you just tell me 
what's going on?" <P>"In short", replied Ochre, "We would like you to recruit Dr Warriston. We will 
reward you well for even making the attempt, with a bonus if you succeed." <P>Leon weighed three facts in his mind before replying. Fact one: Jennifer 
Warriston would never work for a pharmaceutical giant - Jenny's walk-out on him 
was provoked primarily by Leon's surrender to a business she considered 
criminally immoral. Fact two: Leon would very much like to be rewarded. Fact 
three: he would like to see Jenny again. By accepting Ochre's offer, which was, 
in any event, probably one of these offers you cannot refuse, he could do 
himself some good and Jenny no harm. "I'll certainly do my best, Professor." <P>Ochre continued: "I am aware of the resistance Dr Warriston may feel. She is a 
principled person running her own production facility in a remote part of 
Africa, providing inexpensive pharmaceuticals for underprivileged third world 
people. We have approached her officially and been rebuffed. She would not even 
discuss the package we offered her, a package that guaranteed to maintain and 
increase her philanthropic output, while making her medicines available to all 
our customers and, incidentally, allowing her virtually unlimited funds and 
research facilities. As it is, we now sell our own drugs into these markets at a 
trifle above cost price. She's going to go out of business." <P>"What can I offer her that's better than the offer you have already made?" <P>"We believe that she distrusts us, and has not even considered our terms. You 
are to be the honest broker. We will give you the contract. You will then carry 
it to her. She will be unlikely to refuse to look at it if <strong>you</strong> 
lay it at her feet. You will find out what she really wants; we will make the 
requested changes to the contract; you will have it checked by a lawyer of your 
choice. She may perhaps accept our terms; sick persons all over the world will 
be healed; Dr Warriston will be rich, fulfilled, and grateful to you; you will 
be, at least, rich, perhaps also fulfilled, and happy; Driffield Brown will be 
more profitable." <P>At the time, Leon found these aspirations rather appealing. "O.K. I'll try," he 
said. <P>
<p class=drop>Tripoli was founded by the Phoenicians, who called it Oea, at about the time 
when Homer was having his nappies changed. It was then civilized, century by 
century, by Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Turks, Italians, not necessarily in 
that order, and, eventually, by the Libyans themselves. Much of the city's 
architectural history still lurked behind the modern concrete and glass. One 
such remnant was Caf&eacute; Hassan, more of an expatriate club than the teashop 
it purported to be. Its battered frontage, eroded by time, traffic and bullets, 
carried no sign. Leon only knew he'd made it to the meeting point because his g-
phone, having guided him through a warren of alleys, told him so. The walk from 
his hotel had nevertheless been rather alarming. He was assailed in the broad 
modern streets by noisy fast traffic, most of which was propelled by big brutish 
internal combustion engines - unheard of in the oil-starved West. The few 
solarcars, with their 30kph top speed were treated like ox carts. Once in the 
souk, he had been constantly importuned by sellers of carpets, brasswork, 
oriental pleasures and hashish, so that he was baked and shredded by the time he 
stood in the doorway, nineteen minutes late. <P>As Leon entered the establishment, eyes glanced briefly at him and turned away. 
Only one pair of eyes met his and stayed. Leon threaded his way to a tiny table 
of wrought metal and plastic at which a thin woman was seated. Her physique and 
manner were young, but, up close, Leon realised that she must be in her fifties, 
lean and sinewy, with a lined, tanned face, grey eyes, and dressed in clean 
khaki shirt and trousers. He tried not to show surprise, but she grinned and 
said: "Hi, I'm Rae. Don't tell me. You expected your pilot to be a man."  <P>"I guess so. I'm Leon, Rae. I didn't have any expectation at all. I was more 
puzzled about the route I'm having to take to Chad." <P>"Well, as you probably already know, it's impossible for a foreigner to enter 
the country without a lot of hassle and a huge chain of bribes. If you slip up 
anywhere you could land in jail or in a ditch. It's actually quicker, cheaper 
and safer to enter illegally." <P>"How close can you get to where I'm going?" <P>"There's an airstrip and there's some route from there to the hospital. I'm 
taking supplies in quite regularly, but I've never seen the medical facility. 
You a medic, then?" <P>"Kind of. But it's news to me that it's a hospital. The doctor I'm visiting is a 
pharmaceutical expert. I thought she was manufacturing drugs." <P>"Oh, yeah, I heard that, too, but they've definitely got patients. A couple of 
Chinese medics went in a few weeks ago. Some of my passengers are mercenaries 
for the so-called freedom fighters. Not many of them make the return journey. 
White man's grave. Worse now, because of the war. But there's a steady trickle 
of patients for the hospital. There's a rumour they can cure AIDS there. The 
patients I ferry in and out are rich and sick. I think they're what's funding 
the hospital, and this trip you're making is not cheap, 'cos it ain't legal. 
Anyway, you've brought everything?" <P>"Yes." <P>"The money?"  <P>The money. No-one used money much these days. In London, Paris and New York, the 
only thing you could buy with actual banknotes were illegal narcotics and 
services from various freelance enterprises - chiefly bookmakers, prostitutes, 
plumbers and electricians. <P>The wad of US dollars that Leon handed over would have paid for a 
round-the-world cruise in a luxury cabin on the QE4. Leon had wondered how Driffield Brown 
explained the cash to their accountants. <P>"I take it, even though this is strictly illegal, you don't anticipate any 
trouble?" Something about handing over this much cash made Leon a little 
nervous. <P>"We don't show up much on radar, and we don't look like a military threat. When 
I first started these trips, they scrambled a couple of Russian helicopter 
gunships to look me over. They don't bother any more. Don't worry." <P>"OK. I won't." <P>"Anyway, this is a two day trip. I'm taking you as far south as I can today. 
Then, if the weather's OK, we'll get where you're going tomorrow." <P>"Understood." <P>"Let's go, then," said Rae, leading the way out to a battered Toyota Ecojeep 
which was soaking up some solars in a nearby dusty square. "Don't know why I 
bother with this sun-bucket," she apologised, as they entered the maelstrom that 
was Tripoli traffic, "Gasoline is only ten dollars a gallon here."  It was eight 
euros a litre in London, more than fifty dollars a gallon, and it was rationed. <P><p class=drop>Twenty minutes and ten near-death experiences later, they arrived at what 
appeared to be a private airfield. If Leon expected anything of Rae's aircraft, 
it would have been like something out of a 20th century thriller movie - a small 
monoplane with a single gasoline engine. The craft Rae drove him to wasn't 
remotely like that. It was dominated by its slender wing, thirty or forty metres 
in span, matt black on top, light grey below. The fuselage and tail assembly 
were hung on below the wing like an afterthought, as were a quartet of what 
looked like jet turbines. It stood on a seemingly random set of skinny 
undercarriages which supported the long wings and stubby body at various points.  <P>"Wow, Rae, what's this?" <P>"Another surprise, Leon? Meet <I>Nostromo</I>." <P>"Nostromo? Wasn't that the spaceship in <I>Alien</I>?" <P>"Yup. She's made of the lightweight stuff they make tennis racquets out of. The 
wings are photo-voltaic collectors, it's got these new lightweight batteries and 
it's entirely electronically controlled. More of a powered glider, really. Solar 
powered. A dream to fly." <P>"So these aren't jet engines under the wings?" <P>"No. Electric fans. They give propulsion when needed and generate electricity on 
the overrun." <P>"Wow. It looks as if it would blow away in a brisk breeze. I can see it shifting 
as I stand here." <P>"Watch the tail." <P>"Oh, I see. It's trimming itself all the time to face the wind." <P>"That's right. It needs lots of room so it can turn itself around. Up to a sixty 
knot wind, it automatically adjusts its orientation and control surfaces to stay 
lift neutral. The harder it blows, the harder it stays down. Above sixty knots, 
it's safer airborne. The makers recommend you get a line on it and let it fly 
like a kite. But I've never tried that because you'd need much more flat ground 
than I've usually got. High winds like that only happen a couple of times a year 
around here, and if Meteorology says there's a storm on the way, I just fly out 
and dodge it. The harder it blows, the higher I fly." <P>"It looks expensive." <P>"It was, but the running costs are negligible. You ready?" <P><div class=pullquote>The heroes of the revolution down below 
like to take potshots at any aircraft they see</div>
Leon watched as Rae organised an operator with an ancient Land Rover to tow 
Nostromo to the start of the runway. The Land Rover drove a few hundred yards 
down the tarmac, paying out a long nylon rope. Leon climbed aboard into a seat 
behind the pilot, surrounded by crates of plastic containers, while Rae 
connected the end of the rope somewhere up front. She then climbed in, pressed a 
button to start the fans, and waved to the driver of the Land Rover. In seconds, 
they were bowling along steadily, the aircraft already alive and eager to fly, 
towed by the Land Rover. Rae operated something up front, and they leapt into 
the air quite suddenly. She pulled a lever, and they were free, still climbing 
under the power of the fans. Rae was working hard, pulling and locking various 
levers. <P>"Getting up the undercarriage," she explained over her shoulder, "Saves 
electricity if I do it by hand." <P>"Do you always need a tug to get airborne?" asked Leon. <P>"No. Same answer. The fan'll get us up, but a tow saves juice. Give me a minute 
or two. I'll just find us a nice thermal for altitude."  <P>From several thousand feet, Leon could see the startling effects of the Libyan 
desert irrigation project. Sea water distilled to fresh. Huge rectangles of 
arable land were appearing in the desert. <P>The only sounds in the aircraft were the wind and the intermittent hum of the 
fan. The ride was amazingly smooth. Rae talked endlessly about the wonders of 
Nostromo. Theoretically, she could stay airborne indefinitely, like an 
albatross, drawing on the energy of the wind and sun, though, of course, there 
were food, drink and other matters to consider.  <P>Progress was irregular. Sometimes they paused and circled in an updraught to 
gain height; sometimes they flew steadily with the electric fans humming; often, 
they cruised in straight and slightly downward flight like a sailplane. Some six 
hours after take-off, they landed at what appeared to be a former oil company 
airstrip, attended by an Italian-speaking caretaker who seemed to have been 
expecting them. <P>They ate pasta prepared by the caretaker, drank water, and bedded down for the 
night in a corrugated iron hut. They took off in the early dawn next day, an 
almost vertical ascent into a stiff breeze. A few hours into the flight, Leon 
started to see the signs of stunted bushes and trees, which thickened as the day 
progressed. The vast Lake Chad (less vast than it was in yesteryear) stretched 
to the southern horizon. <P>Eventually, Rae pointed out a set of military huts below. "There's your 
hospital. I'm turning west for the airstrip." <P>The setting sun blazed into the cockpit, and Leon heard bursts of crackling over 
the wind rush.  <P>"What's that?" he asked. <P>The airstrip was visible now. Tiny figures in a jeep below were gesticulating. 
They were only 30 metres above the raw desert. Rae was busy deploying the 
undercarriage as she spoke: "Gunfire. The heroes of the revolution down below 
like to take potshots at any aircraft they see in case it's a government attack. 
They use SAM missiles from time to time, but I don't generate enough heat or 
radar signal for them to get a target lock. They seldom hit anything with small 
arms fire."  <P>A loud ping and rattle somewhere up front gave the lie to this statement, but 
nothing more happened before they were dropping onto the start of a rough runway 
of crushed red gravel. There was another aircraft drawn up to the side, a couple 
of army trucks decorated with red crosses on white circles and a few men in 
khaki. <P>"Hello, what's this?" said Rae, "I don't usually have any company here." <P>"Looks military medical," said Leon. <P>"It certainly does. If you don't want to stay, I'll take off right away." <P>While it looked a little iffy, Leon wasn't keen to abandon his mission at this 
stage. "They don't look particularly hostile. I'll see if they'll give me a lift 
to the hospital." <P>Rae taxied to an open space, and they climbed stiffly to the ground. 
Surprisingly, most of the soldiers paid no attention to them as they approached. 
One, however, came towards them with a smile.  <P>"Leon, I think they're Chinese," said Rae. "That's one of the medics I flew in 
last month, but he wasn't in uniform then." <P>The medic concerned spoke good English, greeted them politely and was apparently 
delighted to ferry Leon to the hospital. But he pointed out that Dr Warriston 
was not there.  <P>"Do you know where she is?" asked Leon. <P>"Yes, I do." <P>"And..." <P>"She is here, of course. I will take you to her." <P>Jenny, perspiring in the loading bay of the aircraft, was surprised, but not 
pleased, to see Leon. She broke off from whatever she was doing, and jumped 
down. <P>"What in God's name are you doing here, Leon?" were her exact words, uttered in 
a voice that discouraged reply. <P>"Hi, Jenny. This is Rae, who brought me here." <P>"Hello, Rae, we've never met, but I'm aware of your shuttle service. I suppose, 
Leon, that these clowns at Driffield Brown are still trying to recruit me, and 
that you are their latest desperate attempt. Professor Ochre, yes?" <P>"Yes." <P>"He's had my answer by phone, letter and e-mail." <P>"I told them they were wasting their time, but I thought 'Why not come and see 
you, anyway?'" <P>"It's not a good moment." <P>"I imagine not. What's going on?" <P>"Well, maybe it <I>is</I> a good moment. I'm closing down here and setting up a 
new facility in China." She paused, and eyed Leon carefully. "Got your 
passport?" <P>"Of course." <P>"Well, give us a hand here, and you can come along. I've been told I can bring 
anyone I like. I'm sure Professor Ochre would approve of your persistence. You 
can decide later whether to ditch Driffield Brown and join the good guys." <P>Leon stared. <P>"C'mon. It's either this or back to the Professor. I think the People's Republic 
is much less risky." <P><p class=drop>Half an hour later, they waved to Rae, who was repairing a bullet hole in 
Nostromo with a sort of puncture repair kit, and boarded the plane chartered by 
the Chinese, an elderly, not to say ancient, Canadian de Haviland Dash 7, 
painted in camouflage colours, with Red Cross symbols and hard-to-read 
identification insignia. On board, in addition to the French pilot, Jenny and 
Leon, were the two Chinese medics and four Africans in medical stretchers, who 
nevertheless looked pretty healthy to Leon. Every inch of cargo space was 
occupied by cardboard crates. <P>It was pitch dark outside as they took off along a faint flare path of 
flickering LEDs. In the spartan cabin, Leon looked at Jenny and raised an 
eyebrow. He felt a thrilling <I>frisson</I> at being with her again. <P>"What?" she asked. <P>"It's nice to see you, too." He said it sarcastically, but he smiled to take the 
sting out. <P>Jenny's mouth firmed into a straight line. Then she said, "It's a bit of a 
surprise." <P>"But a pleasant one?" <P>I'll get back to you on that. I'm very busy right now, as you may have noticed."  <P>"Can you bear to fill me in?" <P>"We fly to Sudan, transfer to a Chinese military transport, and continue to 
Tientsin in Northern China. There's a new facility out in the sticks just 
waiting for us to arrive, and I won't be starved for resources." <P>"What happened to 'cheap medicines for third world countries'?" <P>"You know what happened. I wasn't the only pirate operation in the world. Every 
philanthropist with a degree in pharma started a cottage industry, and now all 
the big companies are doing what we asked them to do years ago, and selling 
their mature products at a price a small setup couldn't match." <P>Leon began to feel uncomfortable at this hard-faced Jenny, "So you're out of business." <P>"In that respect, yes. But what I've got now is something very much better." <P>"And that is?" <P>"A breakthrough in HIV treatment." <P>"But the entire board of Driffield Brown would crawl over broken glass for 
that." <P>"Not for my cure." <P>"Why not?" <P>"You're getting into too much detail. I don't want to discuss it." <P>"You've got a new treatment for HIV, and you don't want to discuss it?" <P>"Not with you. Not with anyone." <P>"Except your Chinese friends." <P>"Right." <P>"So you can corner the market? Like one of the pharma companies you always 
hated?" <P>"No. Look. I'm going to make it available. I'm going to China so that the big 
drugs companies can't suppress it with legal injunctions, negative propaganda 
and commercial blackmail." <P>"So what is it?" <P>"Are you sure you want to know? Knowing will commit you. I may have to kill 
you." <P>"Oh, Jenny, you can trust me." <P>"Can I?" <P>"Absolutely. Let's have it." Leon was sure of this. Part of it was to get closer 
to Jenny, he realised that, but being associated with an important discovery was 
a huge potential bonus. <P>"OK," said Jenny, "I'll go back to the beginning. I started out by building a 
production line for nuceloside analogues - HIV inhibitors - like AZT et cetera. 
I knew how to do that." <P>"Sure. That was the way to go." <P>"And a protease inhibitor for combination HIV therapy, also freely adapted from 
a commercial product." <P>"Obviously," said Leon, "You'd need that too." <P>"You realise why I had to do this in a third world country." <P>"Of course. If you set up a production line in South London, you'd be locked up 
for patent infringement in a fortnight. I'm just sorry I didn't feel rebellious 
enough to come with you." <P>"But here's the thing, Leon. I needed a whole raft of HIV sufferers to test on. 
I mean, the chemicals were OK. They analysed indistinguishable from the pukka 
product. I just wanted to build a little confidence. This was Africa. There 
would be no shortage of HIV positives, I thought. But there <b><i>was</i></b> a 
shortage. In the precise area of Chad where I'd set up shop, where HIV and AIDS 
were a big problem a few years ago, I could only find a handful of subjects - 
less than fifty. It turned out, and this is where it starts to sound weird, a 
local village doctor had a cure." <P>Leon smirked. How often had there been rumours like this? "Oh, c'mon, Jenny." <P>"I know. But listen. Among my test subjects, there was a pair of sisters that 
I'd been treating. I had good records on them over several months. Both were HIV 
positive. In the middle of my drug trial, their relatives saved up enough money 
to send them to the doctor. We're not talking big bucks here. A breeding pair of 
goats in Chad will cost a peasant a year's income. The sisters were cured. Both 
of them. The HIV had gone. No trace. Well, I say 'no trace'..." <P>"Aaah." <P>"The 'cure', you see, is actually another disease. It's been known for some time 
that one virus can interact with another and produce a different virus by a 
process of reallocation of viral RNAs. It appears that two different HIV strains 
have combined to create a new virus which doesn't cause immunity problems in 
humans, and which out-competes the strains of HIV that do cause trouble. It's 
also been known for some time that occasional patients turn up, who appear to be 
immune to HIV. You know about the Kenyan prostitutes?" <P>"Didn't they turn out not to be immune after all?" <P>"Well, those that ceased to have regular contact with HIV eventually lost the 
immunity, that's true. But it appeared that continuous exposure maintained the 
resistance. My theory is that this new disease resembles HIV sufficiently 
closely to give the body immunity." <P>"So where did this witch doctor get the treatment from?" <P>"He's not a witch doctor. He's more of a herbalist and vet. Don't ask me how he 
stumbled on it, but it appears that one of his tricks was to draw blood from one 
person and inject it into another. I think he had a sort of vague idea of 
vaccination. He'd been doing it for years.  You may know that Chinese alchemists 
administered smallpox inoculation a thousand years ago, so it was a known 
technique before it was discovered in the West." <P>"Yes, I heard that." <P>"Well, at some point, he must have mixed up strains of HIV and produced this new 
one in a patient, then transmitted it along not knowing what he was doing. His 
patients also spread it by sexual contact, and in a remarkably short time, he 
had a healthy population of HIV-resistant patients and their friends and 
relatives. It's a small world in an African village. I did a lot of checking, 
and a little experimentation, but it worked. It really works. All that's 
required is to spread the disease. I'm having the impudence to call it Warriston's 
Disease." <P>"So why don't you tell everybody?" <P>"It has a side-effect." <P>"Which is?" <P>"Leon, there's a plague in this world. It's a plague that's destroying quality 
of life for millions, killing the planet, threatening even the continuation of 
the human race." <P>"AIDS is hardly <b><I>that</I></b> bad." <P>"I'm not talking about AIDS, Leon. I'm talking about over-population." <P>"So you're going to withhold your cure and let everyone die of AIDS?" <P>"No. I'm going to let the side-effect run amok." <P>"What's the side effect?" <P>"Sterility." <P>Leon was silent for a moment or two. "But that means that people have to choose 
immunity or children." <P>"Not if they don't know." <P>"But it'll leak out." <P>"Eventually. It'll be noticed. Meanwhile, the Chinese and Indians are very 
interested because both have exploding populations and a largely hidden HIV 
problem. For many in the West, immunity from AIDS and a lifelong contraceptive 
would be a bonus, by the way." <P>"And meanwhile?" <P>"Meanwhile, I'm starting with four donors - you saw them being loaded - and a 
plan to create thousands more in a project in China. A test tube of blood from a 
donor will treat twenty or thirty patients, but we still have to build a 
production facility like an inverted pyramid. A donor can give a pint of blood 
every couple of weeks, but will take thousands of donors to manufacture doses in 
sufficient quantity to be effective. It will be a while before it becomes widely 
available. Certainly, it could be years before the problem became well known. 
And even then anyone with HIV would probably be glad to make the sacrifice of 
sterility in return for a permanent cure, don't you think?" <P>Leon was horrified. "I don't believe you are doing this. A bit of philanthropic 
patent busting is one thing, but knowingly spreading a sterility virus in secret 
is something else altogether!" <P>"I thought it might be a mistake to tell you. You were always a sanctimonious 
little prick, Leon." <P>"You've changed." <P>"No, I haven't. I've still got the good of the planet at heart." Jenny was silent
for a few moments. "Look, I need to know if you're with me." <P>"You can't expect me to go along with this!" <P>"I'm sorry to hear that, Leon. It's pretty lonely out here.
Anyway, I have 
to keep the lid on it for the time being. So... I'm afraid you are going to be 
another donor for a while. I can't let you go now, Leon. I'm sorry. Perhaps we can work 
together when you get used to the idea." <P>Leon tried to stand up, but the Chinese medics grabbed him and strapped him down 
to a spare stretcher.  <P>"You'll never get away with it!" he yelled. <P>"Oh, God. That line comes from a James Bond movie, Leon. I already 
<b><i>have</i></b> got away with it. My teams of donors are already spreading 
across Africa, keen to mingle their body fluids with willing patients, spreading 
good health and birth control throughout the continent. Your little friend Rae 
has ferried quite a few gratefully diseased well-off people to Tripoli, most of 
whom will energetically introduce the virus into Europe and America." <P>Leon resorted to insults and entreaties.  The plane droned on and Jenny caught a 
little sleep. Her lack of response made Leon even more desperate.  <P>Shortly thereafter, one of the Chinese medics anaesthetized Leon to keep him 
quiet.
