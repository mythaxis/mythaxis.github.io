<div><i>The author tells me his inspiration comes from newspaper articles.
I suggest he subscribes to a less sensational periodical.</i>
<p class="drop">The rivets on a side panel popped out
and the panel disappeared. The
vastness of space sucked it up and took it away. Someday it would fall into
a black hole. More rivets popped. Another panel, gone. The ship was falling
apart fast. I applied power to the pair of thrusters on both sides of the
ship to see if they could physically push the walls together. To keep the
ship from falling into a million pieces. Little did it help. I watched in
horror as more panels disappeared.
</p>
<p>
We had entered an asteroid field on our way across the Algol System, also
known as home of the Demon Star. Dimity watched me maneuver the ship,
looking over my shoulder, commenting on possible moves, giving me faulty
advice, leading me into possibilities that would have landed us hard
against any one of half a dozen planets, if I'd listened to him. The team
of scientists who had employed us, buckled down in the back, didn't dare
ask what was going on. I dodged another asteroid and watched another panel
disappear off the ship.
</p>
<p>
The triple suns created havoc with our gravitational prediction models. I
could think of only one way to keep a ship like this from falling apart
under these conditions. I forced the bow upward, past the equatorial line
the planets followed, bringing us closer to what some would call north,
above the polar regions of the revolving members of the Algol System. The
asteroids thinned out. I saw a pattern in the field and punched a way
through. Because I was that kind of pilot. I was something else. Dimity
could thank me later. The scientists could thank me later. They could all
thank me later, but I had a feeling they wouldn't. This trip was about
money.
</p>
<p>
I'd just met Dimity for the first time, before embarking. A team of
scientists funded by a grey market corporation had needed a ride. Grey
companies like this one operated in that region between legal and illegal,
more often referred to as extra-legal by the courts. Little did guys
like Dimity care about the courts. They could all go screw themselves, as
far as he was concerned. That's why the researcher team had hired us. He
had the ship and I had the skills to navigate through difficult places like
the Algol System, with an uncharted asteroid field.
</p>
<p>
When we arrived unscratched, aside from the damage to the ship, and
physically looking a decade older than when we'd left, Dimity wanted me to
pay for the fuel. I couldn't get it through his thick Cobwebian head
that I had been hired to pilot the ship. Without me, he wouldn't have made
a single peso. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The idea of an equal
partnership between us was too big a concept for him to grasp. That we were
working together never took hold. Expenses should have been paid for by the
corporation funding the research. I said no to Dimity and he'd never
stopped demanding the money from me. You'd think the past faded, but with
Dimity, it didn't. He couldn't stop thinking about it. That was over ten
years ago.
<p>
<p class=drop>Dimity, Kathra and I sat on a bench at the bus stop.
Behind us, graffiti
and alien signatures. The city, covered in smog. My eyes burned. Hover
buses came and went and still we sat. Dimity pointed his finger in my face,
the same old song and dance, but I tuned out his banter. I had more to
worry about than him. I'd suffered from reoccurring bouts of blood
poisoning since my youth. It had something to do with missing organs in my
body and synthetic replacements made from cheap parts. But Dimity kept
going on about the accumulating debt I owed him. He pointed out the
compounding problem of late payments. When I shook my head no, he said he
wanted my false teeth. It had finally come down to that. I didn't have much
else to offer, and he knew it.
</p>
<p>
I couldn't stop worrying about having blood poisoning. I could sense it
coming on, every time. The false teeth between my jaws couldn't absorb the
poison, but it would have been a good laugh if Dimity had managed to get
them out of me and had sold them to some clueless soul. He wouldn't stop
going on and on about yanking them from my jaws, right on the spot, in
exchange for all that he claimed I owed.
</p>
<p>
Kathra sat on the other end of the bench, on the other side of me. She
wanted to leave in a hurry. And while she moaned on and on about it,
another hover bus came and went, and still we sat there, our interpersonal
issues unresolved. She tugged on my elbow, mentioning the Kelgon salts we
could harvest out on the moons of Arapaho, and how the price had gone up
over a fortnight. She had been yammering about going into business together
for several weeks now, telling me to keep my eye open for prospects. While
I pretended not to listen, she extrapolated market dynamics with her
fingers in the air, and gibbered whatnot, making claims I couldn't even
understand. Now that the depression had turned worse than projected, we'd
better act fast, she said.
</p>
<p>
When you don't have many friends, you can't afford to be picky. That's how
I'd ended up here, on a bench with two self-obsessed borderline
participants in the human race. I had her on one side spouting her strange
ideas on how we could make a fortune in market returns and Dimity on the
other side yammering about the debt I owed him
and the trending value of
my false teeth. The smog shifted and put a clamp on my mood. I couldn't
tell if it might have been from the blood poisoning or just the annoyance
of trying to make sense out of things when talking to a couple of people
with heads full of shredded particle matter. Neither of them cared about my
health, I could see. Not at all. I could have dropped dead on the spot and
they'd probably have picked up and moved on without much concern. Who
needed
friends like that? Still, here I was.
</p>
<p>
Someone had to make a decision about what to do next and that someone
couldn't be either one of them. I stood up. Then I sat down. What a rush! I
stilled my mind and slowed my heart. Then I stood up again, this time with
reservations, but also with motivation enough to get to the clinic before I
passed out. The poison had found its way to the pathways running to my
brain. I saw spots in the air and they weren't just from debris floating in
the smog.
</p>
<p>
The clinic couldn't have been more than five intersections away. I counted
the road crossings on my fingers as we walked through each one: thumb,
index finger, middle finger, stop light. Two more to go. A shaman had once
taught me to how meditate, to slow my heart, but I couldn't focus my mind
well, what with Dimity and Kathra distracting me on either side. I held my
hands up and tried to shush them, with little results.
</p>
<p>
Dimity barked, "Does this road take us to the bank? I'm expecting full
payment."
</p>
<p>
I ignored him. Instead, I counted things as I waited for the light to
change. I had this habit of counting things all the time. It helped to pass
the time. Seven white stripes in the crosswalk. Four windows in each hover
car. Two people standing next to me, neither one with an IQ worth
mentioning. Fourteen windows in the building across the street, all with
bars, five of them with broken glass.
</p>
<p>
"The Kelgon salts, the markets-" Kathra said, but I shook her by the
shoulders and she paused.
</p>
<p>
"We'll come back to that. Prices fluctuate. Money comes and goes. We'll
consider our options after I see a man."
</p>
<p>
"What man?"
</p>
<p>
"A doctor."
</p>
<p>
"What kind-?" She hesitated, nervous twitches exhibited by the muscle
spasms in her neck, realigning the tilt of her head.
</p>
<p>
"A clean doctor."
</p>
<p>
She backed up a step. She turned and did a visual once-over of Dimity. As
if the two had been on opposites sides of me all morning and neither had
been listening to the other talk. Dimity wanted money and she had a way to
get it. The only thing they needed just happened to be me, a pilot, the
kind who could navigate through a gravitational meat grinder and back
without much more than a scratch on his tail fin.
</p>
<p>
The traffic light changed. I shook them off and took a step forward,
leaving them behind to argue about the possibility of the price of Kelgon
dropping before they arrived there. And where would they get the mining
equipment? Salts mostly lay on the surface, left over by tides from eons
ago when the moons had oceans. They could be scooped up without much
trouble and shipped off to packing plants. All in all, that required
planning, time and money. And a pilot with a big enough ship.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes blood poisoning runs thick, stopping the heart. And sometimes
blood poisoning is just a way of describing how people think, the craziest
notions taking them to the fringe. In my case, I had the real thing. As far
as Kathra and Dimity went, they both were coming down with a bad case of
salt fever. Kelgon salts could be packed along the walls of the inner
chambers of Pentox engines, keeping the thrusters from getting too hot.
And, as everyone knew, without a Pentox, you might as well try and
hitchhike across the galaxy.
</p>
<p>
I'd almost made it half way through the intersection when they caught up
and grabbed me by the arms. We stood in the middle of the lane, hovering
vehicles preparing to accelerate once the light changed. Neither would let
go until I promised to navigate a way for them to the moons of Arapaho.
Dimity emphasized how he was going to rip my false teeth right out of my
head right here and right now if I didn't comply. Kathra, meanwhile,
couldn't stop reciting details about the inverse relationship between the
depression and the market value for Kelgon. I attempted to wave at the
people in the hover cars, hoping they would be so nice as to wait until I
got out of the way. A little boy with a stuffed toy in one hand waved back.
The numbers next to the traffic light counted down. We had less than a
minute to go.
</p>
<p>
I'd met Kathra when she'd looked beautiful. Somehow, time hadn't treated
her like a lady. She hadn't been more than a young flower when her parents
had begged me to take her with me. Her mother and father had been
struggling to keep a farm on a distant outpost from disappearing into the
sand. It had came down to the wars. And the depression. And the trouble
with the stellar storms. Entire star systems had swept their way through
gasses in space and been relieved of any sign of life. Her folks had made
me promise I'd keep her safe. I guess in a way I owed her something, by
now. Maybe I owed Dimity something, too. Maybe I had a soft side. I
suspected her parents might have been disappointed in the way I'd turned
out. Maybe I owed them something, too. If the poison hadn't been pulsing
through my veins at this moment, I'd have made a sincere effort to find out
what had become of them.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Kathra disappeared from time to time. I never asked her
where she went. She had turned legal by now and could make decisions for
herself. My pledge to be her guardian had grown thin. Just like Dimity's
demands for money.
</p>
<p>
"Listen, Dimity," I said.
</p>
<p>
"What?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm not giving you my false teeth and I'm not paying you for that ship."
</p>
<p>
"What? You have to."
</p>
<p>
"No. I don't. Get over it."
</p>
<p>
"I'm gonna break every bone in your head, if you don't."
</p>
<p>
"And what then? Then you'll never get nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Satisfaction. I'll get my satisfaction."
</p>
<p>
I put my hands together like I was praying. "Let's get out of this
intersection. After I see this doctor, I'll listen to your plans. But I'm
not paying for something that happened over a decade ago."
</p>
<p>
"Why not?"
</p>
<p>
"Because I'm not."
</p>
<p>
I shook free and made it to the next platform just as the light changed.
They landed next to me, not more than half a breath short of a visit to the
afterlife. A hover craft beeped a dissonant beep, passed us and sped on.
Dimity gestured at it, both fists punching the air.
<p>
<p class=drop>
After waiting in a long line, and finally getting seated in a white room, I
met a doctor who pressed some medication into my hand. I downed the cup and
he returned to scribbling on a chart with diagrams of my brain. From this
angle the page looked relatively vacant of information. He pushed his pen
deep into the paper as he filled in missing details. I fought to keep the
clock from slowing down. The medication should have done something right
away, but nothing happened. I waited. He scribbled. I yawned. He glanced up
at me and returned to his word puzzle. I felt a wave of nausea pass below
my ribs and rammed my head into his garbage can.
</p>
<p>
The inside of the garbage can reminded me of simulations I'd seen of
passing through theoretical hyperspace. It was curved and reflective and
what you saw in the depths resembled a mirrored version of yourself
throwing up. When I pulled my head out and sat back down, I noticed my
forehead swelling. The pressure on my skull pinched my nose and expanded
outward. I tried not to act like anything had changed, but as my forehead
grew in size, I had trouble seeing the doctor. A gigantic slab of flesh
dropped down over my nose and I squinted, leaning back in my chair to see.
The doctor hardly noticed. Then he noticed.
</p>
<p>
"Stop it. Sit up," he said. "We've got complaints from seven doctors, all
saying you requested a visit with the same symptoms, a case of blood
poisoning. You've got nothing wrong with you at all. I'd say you just need
some rest."
</p>
<p>
I sat up and the pain in my forehead disappeared. "What?"
</p>
<p>
"The pills I gave you were a placebo."
</p>
<p>
"Wait a minute. What am I paying you for, then?"
</p>
<p>
"Professional advice. Get over whatever it is that makes you think you're
being poisoned. See a doctor, if you have to. I mean the other kind
of doctor,
not like me. One for the inside of your head."
</p>
<p>
He had his pen in the air like he wanted to stab me. I got up and walked
out without paying. Kathra and Dimity were waiting in the hall, talking. I
mean, they were standing close together, and talking. I saw something then,
something of a spark between them, and a future with no bounds. I'd never
thought anything like that could be possible between a pair like those two.
She had the goods and he wanted to get his hands full. Why had I never
noticed before how attractive she still looked?
</p>
<p>
"Let's go eat," I said.
</p>
<p>
"You're paying," Dimity said and spit at the floor.
</p>
<p>
Kathra wrapped her arm around his and together we left in search of meat.
</p>
<p>
Throughout dinner, they kept at it, eyes locked on to each other, and
talking about this plan of theirs. They'd share the wealth. A full
partnership. As if Dimity had never thought of the concept of a partnership
before. I was sure it had all been Kathra's idea. And where did I fit in,
in all this? Making payments for my debt, apparently. Dimity still wanted
my false teeth.
</p>
<p>
The lights dimmed, the atmosphere turned heavy, the room reeked of animals
on fire, and I took another bite. The pressured eased off my temples. Beef
eateries of this low class were rare, full of bad reputations at every
table, just the way I liked it. This one was a favorite of mine, serving
the best slab of meat this side of the interstellar farm. I tuned out the
conversation between Dimity and Kathra and drank more wine, letting my head
fall back and my brain spin. I made the mistake of clicking my false teeth.
Dimity noticed.
</p>
<p>
A phone in my shirt pocket beeped and I flipped it open. Port security had
something to say about a ship bursting into flames. A ship I had been
responsible for. I'd been hired to keep the ship in prime condition, ready
to go as soon as anyone wanted a ride out of here. If the report of a fire
held any truth, my skin would burn for it.
</p>
<p>
I climbed out of the door first, Dimity and Kathra no more than two
steps
behind me. When we got there, all that remained in the parking spot was the
hull of a vessel covered in tar and flame-retarding foam. I asked who had
moved my ship and security explained that the disfigured mess of burned
wires in front of us was my ship. The ship I was responsible for. I wept. I
broke apart inside. My heart ripped open as I sat down on the floor. Then
they told me I had to clean it up. Get the hull out of the way. Refinish
the floors. Put a new seal on the hangar. It would cost a fortune. My
employer would send me the bill.
</p>
<p>
Dimity tugged on Kathra's elbow. He knew of a ship they could rent in the
next space hub, three clicks away. They could find another pilot. He said
he would come back later and extract my teeth, when they returned. I sat
with my head on my knees and let them go.
</p>
<p >
<p class=drop>I didn't see Dimity again for many years. Kathra went on
to make a fortune
in the Kelgon business. I should have listened to her. All the debt I had
accumulated in just this one pocket of space finally caught up to me. I had
to pay for the meal at the restaurant, not my bill, really not. And the
doctor. I didn't see why I owed him that much for a placebo, not that much
at all. That bill should have added up to less than the fin off a silver
dollar. The ship I was responsible for had to be craned out of the port,
and I had to pay for rubbish disposal and replacing the interior of the
hangar. Without a credit to my name, I was sentenced to ten years in the
soul mines. The place they sent me wasn't called the soul mines because you
dug for souls down there. It's where you went and lost your soul. Ten years
felt like a wasted lifetime. Most people never came back to the surface of
the planet again. It was pretty close to a bad carbon copy of hell.
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of time to think while down in the soul mines. I revisited my
childhood. My family had occupied a square of desert on an uncharted
planet. By now, my home world is on the maps, but it took a while to get
there. I'd never known my dad. My mother had been terrible with hygiene and
by my teenage years I'd lost most of my teeth, my gums rotted out, dental
care nowhere to be found. It hurt. It hurt a lot.
</p>
<p>
It hurt my pride more than anything as I'd never landed a girlfriend. By
graduation, I'd found a job, low to moderate income, and with my first
paycheck, I started making payments on a set of false teeth. Mother was
dead set against it. She said they'd give me an allergic reaction. My rage
boiled in response to her suggestion that none of this had been her fault.
The suffering in my jaw from the rotting of the roots of my teeth had
become unbearable. In agony, I traveled to the southern end of the planet
to meet a shaman who taught me how to meditate, how to tune out the pain
that oscillated in my mind. The shaman lived in a valley covered in snow.
In the afternoons, the sun would melt the ice, the water running off down
into the land of farmers below. At night, the snow would fall again,
covering the temple and the mountain peaks. I'd learned servitude from the
shaman and devotion to a deity that no one had ever depicted before.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, in the soul mines, the blood poisoning would come back to me.
Forget what the doctors had said. They didn't know what they were talking
about. It would hit the worst when my mind showed cracks in it. Some say
blood poisoning happens when toxins entered the body. Some say it is
brought on by a bitterness in the soul. In my case, it worked like a
disparity in my thoughts, anguish and desire fighting with each other on
the way to the pinnacle of my brain. I survived the heat and the pressure
and the intense pain of the soul mines by mediation. I slowed my heart,
cleared my head, lost all attachments to time and space, and paid my dues.
When my ten years came to a close, I breached the surface, dangling long
white hair and a twisted beard from my skull, my face filled with wrinkles,
my thoughts nearly gone. The cracks had grown wide down there.
</p>
<p>
I acquired a room in the blind district. It didn't matter that I could see,
as nobody there could see that I could. I came and went up and down the
streets like the faint reverberation of water dropping deep into a well.
The blind took me in as one of their own and shared scraps of food with me
when they floated down the gutter. The four walls of the room I resided in
had hand prints on them, soot-black, evenly spaced, at about the same
height as the door knob. I slept on a cot of magazines about a decade
thick. To pay for the room, I picked up a job adjusting the tension on the
wires strung between electrical towers. I learned to do it with my eyes
closed.
</p>
<p>
Coming home every Saturday night, we'd gather around the community table
and play cards. The blind play cards by touch. The queen of hearts feels
like velvety soft skin. The jack of hearts is limp, bent and wrinkled. The
king has edges sharp as a crown of thorns. I learned them all. I played
fast. I looked at the cards from time to time when I forgot which was
which. Nobody discovered my technique. Still, I hardly won. The blind can
be ruthless when it comes to a game of chance.
</p>
<p>
When Dimity sat down at the table to play, one day, deep into the winter of
my life, I pretended I couldn't see him there. I dealt the cards, skipping
his chair.
</p>
<p>
"Partner, I want in," he said and coughed.
</p>
<p>
"Stakes are high," I whispered, feeling the edge of the table and finding
the stack of cards and cutting them.
</p>
<p>
"No price is too high for me, partner."
</p>
<p>
"You sound eager to win."
</p>
<p>
"Eager for that set of false teeth in your head." He snorted mucus from his
nostrils, coughed, and spit on the floor. "Are you sure you don't know me?"
</p>
<p>
The blood poisoning ran high. I cleared my mind, meditating on a valley
covered in snow with roses blooming in the cold. The anguish. The desire.
Neither would ever let go of my soul. I told them to let go. My mind was
pulsing. My heart pushing. The blood roaming. I took the teeth out of my
head and slid them across the table. Dimity picked them up and put them
in
his mouth, biting into the rubbery gums with his own set of mismatched
teeth.
</p>
<p>
"Sat. Is. Fac. Tion." He snapped each syllable out, his jaw stuck open.
"At. Last."
</p>
<p>
That's when the blood poisoning hit him. It hit him hard. His throat
swelled up. He couldn't breathe. The room stilled. The blind waited. The
world spun. He kept hitting the table. Then he fell over. I searched the
edge of the table, found the deck of cards, split it, and dealt another
round. When you've survived the soul mines, the little things no longer
matter. Satisfaction is merely a mortal wound.
</p>
<p>
I won that next round of cards. I won and owed no one. I took my teeth back
from Dimity and put them back in my mouth. With my winnings, I bought a
ship and filled it with my blind neighbors, giving them each a berth to
sleep in. The cracks in my mind grew wider now. I drove the ship hard,
bringing everyone back to my home world. After passing through the cold
atmosphere, I landed the ship next to the valley of the shaman.
</p>
<p>
For the blind, there's a land with no thorns, a place where there's nothing
to puncture the skin and let the poison out. There, the sun rises in the
sky and the roses come alive, the snow melting, fresh water cascading down
into the valley below. When I asked the blind what they thought about the
place, they said it was a little cold there, but beautiful.
</p>
<p>
We taught the shaman how to play cards. He'd never seen a game of chance
before. I searched the edge of the table, found the deck of cards, split
it, and dealt another round. He never won a single round. He died the next
day, leaving me heir to the temple. My acolytes help me maintain order,
although they can't see. We receive donations from an anonymous source,
someone who always signs as "K". I'm pretty sure they come from Kathra, who
is rich beyond imagination today, the queen of Kelgon salts.
</p>
<p>
Those who are in pain come to us from across the universe. We teach them to
slow their hearts and ease their minds. We pick rose petals from the roses
growing in the valley and make cups of tea. We give the tea out to those
who visit us, who pray to a deity that has no likeness.
</p>
