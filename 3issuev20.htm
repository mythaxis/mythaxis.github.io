<div><i><b>&#147;The unassuming youth seeking instruction with humility
gains good fortune.&#148;</b><br> I Ching</i>
<p class=drop>Matt Davidson had lived in Edinburgh for
most of his adult life; he had walked past the Drill Hall's
unprepossessing entry a hundred times. It was a short, dark, lane
running between tenement buildings, paved with the grey cobbles that
still abounded in many run-down corners of the city.
The lane was just wide enough for a single large vehicle. Scrapes on
the walls of the lane indicated that it had proved too narrow for some.
Matt entered the lane, automatically noting the smells of used beer,
urine and vomit which such a Saturday night haven inevitably attracted.
The lane ended a few metres in, at a huge double door in a featureless
wall. A wicket gate and a new entry phone were set into the right hand
double door. <div class=pullquote>&#147;Before the beginning of great brilliance, there must be chaos. Before
a brilliant person begins something great, they must look foolish in the
crowd.&#148;<br> I Ching</div>
 
Now, having checked the address in his iPda and read the tiny notice on
the door's flaking green paint, he pressed the bell push on the entry
speaker. The speaker hummed for a second, and Matt drew breath to
announce himself, only to be interrupted by an impatient voice saying:
"It's open!". <P>The "Drill Hall" wasn't so much a building as a  contained space, a
tapered quadrilateral about half the area of a football field.
White-painted brick walls without windows rose to an impressive height.
Around the perimeter were iron columns, patterned after the classical
style, sprouting at their capitals a remarkably intricate tracery of
iron frames, the support for a domed glass roof. Most of the panes were
the original glass, totally obscured  by the soot of decades of
Edinburgh smoke. Students of Victorian railway stations would recognise
the architectural style. Fluorescent strip lights dangled from cables
strung across the width of the building. In the centre of the hall
lurked a jumble of heavy machinery. <P>A lean middle-aged man with a couple of day's growth of beard was
walking towards him. "Calvin Yelland," he said. "You'll be Davidson." <P>"Yes, Professor." They shook hands. Yelland's was wrinkled, cold, dry. <P>"Graduate Research Assistant Matthew Davidson," said Yelland, with the
unfocussed look of one quoting from a remembered document, "Four years
of university, resulting in an impressive degree in Oriental Studies.
Hardly ideal for an pioneering physics project in a cold laboratory, one
might think, and a strange decision from you, I dare say, but <i>we</i>
want a non-scientist for a change, while <i>you</i>, according to your
application, want something completely different. Welcome to the
fridge." <P>Matt couldn't be sure whether Yelland's sour expression was for himself
or for the building. "I... Er... Unusual location." <P>"We're lucky to have it. Lots of room, but it isn't ideal, either.
Damned cold, roof leaks, and it was full of junk you wouldn't believe
when we got here, but no rats at least. They probably have more sense.
Belongs to the University." <P>"Really?" <P>"Oh, yes," Yelland's gaze became distracted again as he appeared to
visualise another remembered document. "Originally built in the late
1800s as an off-site lecture hall, but it has hopelessly echoing
acoustics and was only used for one semester. The Natural Philosophy
department has sporadically rented it out since 1890. It's been used as
a church hall by various religions and denominations, as a museum
warehouse, a dance hall, a variety theatre, a stable for the Co-op draft
horses in the 1930s - hence the faint dung heap aroma - a cinema, and,
during World War 2, as the HQ of a Royal Signals regiment. That's when
it was first called 'The Drill Hall'. Most recently it's been an indoor
karting track - hence the lingering air of petrol fumes  and burnt
rubber - a five-a-side football court, and a karate studio. I gather
that in none of its many r&#244;les has it proved ideal." <P>"I see. Cold, though, as you say." <P>"It's heated, to an extent, by these massive iron radiators, powered by
an oil-fired furnace that seems have been salvaged from a scrapped ocean
liner. But the volume of the building and the single-glazed glass roof
means that it never feels anything but desperately cold unless you're
actually leaning on a radiator... " His manner cheered a little, "No
need for air conditioning, though, even in summer. One of the previous
tenants built a few hutches for offices around half a dozen radiators at
the back. They're warmer. Come."  <P><p class=drop>Two offices were busy with several young men debating
equations on whiteboards, another with two older men in overalls
surrounded by racks of equipment. Two offices appeared to be filled with
machine tools. Yelland and Matt entered a near-vacant office, which was
only half full of equipment, leaving room for a desk and a couple of
chairs. <P>"You know what we're doing here," said Yelland, but with a question in
his voice. <P>"I gather it's some kind of physics research. Eh, quantum something.
Black holes. 'Exotic', the notification said." <P>"Hmm..." Yelland almost smiled. "Refreshing to speak to someone who
isn't either totally convinced or thoroughly sceptical. Yes, it's
original research. Wormholes in multi-dimensional space. The future of
faster-than-light space exploration, time travel and other science
fictional dreams. Look up the Wikipedia article on wormholes. Let me
know if you understand it. <P>"It is not widely known," Yelland continued, "that, last year, using an
amazing amount of energy, a research team at Caltech created a wormhole
a few millimetres in width and about a metre in length. Nevertheless,
this tiny hole nearly killed the researchers and destroyed a laboratory,
because the other end of the  wormhole was in the vacuum of space, and
naturally began to suck the air out of the lab. Luckily, the wormhole
closed down, pinched off. They usually do." <P>"How was the other end in space if it was only a metre long? This is a
silly question, isn't it?" said Matt. <P>"Not really, and the answer may clarify what our problem is here. A
wormhole connects two points in space-time, and we tend to think of
space as regularly structured as we experience it in our lives, but a
wormhole spans space in a totally different fashion. In principle,
looking through a one metre wormhole, you might perceive something that
is half a million miles and a year away in our space-time, and it would
appear to be just one metre away at the other end of the hole. Though,
in reality, a view through a wormhole would necessarily be misleading." <P>"And my situation here?" <P>"First, there's a lot of reading to do, some mathematics to learn.
Nothing too taxing, and the young Fountain here will help you. But we
need someone to observe what we're doing, and to make sense of it. The
rest of us are too busy with the technology. There's a PhD in it for you
if you make a success of it. You see, I've read some of your essays on
oriental culture, beliefs and customs, and you have a proven and rare
ability clearly to communicate alien ideas, such as Zen, Confucianism
and the Book of Changes, for example, to readers like myself with no
background in the subject. You are to be the eyes, ears and voice of the
project." <P><p class = drop>Matt buried himself in mathematics, from which he
learned little, and read primers on special and general relativity,
which stretched his ability to visualise space and time.<div
 class=pullquote>&#147;Perseverance alone does not assure success. No amount of stalking will
lead to game in a field that has none.&#148;<br> I Ching</div> <P>Every couple of days, the gas turbine would be started, generating,
according to the engineers, enough electricity to supply a small city.
The generator was a bulky green machine which lurked like a giant toad,
as high as a man, against one wall. The Drill Hall briefly warmed up as
the jet exhaust glowed red hot, and the noise was enormous, despite the
fact that the exhaust was directed in a pipe up the wall and outside.
The resulting electric power was directed into the Wormhole Reactor, an
even larger machine shaped ike a cotton reel, basically a fat cylinder
the diameter of a railway tunnel with a one metre hollow space down its
centre. <P>On a good day, a sparkling sphere the size of a grape would blink into
existence just inside the hollow for a moment. The entrance, Matt was
told, to a wormhole. A sphere, because it was a three-dimensional hole
in multi-dimensional space-time. These unimpressive phenomena gave
immense satisfaction to the physicists. Matt learned that these
wormholes were the largest, by a factor of a thousand, that had ever
been created anywhere in the world, and that their short flicker
represented a thousand-fold lengthening of their existence, wormholes
being inclined to collapse very quickly. <P>And so it continued for some months, the climate in the Drill Hall
gradually softening from arctic to mere terribly cold, and moisture
condensing on metal surfaces so that alarming elecric arcs accompanied
the powering up of the Reactor, snaking around the cylinder until it
heated up. Pools of water accumulated around the bases of the pillars.
Drips from the glass ceiling spattled on the turbine exhaust, causing
little clouds of steam. The tiny spheres appearing in the cylinder were
sometimes larger, often longer-lived, than Matt had originally seen, but
as the project seemed to be in <i>stasis</i>, he began to show signs of
discontent and doubt over his decision to join the project. Only
Yelland, Fountain - one of the young physicists, Gazzer the technician
and Matt himself turned up on a regular basis. <P><p class=drop>Then came the breakthrough. Fountain attempted a
re-formulation of the equations they were using. Yelland and he noisily
disputed the validity of Fountain's idea for days, covering the
whiteboard in symbols, crossings-out and parenthetic notes. Eventually,
in face of the slow progress they had been making, Yelland agreed to
give it a try, despite the fact that it would require a partial rebuild
of the Reactor and re-programming of the cybernetic control
functions.<div class=pullquote>&#147;When the way comes to an end, then change. Having changed, you pass
through.&#148;<br> I Ching</div> <P>The scientists and engineers turned out in full force, overnights and
weekends being worked. Yet it took a full six weeks to make the changes. <P>In the meantime, excess to requirements, Matt seized the opportunity to
take a two-week vacation in Beijing, studying documents and artifacts he
had previously only known at second hand. He therefore returned to
the
Drill Hall refreshed and enthusiastic. The Wormhole Reactor had
sprouted
a few more bulges and cables, and there were signs of extensive surgery
in a ring around the edge of the outer cylinder. <P>For the first three weeks, the remodelled Reactor appeared
totally useless, and not even the little ephemeral spheres appeared. The
other researchers and one of the engineers drifted away from the
project. Yelland spent much of his time moping in his office. <P>Then Fountain discovered what he called a 'schoolboy error' in the
cybernetic program. <P>At the next test of the new Reactor, the sphere representing the
wormhole entrance was much larger than any previous, and it persisted
until the Reactor was switched off. <P>In great excitement, some adjustments were made and the Reactor powered
up again. Matt couldn't follow the details of the activity, but he could
see the glimmering sphere getting bigger at each attempt, and it showed
no sign of collapse while power was applied. <P>A few days later, a maximum size appeared to have been reached. The
sphere was by then about the size of a grapefruit. Fountain was
particularly triumphant, Yelland somewhat gratified. Cameras clicked,
measurements were taken. The wormhole entrance glowed. <P><p class=drop>A Monday morning in August, daylight struggling through
the glass roof, and the air tingling with anticipation, the Reactor was
fired up for a serious test run. Serious it might be, yet it was
primitive in its aims.<div class=pullquote>&#147;The responses of human beings vary greatly under dangerous
circumstances. The strong man advances boldly to meet them head on. The
weak man grows agitated. But the superior man stands up to fate, endures
resolutely in his inner certainty <br> I Ching</div> <P>Fountain took a wooden ruler and pushed it cautiously at the sphere,
making sure that his fingers stayed outside. The
ruler disappeared into the surface of the sphere, but did not emerge
from the opposite side. He withdrew it carefully. It appeared
intact.
It was a weird sight. The longest piece of wood that could readily be
found was a walking stick. It proved possible to push it into the sphere
so that it disappeared to nearly its full length and to withdraw it
again, unharmed. <P>"If it's connected to somewhere distant, why can we not see that distant
place?" Matt asked Yelland, as they contemplated the sphere. <P>"Unfortunately," Yelland replied, "the exotic material that lines the
wormhole and keeps it open attracts any photons that come through from
the other side and scatters the image, so it will always be out of
focus." <P>"So why don't we send a camera through and record what's there?" <P>Yelland stared at him. It was clear he hadn't thought of it. "Anyone got
a smartphone and selfie stick?" he called. <P>Gazzer the engineer obliged, but when the camera was withdrawn, the
image was just as blurred as the sphere. <P>"C'mon. Any more ideas?" <P>"How about sending a cat through?" suggested Fountain. <P>"It's a bit tight," said Matt. "We could send a mouse down." <P>It took just half an hour to fetch a couple of white mice from the
University's Easter Road pharmaceutical lab. Matt made a little harness
and lead from a length of thin electrical wire. The mouse slipped easily
into the sphere, disappeared and pulled the lead a short distance
further, then stopped for a while, and finally reappeared, apparently
none the worse. <P>Emboldened by the mouse's survival, Matt stepped forward and poked a
tentative finger into the sphere. Yelland shouted "Careful! You
could
lose the finger if it collapsed!" <P>Matt withdrew the finger. "I expected it to tingle, but it didn't.
Nothing at all, really." He pushed his whole hand in. <P>"No, no. Careful!" said Yelland, but he made no move to stop him. <P>"How long is this wormhole, anyway?" Matt asked. <P>"We don't know exactly," said Fountain, "Could be anything from a few
centimetres to a few light-years. The quantum calculations are typically
non-specific as to their solution." <P>"Ok," said Matt, "what say I reach a bit further?" <P>"Well..." said Fountain. <P>Matt took a deep breath and thrust his hand and forearm deeper. "Feels
smooth, a little above room temperature. I'm twiddling my fingers. Yes,
it's slightly slippery, and quite straight. I can't feel any passage of
air. I'll just..." He withdrew the arm and stripped off his pullover and
shirt. <P>"Are you sure?" said Yelland, though it was clear that he and Fountain
were no longer going to dissuade Matt. <P>Matt pushed his arm back in, cautiously this time, past the elbow.
"Mmm... No change, it's... Ow!" He jerked and pulled back a bit. The
other
two jumped as well. <P>"What?" <P>"I felt something. It moved. I'm just trying again. Yes. It's still
there." It feels like... Weird." <P>Yelland and Fountain were staring aghast. "Weird? What is it? Metal?
Plastic?
What temperature?" asked Yelland. <P>"It's, ah, like... flesh, really." <P>"What?" <P><div class=pullquote>&#147;If one is not extremely careful, Somebody may
come up from behind and
strike him. Misfortune.&#148;<br> I Ching</div>
"Yes. Yes. It's a hand, and it's moving again. Just feeling it. It's a
human hand all right! I'm clasping it. Wait. I think it's my
<I>own</I> hand! I'm shaking hands with myself! I'm reaching a little
further. Yes. I can feel my wristwatch, and I can feel the other hand
feeling my watch. It's a loop, isn't it?" <P>Stunned silence. Fountain and Yelland looked at each other. <P>"Yes, it is," said Yelland. "We must take another look at these
equations. Congratulations, Fountain, I think we've just built the first
multi-dimensional M&ouml;bius doughnut." <P><small>&copy; Gil Williamson 2017 All Rights Reserved
