<div><i>Almost poetry, this study of experimental subjects under pressure.</i>
<p class=drop>Morning comes, and I have never slept in my life. A frustrated
non-drama that sends me into the world like a kicking and screaming
rebirth. Endless, restless nights haunting me. End of the world winds
whipping against the bullet-proof glass of the modular apartments.
Trapped by the environment again, like lab rats caged. She sleeps
soundlessly in the large empty bed, while I toss and turn like a dying
man on the too compact sofa. I roll over with surrender and dismay,
rest feet on floor, elbows on knees, head in hands. Eyes closed, I
breathe raggedly, rubbing hands against scalding stubble. Opening eyes
with gravity's reluctance, 
I take in her too slim, too young form,
spread in jigsaw contortions, blond fluff halo. Thin white t-shirt,
nearly transparent, rucked across bare stomach. She wears a thong,
disappearing into elusive and tantalising cracks. I shake my head, try
to break thoughts back into shards, derail that train from perilous
tracks, and fail. Life between my thighs, grows, rigid, threatening
and dominant. My stomach leaps with fear, that she will wake, and find
me sitting there, desolate and aroused. The last time we spoke we
fought, she said she hated me. Like I need to encourage her disdain by
letting her find me like this. Despite that I touch myself; unbendable
thing, that unrelenting beast. I choke on my cry, slumping, hands
thrown aside, and it stands there. I look at her lying there, and she
moans and moves, but doesn't wake, and the beast goes deeper in me,
and the thing called lust roars. <P><div class=pullquote>Men! Useless bastards, the lot of them.</div>
Unsteady and precarious with denial I stumble to the door, the double
layers that provide an air lock. Our suits hang there. I look out
upon my internal struggle, a Martian surface scoured by the latest
storm front, reflecting and causing the turmoil inside. These pioneer
habitations, two half moons, a dense reliant community, become a
series of isolation cells. I breathe the air of souring captivity. Red
dust, like hell's very own fabric, lifted from Martian earth and
turned to devil spirals. Between us the notion of a road, an accepted
and shared concept between the members of the colony, it's just another
fucking red strip of seared surface. The other crescent of apartments
across the way, identical to this one. Three flats along, in opposite
position from here another man stands, looking out as though into
hell. We press our hands against this specially engineered glass,
taunting each other, like mirror images that we will use to torture
ourselves. I bet his partner still loves him; I bet he is still happy
with his role in this great adventure. Great adventure, a conceptual
kick to the head, and I slide to the floor, back against the hatch,
bare hands and feet against the coarse, cheap pod floor covering. <P>Cabin fever induces madness, I recognise this fact, we recognise this
fact; Martian fever is worse, the inherent idea of the alien. We were
told about this fact in orientation, prepared in sequences of
psychological tests and appraisals. Regardless, we step from familiar
planetary territories into brave new worlds, with foolish confidence
and self-assurance. Not until you are here, laid bare for the demonic
influence, for the endless tests and appraisals, can you understand.
Not until you find yourself constrained to quarters due to surface
planetary environmental conditions can you understand. Confined again,
till you feel you have spent more time trapped here than you ever did
doing your job. Scientists, explorers, adventurers, and pioneers from
the home planet searching for ways out of the horror of what we left
behind. Only to find a new horror in front, we were not designed for
this life-style, though the suggestion is that we will adapt. Rats in
a cage, we are experimental subjects abused and prodded, tick boxes on
checklists. When the storm dissipates, we will be put on the wheel
once more, running to go nowhere through all the trick questions and
character assassinations. Encouraged to inform on each other, all
those questions, like being trapped with this bitch, waiting to find
she betrayed me, wanting to strangle her, wanting to... I shake my
head free of those thoughts again. Look at her sweet face - god -
innocent and unknowing. Slight silent sighs escape me, slight silent
voice, tainted by loneliness, bitch. <P>How the fuck can she sleep through this? There is a constant sound
here, the sound of filters and processors; those back stage mechanics
that keep us alive. Air filters and re-processors, recycle units
capturing and regurgitating ancillary matter, food dispensers. All
connected to the hub unit of each block, run by endless programs and
systems. Blind, unspeaking sentience that controls everything we do in
this place? You learn to filter those sounds out, but when the storm
hits... we are on a new level, the kind of howling nightmare that
triggers fever dreams and lyrical waxing. That batters you from sleep,
bloody eyed and at the end of your tether. Full of hurt and bloody
hate. I release my fists, stretch out the suddenly gathered tension
from my knuckles. It lasts only a moment, before I clench again,
violent desire demanding animal action - go on, lash out, express the
emotion. No. <P>Enough. I drag myself to the shower cubicle. Start the water running
hard. And I hurt myself. And hurt myself. Head against the smooth bare
wall. Till I think my knees will give in, till I grunt, till I hurt no
more. Hands against the wall, water washes everything away. If I focus
on that sound, let it fill me, for a moment I can forget. For a
moment. Sleeplessness hits me, tidal waves of exhaustion battering my
merely human body. I drag myself back to the sofa. Too small for me,
but I curl up as best I can, hug myself, close my eyes, and pray for
sleep. Please, God, let me sleep through this hellish night, this
relentless storm.
 
<p class=drop>Dark outside, the storm still rages, dust particles whipping around.
Lashing our building with their fine composition. Fall asleep
exhausted - sleep all day - wake up exhausted. For three days now I
have done nothing. Why do I ache so much? This confinement becomes
frustrating and dizzying. Living on edge, little tensions become
exaggerated. The waiting is difficult. Like that night before we took
off, drawn out endlessly till it grows hollow. I tug my t-shirt down,
it's rolled up while I slept. I sit there, dazed, legs half crossed,
and shoulder slumped. Tired. I'm in our bed. Alone again. Alone since
we fought, things got out of hand so quickly. Look at him. Naked on
the sofa. My man. My bear. Look at the size of him - his chest, those
arms. I want to leap on him. Wrap myself around him. I want to hold
him to me. Look at him. I hug myself. <P>So quick with his shouting. Pig headed bastard. Doesn't he know I just
want him to hold me? Doesn't he know how hard it is to be trapped in
here waiting? I get so mad at everything; I end up telling him I hate
him. It makes me want to hit him. Kill him in his sleep. But I don't
even have a knife. Food comes from the hatch, ready to eat with a
spoon. You would almost think that was a deliberate move? Are those
management bastards playing with us? Are cameras recording everything
even now? Did they know it would be this bad? They told us it would be
this bad. Did we listen to them? Did we understand when they said it
would be difficult, that it would be like this? I want to brush my
hand through his hair, and to beat him to death with a spoon. I laugh,
hold myself against a cold wave, against foolishness. <P>I throw myself out of bed; a clambering, graceless child. With my
skinny limbs, no wonder he doesn't find me attractive, there is
nothing of me. I pad across the floor, quietly. Standing over him, too
big for this makeshift bed, but he refused to share with me, or I with
him, one of the two. Reaching out, hesitating, finger tips so close,
close enough to touch. Look at his face, fierce and scowling. Look at
him, he plans to kill me in my sleep. Look at him, naked and
vulnerable now. Cupping himself, what is that about? Is it comforting?
Is it sexual? I don't know. I crouch beside him, mimicking him. Puff
my cheeks out - ook. Look at you, barely evolved past the gorilla.
How I want you. Sink to my knees, emptied out by thoughts of sex.
Emptied out by hunger, by that barren empty void inside. If it had
teeth it would eat you, man! I would eat you alive! Close my eyes and
breathe. Ache. A second pulsing organ in my body, a sense of life.
Breathe deeper, breathe to fight the feeling. <P>I stand, straighten and stretch. Can I touch the ceiling of the pod? I
brush it lightly, such a tiny place for two people to live in. No
wonder we are bouncing off each other. I pad to the toilet, stalking
silently. Don't want to wake him, make him mad. A hole in the floor,
to squat over, underwear poised round my knees. Welcome to the future,
welcome to the hole in the ground, the luxury of being the first and
the finest. Pissing into a tank beneath the floor contents flushing
into the recycling system. Yum. Tug the tiny pair of knickers back on,
for all the difference they make. He still won't touch me. <P>In a gesture of design cunning, the food/drink dispenser is beside the
shower/toilet facility. Don't think of the cyclical nature of the
system, I come out and push the button for coffee. Men! Shitting where
they eat! Wasn't that rule one in the survival guide? When did
whatever optimum tick box that is responsible for that choice outweigh
the basic rules of survival. I taste the coffee - it still tastes
bitter, still tastes wrong. I take a mouthful of denial. And just
drink the stuff. Men! Useless bastards, the lot of them. <P>I walk back to the sofa. Standing over him, I feel a hundred feet
tall, towering over him. I consider pouring the coffee over him. But
it's not even hot enough to cause a memorable burn. And it might taste
like shit, but it is the only option we have. I shrug, and take
another mouthful. Close my eyes and think mechanical thoughts about
mechanical actions, and how I want to do those mechanical things.
Bastard. So I shrug and stroll over to the bed. I grab the blanket;
one of those absurd new fabrics designed especially for life on Mars,
and drag it behind me. Drag it to the air lock, lots of glass,
specially engineered, rocket ship seals round it to keep it all in
place and intact, designed to resist the storm outside at its worst. I
hunker down, place the coffee in front of me, and wrap the blanket
round myself. Not that it's cold, these pods are maintained at a
comfortable level by the hub. It's a comfort thing, to feel as though
I am held, encompassed. I cup the coffee in my hands, and settle down
to watch the storm. Hypnotised and fascinated by the patterns of the
dust. The chaotic flow of turbulent streams. Such vivid, violent reds,
even at night; the place seems alive, transformed and wondrous. One
moment everything is gone, consumed by dust. The next there are
patches of clarity, the identical block across the road visible. There
are lights on in some windows others are dark. Two blocks, 25 flats in
each, each built to hold a couple. We are the first 100 people on
Mars, and it pulses with a startling violence.  <P>
