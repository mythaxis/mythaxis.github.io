            <p>Welcome to the second annual <em>All Crime</em> issue of <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em>! Not only that, but the capstone issue of my fifth year as editor of the zine, a fact that gives me no small flicker of pride.</p>
<p>This time around we aim to give you a bit of everything. We have stories ranging from the modern to the classic mode, with Jess Simms&rsquo; cut-throat corporate hostilities at one extreme and Arlen Feldman&rsquo;s escapades on the cernival circuit at the other. We arguably experiment with form: Michael Betterndorf&rsquo;s quartet of character studies tells a tetraptych tale; David Sheskin&rsquo;s break-neck bulletin reduces people to their base statistics and serves them up as a monoparagraphic mélange. And courtesy of Kirk Bueckert and P.R. O&rsquo;Leary we have, respectively, a monster that surely cannot really be and the possibility of monstrousness we all have the potential to embody.</p>
<p>Add to this a smattering of opinion, with Bill Ryan&rsquo;s latest longform essay and my own short reviews of other crime fic published around the web in 2024, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find something to keep your mind and hands off killing the in-laws during this festive season! So let me hold you back no more (or, as the case may be, <em>begin</em>) – go forth and enjoy!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…oh, hmm, hello, well, since you’re still here: I&rsquo;m going to break with untold years of <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> tradition and engage in a little shameless self-promotion. And the reason? Well, almost exactly one month ago, I learned that my first dedicated crime short story had been accepted into the forthcoming anthology <strong>Motives Unknown</strong>, featuring twelve stories by authors with a connection to the north of England. It&rsquo;s to be released by plucky indie publishers <em>Dead Ink Books</em> in May 2025, and you can check out the cover (and maybe even order a copy) <em><a href="https://deadinkbooks.com/product/motives-unknown-a-northern-crime-anthology/">here</a></em>. I’m sure I wouldn’t be so crass as to review my own work in next year’s crime-fic round up…</p>
<p>…well, <em>reasonably</em> sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, I love crime writing, and it&rsquo;s as much a privilege to add to what&rsquo;s out there personally as it is to present to you the pieces in this very issue by our talented contributors. So enough from me, and over to them!</p>

						<em><strong>Andrew</strong> is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing</em> Mythaxis <em>he has been published in a small handful of quality zines, and co-authored a serialised alternate history adventure novel. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesn’t <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewleonhudson">do things online</a> often enough to count.</em></p>

					<p><strong>ISSUE 40</strong> – <em><strong>Thanks and Salutations!</strong></em>
&lsquo;<em>When it&rsquo;s late at night – and you&rsquo;re roaming around because you can&rsquo;t get to sleep – the slightest sound may take on a scary quality. You imagine things. Things you&rsquo;d never think of – if you weren&rsquo;t so tired and edgy. But why – WHY – you ask yourself, are you so jumpy and wide awake? Could it be the coffee you had?&rsquo;</em> Yes, once more our all-crime cover image is from a 1948 ad for decaffeinated Sanka Coffee painted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Siebel">Fritz Siebel</a>. Unfortunately, that makes us seventy-six years too late to enjoy <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanka_Coffee_-_Was_that_someone_at_the_window,_1948.jpg">the Hilarious NEW Sanka Coffee Show – starring <em>funster</em> Danny Thomas</a> – according to the copy…</p>
