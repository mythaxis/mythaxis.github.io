            <glyph >I</glyph>


<p>Follow me, children, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>Across concrete bridges strangled by vines</p>
<p>Down deserted streets marked by meaningless lines</p>
<p>Around the metal husks of cars</p>
<p>become the nests of beasts</p>
<p>We will stay away from the buildings</p>
<p>Where only the dead reside</p>
<p>Waiting on unpowered elevators</p>
<p>That will never rise</p>
<p>To the shrine that stands in the midst of the city</p>
<p>I will show you where our new beginning began</p>
<p>Grandfather grunts</p>
<p>Tell them the truth this time, he says, not the pretty myth you made</p>
<p>They deserve to know about—</p>
<p>I will tell it the only way they will understand, Grandmother says</p>
<p>Too many words have been forgotten, and the parts I’ve left out</p>
<p>would mean nothing to them without a background in virology,</p>
<p>parasitology and applied microbiology</p>
<p>See? Look how confused the children are,</p>
<p>scratching their heads</p>
<p>Science is dead</p>
<p>You and I killed it</p>
<p>Best tell them my myth instead</p>
<glyph >II</glyph>


<p>Grandfather sees</p>
<p>A squat white building with busted out windows</p>
<p>And the skeletons of his former colleagues</p>
<p>The summer rains have come early</p>
<p>And flooded the stairs</p>
<p>He sees it the way it once was</p>
<p>Busy and alive</p>
<p>The stone globe in the courtyard</p>
<p>Three rooster statues crowing</p>
<p>One statue shattered by the bomb-throwing</p>
<p>terrorist that gave him his limp</p>
<p>This is the place, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>the home of our ancestral tribe</p>
<p>And when the sickness came to us</p>
<p>We brought our babies here to die</p>
<p>See the moss-eaten rocks of vague avian shape</p>
<p>clutching water-smooth stones with their feet?</p>
<p>This is where Lord Rooster was born</p>
<p>And mistakes we must never repeat.</p>
<p>Find a dry place to sit, now</p>
<p>The tale is not long the way that I tell it</p>
<p>You tell it wrong, Grandfather thinks</p>
<glyph >III</glyph>


<p>Grandmother’s Myth</p>
<p>When your grandfather and I were young</p>
<p>Mankind had learned to fear</p>
<p>The curses beasts could pass to us</p>
<p>And their knowledge we held dear</p>
<p>Lord Rat was eldest bearer of these maladies</p>
<p>A black shape skittering through our heads</p>
<p>The fleas he carried with him</p>
<p>Would bite us in our beds</p>
<p>And in eight days</p>
<p>the bells would toll</p>
<p>Announcing you were dead</p>
<p>Lord Cow was subtle for his size</p>
<p>The madness he carried in his flesh</p>
<p>Would pass to those who ate him,</p>
<p>Even when his meat was fresh</p>
<p>And in a week</p>
<p>The brain you had</p>
<p>would be a runny mess</p>
<p>Lord Monkey was a tricky one</p>
<p>Plotting from his treetop throne</p>
<p>His curse stripped away immunity</p>
<p>So other sicknesses could grow</p>
<p>And without fail,</p>
<p>the tamest colds</p>
<p>would strike us dead in droves</p>
<p>But it was Lord Rooster we feared the most</p>
<p>For though his wings couldn&rsquo;t take him far</p>
<p>the little birds he consorted with</p>
<p>Were numerous as the stars</p>
<p>And when they sang</p>
<p>At morning’s light</p>
<p>Lungs seized and ceased to draw</p>
<p>No one could stop the spreading death</p>
<p>When Lord Rooster walked the earth</p>
<p>But your grandfather defeated him</p>
<p>How? I will start with Rooster&rsquo;s birth—</p>
<glyph >IV</glyph>


<p>Grandfather interrupts</p>
<p>They were viruses, you understand?</p>
<p>The sniffles? The coughs?</p>
<p>He tries to find a way to explain</p>
<p>Concepts that no longer exist</p>
<p>Small creatures, living things</p>
<p>Invisible and discrete</p>
<p>Were they ghosts? the children ask</p>
<p>No, he says</p>
<p>Lines of code in double helix</p>
<p>Do you remember when we</p>
<p>Grafted the peach and the plum tree?</p>
<p>When I cut a branch from the one and</p>
<p>Inserted it</p>
<p>Into the other’s cleft</p>
<p>So we would have plums out of season?</p>
<p>Viruses are like that</p>
<p>They are the scion,</p>
<p>We are the stock</p>
<p>They graft themselves to us</p>
<p>And together we bear fruit</p>
<p>The children stare up at him, baffled</p>
<p>The littlest one asks if Lord Monkey was a tree</p>
<p>Grandfather tries to think of a better metaphor,</p>
<p>Until he sees his wife’s smile</p>
<p>He sighs</p>
<p>Just listen to Grandmother’s story, he says</p>
<p>And walks off a ways to sit alone</p>
<p>Staring at the rooster statues</p>
<p>Still crowing at the dead stone globe</p>
<glyph >V</glyph>


<p>Ignore Grandfather, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>Look over there</p>
<p>See where the rooster statues stand?</p>
<p>This is where our elders sinned</p>
<p>And gave their last command</p>
<p>They fought a war they could not win</p>
<p>But so wicked were their ways</p>
<p>They summoned up Lord Rooster</p>
<p>And used him like a slave</p>
<p>They sent him to their enemies</p>
<p>Without considering the cost</p>
<p>For when their enemies lay dead</p>
<p>Lord Rooster remained aloft</p>
<p>They built this shrine to summon him</p>
<p>Trusting glass tubes to hold him in thrall</p>
<p>Then brought their children as a sacrifice</p>
<p>And laid them on his claws</p>
<p>Come to this place, sick spirit, they cried</p>
<p>voices rising above the wind</p>
<p>Come drink your fill of our children</p>
<p>We will pay in blood for our sin</p>
<p>Then with their knives they plunged deep</p>
<p>And reddened water from a bloody creek</p>
<p>rolled down the comb and wet the beak</p>
<p>Lord Rooster was born in a droplet—</p>
<p>A bird thing, his mind gone thin</p>
<p>The statue cracked</p>
<p>The droplet dropped</p>
<p>The sickness took to wing</p>
<p>And In the dying dark of night</p>
<p>Lord Rooster began to sing</p>
<glyph >VI</glyph>


<p>Grandfather clears his throat</p>
<p>They were not children we made sick</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<p>Embryonic stem cells never lived</p>
<p>An egg is not a chick</p>
<p>Our work was ordained</p>
<p>Sanctioned from on high</p>
<p>By government officials</p>
<p>Who wished to never die</p>
<p>They told us to open the disease</p>
<p>We unzipped it</p>
<p>Read nature&rsquo;s code like data decrypted</p>
<p>Rewrote its essence to be useful</p>
<p>And implanted our lie so well</p>
<p>The human body swore that it was truthful</p>
<p>Listen to me, my grandchildren,</p>
<p>Lord Rooster is nothing but the name</p>
<p>We gave it when it jumped from birds to men</p>
<p>The statue did not awaken</p>
<p>We are not paying for our sin</p>
<glyph >VII</glyph>


<p>Grandfather’s memory is going, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>But I remember it rightly</p>
<p>The sun rising, the fluttering wings</p>
<p>Shedding rock and debris to reveal</p>
<p>A skinny raw thing</p>
<p>With its mouth open wide</p>
<p>And to it we villagers kneeled</p>
<p>We nourished him with blood until he grew strong</p>
<p>White and crimson feathers sprouted</p>
<p>His granite beak took a yellow hue</p>
<p>And when we pointed him towards the east</p>
<p>To our enemies he flew</p>
<p>The littlest grandchild asks,</p>
<p>What do these words mean, Papa</p>
<p>In the place where Lord Rooster once perched?</p>
<p>My company’s motto, Grandfather replies</p>
<p>Our knowledge will light the Earth</p>
<p>How did you stop him grandpa?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Lord Rooster, the child says</p>
<p>Grandfather looks away</p>
<p>With shame in his eyes</p>
<p>He says, I did a bad thing</p>
<p>No, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>You saved so many lives</p>
<p>Tell the story how you wish, he says</p>
<p>But leave me out of it</p>
<p>He turns and walks away</p>
<p>Towards the ruined city</p>
<p>They will be safe without him</p>
<p>On their return to the homestead</p>
<p>A side effect of the cure:</p>
<p>All the muggers are long dead</p>
<p>He perches himself on some rubble, brooding</p>
<p>Mist rises from cracked streets like ghosts</p>
<p>The surest way to kill a virus</p>
<p>Is to kill every possible host</p>
<p>Which he has done</p>
<p>It was easy and over fast</p>
<p>Everything but the regret</p>
<p>He lapses into a long silence, thinking</p>
<p>I am the reason there are no more birds</p>
<p>Hours later, the sun rises over a dead city</p>
<p>Nothing crows</p>
