            <h2 id="i">I</h2>
<p>Follow me, children, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>Across concrete bridges strangled by vines<br>
Down deserted streets marked by meaningless lines<br>
Around the metal husks of cars<br>
Become the nests of beasts</p>
<p>We will stay away from the buildings<br>
Where only the dead reside<br>
Waiting on unpowered elevators<br>
That will never rise</p>
<p>To the shrine that stands in the midst of the city<br>
I will show you where our new beginning began</p>
<p>Grandfather grunts<br>
Tell them the truth this time, he says, not the pretty myth you made<br>
They deserve to know about—</p>
<p>I will tell it the only way they will understand, Grandmother says<br>
Too many words have been forgotten, and the parts I’ve left out<br>
Would mean nothing to them without a background in virology,<br>
Parasitology and applied microbiology</p>
<p>See? Look how confused the children are,<br>
Scratching their heads<br>
Science is dead<br>
You and I killed it<br>
Best tell them my myth instead</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>Grandfather sees<br>
A squat white building with busted out windows<br>
And the skeletons of his former colleagues</p>
<p>The summer rains have come early<br>
And flooded the stairs</p>
<p>He sees it the way it once was<br>
Busy and alive</p>
<p>The stone globe in the courtyard<br>
Three rooster statues crowing<br>
One statue shattered by the bomb-throwing<br>
Terrorist that gave him his limp</p>
<p>This is the place, Grandmother says,<br>
The home of our ancestral tribe<br>
And when the sickness came to us<br>
We brought our babies here to die</p>
<p>See the moss-eaten rocks of vague avian shape<br>
Clutching water-smooth stones with their feet?<br>
This is where Lord Rooster was born<br>
And mistakes we must never repeat</p>
<p>Find a dry place to sit, now<br>
The tale is not long the way that I tell it</p>
<p>You tell it wrong, Grandfather thinks</p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>Grandmother’s Myth</p>
<p>When your grandfather and I were young<br>
Mankind had learned to fear<br>
The curses beasts could pass to us<br>
And their knowledge we held dear</p>
<p>Lord Rat was eldest bearer of these maladies<br>
A black shape skittering through our heads<br>
The fleas he carried with him<br>
Would bite us in our beds</p>
<p>And in eight days<br>
The bells would toll<br>
Announcing you were dead</p>
<p>Lord Cow was subtle for his size<br>
The madness he carried in his flesh<br>
Would pass to those who ate him,<br>
Even when his meat was fresh</p>
<p>And in a week<br>
The brain you had<br>
Would be a runny mess</p>
<p>Lord Monkey was a tricky one<br>
Plotting from his treetop throne<br>
His curse stripped away immunity<br>
So other sicknesses could grow</p>
<p>And without fail,<br>
The tamest colds<br>
Would strike us dead in droves</p>
<p>But it was Lord Rooster we feared the most<br>
For though his wings couldn&rsquo;t take him far<br>
The little birds he consorted with<br>
Were numerous as the stars</p>
<p>And when they sang<br>
At morning’s light<br>
Lungs seized and ceased to draw</p>
<p>No one could stop the spreading death<br>
When Lord Rooster walked the earth<br>
But your grandfather defeated him<br>
How? I will start with Rooster&rsquo;s birth—</p>
<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>
<p>Grandfather interrupts</p>
<p>They were viruses, you understand?<br>
The sniffles? The coughs?</p>
<p>He tries to find a way to explain<br>
Concepts that no longer exist</p>
<p>Small creatures, living things<br>
Invisible and discrete</p>
<p>Were they ghosts? the children ask</p>
<p>No, he says<br>
Lines of code in double helix</p>
<p>Do you remember when we<br>
Grafted the peach and the plum tree?<br>
When I cut a branch from the one and Inserted it<br>
Into the other’s cleft<br>
So we would have plums out of season?</p>
<p>Viruses are like that<br>
They are the scion,<br>
We are the stock</p>
<p>They graft themselves to us<br>
And together we bear fruit</p>
<p>The children stare up at him, baffled<br>
The littlest one asks if Lord Monkey was a tree</p>
<p>Grandfather tries to think of a better metaphor,<br>
Until he sees his wife’s smile</p>
<p>He sighs<br>
Just listen to Grandmother’s story, he says</p>
<p>And walks off a ways to sit alone<br>
Staring at the rooster statues<br>
Still crowing at the dead stone globe</p>
<h2 id="v">V</h2>
<p>Ignore Grandfather, Grandmother says,</p>
<p>Look over there<br>
See where the rooster statues stand?<br>
This is where our elders sinned<br>
And gave their last command</p>
<p>They fought a war they could not win<br>
But so wicked were their ways<br>
They summoned up Lord Rooster<br>
And used him like a slave</p>
<p>They sent him to their enemies<br>
Without considering the cost<br>
For when their enemies lay dead<br>
Lord Rooster remained aloft</p>
<p>They built this shrine to summon him<br>
Trusting glass tubes to hold him in thrall<br>
Then brought their children as a sacrifice<br>
And laid them on his claws</p>
<p>Come to this place, sick spirit, they cried<br>
Voices rising above the wind<br>
Come drink your fill of our children<br>
We will pay in blood for our sin</p>
<p>Then with their knives they plunged deep<br>
And reddened water from a bloody creek<br>
Rolled down the comb and wet the beak</p>
<p>Lord Rooster was born in a droplet—<br>
A bird thing, his mind gone thin</p>
<p>The statue cracked<br>
The droplet dropped<br>
The sickness took to wing</p>
<p>And In the dying dark of night<br>
Lord Rooster began to sing</p>
<h2 id="vi">VI</h2>
<p>Grandfather clears his throat</p>
<p>They were not children we made sick<br>
He says,<br>
Embryonic stem cells never lived<br>
An egg is not a chick</p>
<p>Our work was ordained<br>
Sanctioned from on high<br>
By government officials<br>
Who wished to never die</p>
<p>They told us to open the disease<br>
We unzipped it<br>
Read nature&rsquo;s code like data decrypted</p>
<p>Rewrote its essence to be useful<br>
And implanted our lie so well<br>
The human body swore that it was truthful</p>
<p>Listen to me, my grandchildren,<br>
Lord Rooster is nothing but the name<br>
We gave it when it jumped from birds to men<br>
The statue did not awaken<br>
We are not paying for our sin</p>
<h2 id="vii">VII</h2>
<p>Grandfather’s memory is going, Grandmother says,<br>
But I remember it rightly</p>
<p>The sun rising, the fluttering wings<br>
Shedding rock and debris to reveal<br>
A skinny raw thing<br>
With its mouth open wide<br>
And to it we villagers kneeled</p>
<p>We nourished him with blood until he grew strong</p>
<p>White and crimson feathers sprouted<br>
His granite beak took a yellow hue<br>
And when we pointed him towards the east<br>
To our enemies he flew</p>
<p>The littlest grandchild asks,</p>
<p>What do these words mean, Papa<br>
In the place where Lord Rooster once perched?</p>
<p>My company’s motto, Grandfather replies<br>
Our knowledge will light the Earth</p>
<p>How did you stop him grandpa?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Lord Rooster, the child says</p>
<p>Grandfather looks away<br>
With shame in his eyes<br>
He says, I did a bad thing</p>
<p>No, Grandmother says,<br>
You saved so many lives</p>
<p>Tell the story how you wish, he says<br>
But leave me out of it</p>
<p>He turns and walks away<br>
Towards the ruined city</p>
<p>They will be safe without him<br>
On their return to the homestead<br>
A side effect of the cure:<br>
All the muggers are long dead</p>
<p>He perches himself on some rubble, brooding<br>
Mist rises from cracked streets like ghosts</p>
<p>The surest way to kill a virus<br>
Is to kill every possible host</p>
<p>Which he has done</p>
<p>It was easy and over fast<br>
Everything but the regret</p>
<p>He lapses into a long silence, thinking<br>
I am the reason there are no more birds</p>
<p>Hours later, the sun rises over a dead city</p>
<p>Nothing crows</p>
