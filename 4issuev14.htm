<div><i>Quanderpyre is reborn with a silver spoon in his future.</i>
<p class="drop">Morton Quanderpyre's emotional range was
relatively narrow, but within this confined spectrum he was well
practiced.  He had absolutely no trouble with disdain, indignation or
indifference; they were the familiar background to his daily life.
Smugness also came easily to him.  Had he not built an empire by
outsmarting others?  It had simply been a process of making the right
decisions.   He had needed to learn how to use people, to probe for
weaknesses and take advantage of them.  There had been some necessary
bypassing of rules, even from time to time a little selective bribery.
On occasion he had been obliged to hire (always at one remove) unsavoury
types who would undertake persuasion for money, no questions asked. <P>At first he had been mildly surprised at the amount of resentment and
petty envy his determined rise seemed to provoke.  After all, he told
himself, it was only natural that someone with total confidence in his
own abilities deserved to prosper.  Those who complained he either
ignored or found ways to suppress.  He grew used to not being liked,
although somewhere at the back of his mind it remained a minor
irritation, like the buzzing of a bluebottle always just out of reach.
It was not important.  What was important was the ability to exercise
power. <P>At the core of Quanderpyre's being was an emptiness continuously
yearning to be filled.  It had the same primal force, and possibly the
same origin, as an infant's need to be fed, though his memories of his
own mother were vague.  When he tried to remember her his mind clouded
with a sense of resignation and an uncertain image of a frail,
ineffectual person with watery eyes.  The image of his father was
clearer - a stocky, red-faced, rough-skinned man with a short temper,
smelling of pungent hair oil and stale beer, and who had addressed him
only as "boy", never by his name.  He did not associate his upbringing
with any displays of affection, except perhaps from the widowed aunt
(his mother's elder sister) with whom he had opted to live after his
parents' separation, rather than remain with his mother in the
ex-parental home.  His father moved to Platport, where he had been
having an affair with a salesgirl, Cloreen Bletz.   <P>Aunt Rhea had survived forty years of childless marriage to Agar, a
capable solicitor with a rather dour disposition.  Their domestic life
had been largely uneventful, tempered by the ownership of a succession
of small dogs, which served as a counter-irritant to any minor
disagreements.  Agar's legal work had occupied most of his waking hours,
and he had been content to let Rhea pursue her own harmless interest in
certain kinds of antiques and curios.   <P>Unfortunately, Aunt Rhea did not survive long after her nephew had come
to stay with her.  She had fussed and fluttered about him for a few
months like a mildly demented hen, making sure he continued to attend
school (where he had long ceased to learn anything useful), indulging
his teenage appetite with quantities of home-cooked stews, pies and
puddings, jellies and meringues.  In comparison with the bleakly
functional home he had been used to, Aunt Rhea's house was cluttered
with odd pieces of furniture, entire drawers and shelves and cabinets
full of useless ornaments.  If it were up to him, he'd get rid of the
lot, he thought to himself, when his aunt had asked him if he wouldn't
mind giving her a hand with a bit of dusting and polishing.  The
opportunity for disposal arose much sooner than he might have expected. <P>True to his nature. the young Morton exploited his aunt's kindness,
feigning an interest in her enormous collection of commemorative spoons
and other fiddly old artefacts, enduring tedious reminiscences about his
late uncle Agar's celebrated legal clients in the hope of gaining
information that might one day prove of practical benefit. <P>After a brief spell of nervous exhaustion, Aunt Rhea had simply expired.
He had returned from school one day to find her apparently asleep in an
armchair, a copy of	<i>'Ladle and Spoon Connoisseur'</i> slipped from
her grasp.  When he had failed to rouse her he had gone into the kitchen
to make himself a sandwich, then came back to stare at her, at first
with a sense of indignation, then with growing excitement and relief, as
he began to realise the advantages of independence.  Quanderpyre could
not now recall who had arranged the funeral, or even who else had
attended, there being no other close relatives apart from his separated
parents. Morton found himself to be the owner of Aunt Rhea's house. By
the terms of Rhea's will, other than a small bequest to her sister, the
rest of her savings had been left to the local dogs' home. He vainly
tried to remember what it had felt like to mourn his aunt's passing, but
all that his mind's eye could provide was a parade of gleaming spoons. <P>When he began to discover that there was potential wealth in what he had
dismissed as clutter, and even before he learned that he had
legitimately inherited the Spoonhouse (as he surreptitiously thought of
it) and its curiously specialized contents, he had used several school
exercise books to make a private inventory.  His crafty old aunt had
evidently known what she was doing; some of this ghastly junk might
actually be valuable.  While his classmates were dutifully studying for
exams, he was systematically poring over catalogues, checking auction
records and collectors' guides.  At about the time his form teacher had
said "Mark my words, Quanderpyre, you'll never amount to anything unless
you apply yourself, lad," he was getting ready to sell the family silver
to the highest bidders.  Not to mention the beaded ebony bureaux, the
satinwood chairs, the early millefiore paperweights, the engraved glass
bandicoots, the miniature vases, bodkin-cases, Baroque fans, scent
phials and the antique hand-painted ink-pot, which in itself was worth a
small fortune. <P>By the time the young entrepreneur had cleared the Spoonhouse of its
bric-a-brac, he had put aside a substantial sum which was quietly
accruing interest while he decided what to do next.  He had left school
without any significant qualifications, but he had utter confidence in
his information-gathering and marketing skills.  Within a few years, he
he had no doubt that he would lay the foundations for an enterprise that
would dominate Snoak City.  He might even start his own special
collection; of what he had not yet decided, as he had yet to find
something that appealed to him, but it would be something extraordinary,
something others would be bound to envy.  It would need more than a
house&#133;  He closed his eyes, breathed deeply, feeling his horizons expand
into a future firmly under his own control.  A pleasing idea struck him.
He would have a magnificent tower built!  It would be a bold, bright
structure, visible for miles around, overlooking the entire city.  Out
of yesterday's spoons would be born tomorrow's empire. <P><small>&copy;L.J.Sklaroff  2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
