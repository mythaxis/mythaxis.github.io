<div align=center><img src="adalet.jpg"><BR><h2>Adalet</h2><BR><h3>Jez Patterson</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>The lengths some people will go to in order to make documentary
tv interesting.</i>
<p class=drop>&#147;We&#146;d like to get some footage inside your
facility,&#148; Daphne said, leaning low in case a swollen wedge of cleavage
was going to make the difference. &#147;I believe it&#146;s named after your
grandfather?&#148; <P>&#147;Joseph Henderson, The First. Sure, we can arrange that. We&#146;re so proud
of all that Adalet is. In fact, our planet&#146;s name says it all: Justice.
That&#146;s what my grandfather and all the other pilgrims dreamed of. And
that&#146;s what we&#146;ve achieved.&#148; <P>&#147;Then that would be wonderful.&#148; Daphne leaned back so her blouse closed
again, disconcerted that Henderson had ignored it. Men you couldn&#146;t read
or manipulate were trouble, and she needed to do both right now. &#147;Shall
we say tomorrow, then?&#148; <P>&#147;Tomorrow it is. When do you hope to broadcast, by the way? We get some
of your Earth stations on Adalet. Several of your soap operas are very
popular.&#148; <P>&#147;Not until next year.
This is a documentary we&#146;re making, so it won&#146;t be on any of the
entertainment channels.&#148; Her smile was tight. <P>&#147;Never mind. I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll do a wonderful job.&#148; He patted her knee
without any sexual overtones--which just made it patronising. &#147;Until
tomorrow.&#148; <P><p class=drop>&#147;You do know there are over two hundred and twenty
colonies in the Raghavan System?&#148; her producer, Macie, felt it necessary
to remind her. &#147;Adalet just happens to be one of the few interesting
ones. Just be thankful it&#146;s not the only one, is what I&#146;m saying.&#148; <P>&#147;It&#146;s unique because of its justice system, nothing else. Doesn&#146;t
exactly make for sexy TV.&#148; <P>&#147;Why are you so tetchy about this? Religious groups, ecological
self-sufficiency, new forms of government and economy, you know the
score. It&#146;s what brought pilgrims out here and what we&#146;re here to cover.
If you don&#146;t like it, I don&#146;t know why you volunteered for this series.&#148; <P>&#147;You know exactly why, Macie: because this was all there was. Presenting
jobs aren&#146;t exactly falling from the trees.&#148; She turned away and dug her
nails into her palms to stop herself saying more. <i>Revealing</i> more.
Two hundred and twenty inhabited planets--there had to be one worth
calling home. <P>&#147;Yes, well, presenters are. So unless you want Alan to fire your arse
and replace it with some shareholder&#146;s niece, play nicely and do what
the channel tells you.&#148; <P>&#147;You&#146;re all heart, Macie.&#148; <P>&#147;I am what I am, Daphne. You should try facing the same reality. &#148; <P><p class=drop>&#147;No, we don&#146;t need any of the history - they&#146;ll run a
short montage explaining how the founders came here, their concept of a
new justice system and their early days in setting it up. What we&#146;re
here to capture is how all that theory is now operating in practice.&#148; <P>&#147;Oh, it was <i>always</i> more than just theory,&#148; Joseph Henderson told
her. &#147;My grandfather conducted studies, even had some limited success
back on Earth. Back there, they wouldn&#146;t let him go the whole way with
his vision though, which is why he needed a place like Adalet.&#148; <P>&#147;Yes.&#148; Daphne&#146;s smile had now wound so tight it puckered the corners of
her lips and had pinged out a nerve under each eye. &#147;So, if you could
give us some examples of how you deal with different crimes, then our
audience will get something of what makes Adalet so unique.&#148; <P><div class=lpullquote>&#147;They have something similar on Earth for
relaxation therapy.&#148;</div>&#147;Several of our neighbouring planets have
introduced our methods or even
asked us to come and operate their criminal justice systems. We&#146;ve
turned from pioneers to exporters. Just last month, we got a communiqu&#233;
from Earth&#133; though I&#146;m not at liberty to mention the country nor persons
concerned.&#148; <P>&#147;Mister Henderson?&#148; <P>&#147;Oh. Quite. Sorry. I can&#146;t help but get carried away when I&#146;m talking
about our successes. So, are we rolling? Is that still the right word?
Great. Shall I just explain a few of our procedures? Okay, okay. Well,
I&#146;m not sure where to start&#133;&#148; <P>&#147;Tell us what happens if someone is convicted of stealing,&#148; Daphne said. <P>&#147;They&#146;re forced to watch their belongings being given or taken away, one
at a time, over the course of a week. The recipients are anyone who
turns up at their house. Often, we set out trestle tables on the front
lawn and passers-by can just help themselves. Once word gets out, more
turn up, of course.&#148; <P>&#147;And if the crime involves violence?&#148; <P>&#147;We use a variant of the stocks. Those wooden contraptions they put
people in in Medieval times? Well, it&#146;s the psychological effect really.
It&#146;s not the pain a victim remembers from an assault, but the emotional
after-tremors. The aggressor is locked into our stocks so they&#146;re
standing upright, dressed in facility-issue shorts, with their head
fixed in a brace so they can&#146;t look up, down, to the sides. Anyone who
wants to can approach and&#133; well, it&#146;s pinches and slaps mostly because
anything greater and they&#146;d be committing an offence themselves. The
aggressor can&#146;t see it coming--but they feel it. And, more importantly,
they fear it.&#148; <P>Daphne forced out the next line from the board Macie was holding up and
jabbing with her finger. &#147;And&#133; murder?&#148; <P>&#147;Total sensory deprivation. The chambers are designed so they lie there
as good as dead. Like a conscious coma.&#148; The way Henderson said it, the
smile that accompanied it - all syrup and shine&#151; added to its horror.
Poe would have approved. <P>&#147;They have something similar on Earth for relaxation therapy,&#148; Daphne
said, as an attempt to soften the image. <P>&#147;Not like this. The nearest to this would be to be cut adrift in deep space.&#148; <P>Daphne swallowed what felt like a dry teabag. &#147;I think that&#146;s enough for
the moment.&#148; She could feel her features sag as the blood drained from
her cheeks. &#147;Are we okay, Macie?&#148; <P>&#147;Fine. We&#146;ll get some more shots around the facilities.&#148; <P>&#147;Sure.&#148; <P><p class=drop>Daphne didn&#146;t have to feign the dizzy
spell. As she flipped through her news dispatcher, she saw Alan's body
had been discovered and time of death put at the day before their
departure for Adalet, scuppering any last chance of an easy alibi and a
return to Earth. When they went through the list of visitors their boss
had received that day--which of course they would - then... <P>&#147;Madam?&#148;  <P>Daphne gasped.  <P>&#147;I&#146;m sorry, but your producer sent me to fetch you. She&#146;s waiting for
you at the Deprivation Chamber.&#148; <P>&#147;I&#146;m really not feeling too well&#133;&#148;  <P>Joseph Henderson&#146;s assistant opened his hands helplessly, shrugged, but
made no move to leave. Daphne sighed. &#147;Okay. Tell Macie I&#146;m coming.&#148; <P>&#147;I&#146;d better escort you, madam. It&#146;s quite a maze.&#148; <P>Daphne followed the assistant along a white-tiled corridor that should
have led to a basement morgue. Perfect. She attempted to take her mind
off that line of thought. &#147;Has it really been such a success - all of
this?&#148; <P>&#147;Adalet? Absolutely. We never have repeat offenders. Mind you, neither
did The Inquisition - but for other reasons.&#148; He drew a finger across
his throat and made the sound her cat used to make when it was angry.
Another wave of nausea crashed against the wall of her stomach and she
put out a hand to steady herself. <P>She tried again with the distraction technique. &#147;Do you know of anyone,
personally, who&#146;s had cause to experience a punishment?&#148; <P>&#147;Of course. All of us. Well, we have to.&#148; <P>&#147;You&#133; what?&#148; <P>&#147;To know what it&#146;s like. Didn&#146;t you know? It&#146;s not enough that the
sentence merely fits the crime. This isn&#146;t a punishment facility - it
exists as a means to remind a perpetrator of the consequences of doing
wrong. Prevention is better than punishment, and for that an
individual&#146;s got to fully appreciate what those consequences are from
the outset. Adalet believes in the practical. If you don&#146;t know what&#146;s
waiting for you, why are you ever going to avoid it?&#148; <P>She thought of Alan, his empty promises, the jobs he&#146;d passed onto his
latest squeeze that should have been hers. Had he known what was waiting
for him? <P>By the time they reached the room which housed the deprivation tanks,
her mind was made up. Macie felt obliged to sound dubious but Daphne
knew she loved it: the producer&#146;s eyes brightening even after the shock
of Alan&#146;s death. <P>&#147;Well, hey. If you&#146;re sure you want to do it, Daphne?&#148; <P>&#147;Sure I&#146;m sure.&#148; She climbed into the tank before the second thoughts
became third. It couldn&#146;t be that bad. Not when there was no pain and
just brief, dark oblivion. Sure. Just like those relaxation tanks.	Only
more so. <P>It couldn&#146;t be that bad. <P><p class=drop>It was worse. <P>It was like an intense version of those anxiety nightmares you had when
you realised you were sleeping and wanted to wake up but were paralysed
and could only wait until the terror deigned to ease its grip. <P>&#147;&#133;just you and your conscience, alone in the dark,&#148; Henderson was saying
to camera when they opened the tank up fifteen minutes later. Her face
was streaked with tears, her hair frizzed and tangled, her fingers
twisted to claws, and her body couldn&#146;t stop shivering. <P>&#147;Daphne? Are you okay?&#148; But even in her current state, Daphne could
still tell Macie was thrilled at how this would look on film. <P>&#147;It was me,&#148; she told him, the camera. &#147;I killed Alan.&#148; <P>Joseph Henderson&#146;s look was of disappointment, but not shock. Macie&#146;s
was pure confusion. <P>&#147;Ahh. That is its other effect,&#148; Henderson said with a sigh. &#147;Sometimes,
I rather think we should rename it &#145;The Confessional&#146;. Everyone who&#146;s
ever lain in there finds their conscience pricked into admitting their
crimes. Some from years back - things they&#146;ve had weighing on them all
this time.&#148; <P>Daphne saw Macie edge away from her and the tank. Probably wondering
which she should fear most. Daphne didn&#146;t care. Everyone carried baggage
off Earth. <P> <small>&copy;Jez Patterson 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
