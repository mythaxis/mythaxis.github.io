<div><i>Be very careful where you tread!</i>
<p class=drop>A starburst of globubbles signalled the
start of the annual contest in Snoak City&#146;s westernmost district of
Whissit Fields.   In the warm dusk the bright globes hung like a slowly
expanding cluster of floating jewels, casting a network of overlapping
colours over this year&#146;s untested challenge that was Foroquont&#146;s
maze.</P>
<P>High above the maze&#146;s central core, an invisibly tethered pod, its
underside a non-reflective black, beamed images of the selected
contestants as they each made their way through the four separate
entrance locks.  Spim Foroquont had incorporated a range of unexpected
design features into the fabric of the maze.  Although substantially
organic, in the ancient tradition of  impenetrable hedges, some sections
contained traps for the unwary, such as soft mirrors, opaque
cloud-curtains, sensor-triggered barriers and disorienting white noise
areas.</P>
<P>At the northern entrance Garsel Vence had already followed the narrow
spiral path for thirty metres before suddenly faltering in front of a
solid block of hedge.  He retraced a dozen steps. Out of the corner of
his eye he was almost sure he had belatedly registered something
different about the texture of the hedge on his right.  He ran a gloved
hand along the smoothly-trimmed, densely textured leaves.  Nothing.  The
light from the globubbles confused his colour perception, but was bright
enough to obviate the use of his torch.  He removed the glove, closed
his eyes, and moved his fingertips across the same section.  Ah, there!
Although the leaves appeared to be identical, here their texture was
subtly different, slightly drier, artificial.   Pulling on the glove
again he used both hands to apply pressure systematically to this
section, and was rewarded when it responded by pivoting like a revolving
door, allowing him access to a parallel path.</P>
<P>Almost a thousand metres to the south, Taera Cassorian was making
faster progress, having avoided two cul-de-sacs and a right-hand fork
which would have returned her to her starting point.  However, she was
now confronted by a choice of two open leftward-curving paths and a
disconcertingly dark patch of roiling fog.   Unclipping the torch from
her belt, she aimed the powerful beam directly into the obstructive
cloud.  It failed to penetrate far enough to give any indication of its
depth.  She shrugged her shoulders, took a deep breath, and plunged
through.  After a few steps she ran blindly straight into another hedge.
The shock almost caused her to turn back, but she forced herself to stay
calm, got down on hands and knees and felt her way down the hedge to its
foot.  There was a gap at the base, which was just large enough for her
to slide through to the other side, where an unobstructed path again
presented her with a choice of whether to turn right or left.  She chose
left, which led her to a series of sharp turns in both directions.
After ten minutes she realised she had lost her torch.</P>
<P>Jaunx Rimhill stood for a moment at the eastern entrance staring up
at the globubbles.  He was grateful for their multicoloured brightness,
which he knew would persist for eight hours or more, but they could not
be relied upon for orientation.  Although the air was relatively still,
every slight current changed their configuration, and already a few of
the outermost had drifted out of sight above the hedge-tops.  Once
inside the maze his normally acute sense of direction soon deserted him.
A dead end obliged him to retreat through a gap on his left that he had
been reluctant to take, and within a few minutes he was uncomfortably
convinced that he was going the wrong way.  At every turn the view was
frustratingly similar, and as he peered ahead he began to worry whether
his vision was beginning to play tricks.  In the distance he saw a
figure approaching him, which he knew was highly improbable, as none of
the other three could possibly have covered that amount of ground in so
short a time.  Who the hell could it be?  No-one else was allowed in the
maze except in emergencies.  They both reached for their torches
simultaneously.  As the two beams met with a fierce glare, Jaunx laughed
with relief at his own image.  There was no other detectable opening, so
he stepped through the soft mirror, and had to put his hands to his ears
at the hissing roar that assaulted him from every side.  The silvered
nanogel sealed silently behind him.</P>
<P>When she was a little younger, Eris Sipsel sometimes used to play
chase-the-lizard with her elder sisters.  She couldn&#146;t have known then
that the game would be invaluable training for a potential maze
contestant.  Her agile manoeuvres through the early stages were
spectacular.  She was fast, confident, graceful, seemingly undaunted by
the difficulty of the task.  The aerial view from the pod revealed that
in less than ten minutes Eris had successfully negotiated the five outer
concentric passages before encountering any of Foroquont&#146;s concealed
traps.  Underfoot the paths were composed throughout of a stiff but
resilient water-repellent aerofoam material.  In natural light it was a
pale greyish-green, but the globubbles mottled its surface with rainbow
patches and shadows.  Eris was enjoying the ease with which the springy
surface allowed her to  run until one incautious step triggered the two
devices which suddenly blocked both her forward progress and the chance
to retreat.  Above her two globubbles, amber and emerald, hung in a
square of darkness, roofing the claustrophobic space from which there
seemed to be no escape.</P>
<P>Garsel Vence was wondering whether a primitive magnetic compass would
have been of any help. It would certainly have kept him heading roughly
south, despite the many diversions, but would have offered no guarantee
of reaching the path that led to the vital centre.  As it was, their
equipment was strictly limited to flexisuits, gloves, torch, waterflask,
nutritabs, basic first-aid dressings and the small cylindrical emergency
alarm which contained a static flare; no tools or navigational
instruments, not even a watch.  Basically, it was a question of trying
to stay alert, avoiding obvious pitfalls, and trusting largely to luck.
Knowing only that the diameter of the maze was about one kilometre, and
judging from the apparent thickness of the hedge and the uniform width
of the paths, he had tried to estimate the number of concentric paths he
would have to cross before hopefully reaching the centre.  The
discouraging total amounted to more than three hundred.  So far he had
managed only seventeen, recording the tally with some difficulty by
making marks with a thumbnail on the side of his waterflask.  His
initial enthusiasm had already worn off, but determination was among his
strongest assets.</P>
<P>Taera Cassorian tried hard not to panic on discovering the loss of
her torch, cursing her stupidity for not having clipped it on securely.
At least she could still see, although she knew that in time the
globubbles would dissipate  She had to decide whether she could risk
going on without it, or waste valuable time looking for it.  On balance,
she realised it was too useful to be without, and unwillingly turned
back, struggling to remember where exactly were the turns she had made
since she had crawled away from the fog.  It took her almost an hour to
find the small area of blackness at the foot of the hedge, where she
groped cautiously until her fingers finally encountered the familiar
shape.  She almost cried with relief at her minor triumph, feeling
momentarily as if she had performed a successful conjurer&#146;s trick.  In
her mind&#146;s ear she heard the accompanying drum-roll and clash of
cymbals.  Allowing herself a nutritab and a sip of water she set off
again with a sense of renewed energy.</P>
<P>Jaunx found himself sitting on the path with his back resting against
the hedge. There was a faint buzzing in his head, and he felt slightly
giddy.  Far away he thought he could hear a low muttering.  He noticed
his torch on the ground beside him, and automatically clipped it back
on, idly wondering why he was sitting down.  Gradually his head cleared
and some memories returned: the approaching figure, glaring light,
entering the mirror&#133;  He frowned, unsure of what had happened next, or
which way he had been heading.  Getting to his feet he glanced behind
him, and without unclipping the torch he swept its beam along the hedge.
No sign of a mirror, just the parallel curving of the high dark walls.
He shook his head and turned right, searching for the next gap.</P>
<P>Eris fought back tears of frustration. She had examined everything
she could reach, peering and prodding at the surrounding hedge walls and
hopping on every point of the square she was confined to in an attempt
to locate a trigger spot.  She growled with irritation, and fancied she
heard a deeper echoing growl in the far distance.  She began to have an
irrational fear that the mechanism might have jammed in the locked
position, which meant that she would have to use her alarm flare.
Defeatist thinking.  She considered the alternatives.  Either her
examination had been too hasty, and she had overlooked something, or&#133;
Or what?  She couldn&#146;t think of anything else.  She had been stuck here
for so long that the emerald globubble was no longer visible.  Whith a
cry of exasperation she reached for her torch and began her meticulous
examination for the third time.  Abruptly, with a rush of air and a
scattering of tiny leaves, there occurred the alternative she had not
considered; the release mechanism was time-delayed, and she was free to
move on.</P>
<P>Thousands of Snoak City viewers, and many more further afield were
watching the contest live, prepared as ever to match the contestants&#146;
endurance with their own less demanding variety.  A team of commentators
was on hand to supply background details on the selection process,
statistics from past contests, Spim Foroquont&#146;s credentials, the
contestants&#146; occupations, achievements and interests.  In the event of
prolonged inactivity or an unforeseen hiatus there was readily available
back-up material in the form of recorded interviews with their friends
and relatives, teachers and former participants.  Bets were permitted to
be placed on the likely winner for the first three hours only, with all
proceeds to the Snoak City Outdoor Festival Fund.  Inevitably, odds kept
shifting until the last allowable moment.  Only after the three-hour
period was an overview of the entire maze screened, so that it was now
possible to compare in real time the four contestants&#146; actual progress.
From time to time the focus shifted to give a slow panoramic view over
Snoak City, from the dimly lit suburbs, across the weaving trails of
traffic and the changing geometries of light from tall office blocks,
the illuminated fountain in Sparagulan College Square, the dark expanse
of parkland, the necklaces of light across the river, to the flickering
clouds looming distantly above the sea.</P>
<P>All the contestants had noticed the unexpected change in the movement
of the globubbles; they were being carried higher and faster, all in the
same direction.  There was no appreciable change in temperature, but the
sky had become darker, now requiring their total dependence on torches.
In confirmation of the increase in wind speed, small gusts began to
buffet the hedges, channelling their energy through the narrow
passageways.  There was a distinct intermittent rumbling.</P>
<P>From above the sensitive cameras in the pod showed that Garsel Vence
was now clearly in the lead, having traversed more than half the
distance to the centre, but those watching could see the difficulty that
lay ahead of him.  Garsel had abandoned the discipline of making
tally-marks on his waterflask when he had reached a hundred.  He
reasoned that it was time-consuming, and that in any case he could trust
his memory, which told him that the path on which he had just emerged
was the two hundred and sixth from the perimeter.  His torch revealed an
obstruction to his left which a practiced test suggested was not going
to budge.  Moving to his right the torch beam whitened, encountering
light-scattering particles where the air was steadily being thickened;
the increasing gusts had disrupted a cloud-curtain, which was spreading
its opacity well beyond its source.  With the globubbles gone, and the
torch barely of use, the next part of his course was going to depend
almost entirely on touch.  For an instant, the sky lightened, revealing
a possible gap just beyond the swirling mist.  Seconds later there was a
reverberating boom.</P>
<P>Taera was now obsessively protective about her torch, and kept
touching her belt to ensure it was still secured, using it sparingly
while there was still ambient light.  She had no idea how far she had
progressed, but had chosen to bypass a soft mirror, thereby avoiding a
trap, and had gained time by slipping diagonally through two successive
concealed openings before the last globubbles drifted away.  She became
aware that fitful eddies of wind were sweeping between the hedges, and
pulled the hood of her flexisuit over her head to stop hair getting in
her eyes.  Luckily this action afforded some protection against the
barrage of white noise which suddenly assailed her in what had seemed an
innocuous clearing around a central pillar of hedge.  It was obviously
from this pillar that the deafening noise was emanating.  Defensively,
Taera flung herself to the ground, and the noise abated.  Clutching her
torch, she inched forward awkwardly until she had passed the pillar, and
tentatively propped herself up, then slowly rose to her feet.
Thankfully, the sound had stopped.  She awarded herself a nutritab, and
had taken only a few more steps when a bright flash lit the sky, soon
followed by an air-trembling roar.</P>
<P>Thunder didn&#146;t bother Jaunx Rimhill. He had spent two years logging
on the slopes of Mount Kyren, where for a whole season the constantly
rising cumulus was riven by jagged sparks whose sharp cracks rebounded
for hours across the valley.  Admittedly, it was the last thing he
expected here in Whissit Fields, especially during the contest, but the
sound had the effect of spurring him on, despite the growing tiredness
in his legs.  He turned another corner, aligning his sight along the
torch beam, watching out for any sign that might betray another of
Foroquont&#146;s nasty surprises.  Sure enough, some five metres in front of
him the air looked dangerously smoky, and he knew he would have to trace
the source before being able to advance.</P>
<P>The co-ordinator, Pedrek Ens was becoming seriously concerned. He had
been assured by the forecasters at Central that although there could be
some precipitation tomorrow, the chances of local rain were extremely
slight for the duration of the contest.  He knew that meteorology was
not an exact science, but dammit, this approaching storm could ruin the
event.  For the previous eighteen years globubbles had always dutifully
stayed more or less in place, and Mazes had remained wind-free and dry.
He didn&#146;t need this uncontrollable element of drama in what was supposed
to be a straightforward elimination contest, although the media people
seemed to be revelling in it.  The pitch of the commentators&#146; voices was
rising unhealthily, and he was tempted to tell them all to calm down.
Nevertheless he made sure his technicians were monitoring their grids,
ready to alert the emergency rescue service if necessary.</P>
<P>Anyone close enough to hear what Eris Sipsel was chanting under her
breath as she jogged and sprang between hedges might have been forgiven
for thinking her grip on reality was slipping.  Her subvocal refrain was
&quot;Chase the lizard!  Chase the lizard!&quot;.  It seemed to be
boosting her morale.  The truth was, she had never quite overcome a
childhood aversion to thunder, and was trying to obliterate the fear
with happier memories. The last dazzling flash and nerve-jangling clap
had been practically overhead, heralding a few heavy drops followed by a
hard vertical torrent from which the hedges offered no shelter.  Eris
pulled the hood down over her eyes, and struggled on.  </P>
<P>It had now been more than five hours since the contestants had first
entered the maze, and their exhaustion was apparent, even from the
aerial overview.  All of them were well past the half-way point when the
storm broke, but it was obvious that their progress was now severely
impeded.  At ground level the heavy rain bounced off the paths and
filtered through the hedges, to form rivulets which would have
threatened the integrity of their root system, had not Foroquont&#146;s
engineers installed effective drainage, anticipating the contingency of
extreme weather conditions.  Even so, Garsel, Taera, Jaunx and Eris were
all moving with difficulty.  Along with the viewing public and the media
team, Pedrek Ens waited anxiously for the first emergency flare to be
fired.</P>
<P>At the centre of the maze there was no gaudy extravagance, no
welcoming committee of local dignitaries &#150; for the competitors all that
was irrelevant; it was the satisfaction of completing the event that
counted.  The selection procedure eliminated those interested only in
material gain.  There was a simple softly-lit circular construction with
a translucent domed roof and an unlocked door.  Its principal contents
were toilet facilities, a changing room with fresh clothing, comfortable
seats, a cabinet stocked with light refreshments, and a table with an
illuminated button for the winner to press.  </P>
<P>The storm passed, and above, outlining the dark mass of the pod, a
few stars became visible, lending their glimmering assistance to the
final push for the centre.  With compassionate restraint, Foroquont had
chosen not to incorporate traps other than dead-ends in the last dozen
concentric paths.  Now that the wind and rain had ceased, the only
sounds to be heard in the maze were those made by the contestants
themselves.  Elsewhere, throughout Snoak City and beyond, in the studio
and the co-ordination room, there were noisy shouts of encouragement and
a degree of tension and mounting excitement which the contest had not
generated for many years.  All four contestants had justifed their
success in the pre-maze tests, and proved their own extraordinary
stamina by reaching the last section within minutes of each other.
Garsel was quite sure he had heard footsteps behind him on the adjoining
path.  Both Taera and Jaunx heard somewhere nearby echoes of their own
panting breath, and knew they must be close to their goal.  Only Eris
was unaware of the others&#146; proximity, as she was still chanting </P>
<I><P>&quot;Chase&#133;&quot;</I> </P>
<P>up to the point where the hedge abruptly ended, and miraculously,
there was a door, and inside, a table, </P>
<I><P> &quot;the&#133;&quot;</I> </P>
<P>and on it, as she stumbled joyfully forward, stretching out her hand,
hoping her legs wouldn&#146;t give way, a glowing button.</P>
<I><P> &quot;LIZARD!&quot;</P>
