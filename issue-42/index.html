    <p>It&#39;s always a challenge to finalize each issue of Mythaxis. I try to present a table of contents with a deliberate structure, to place stories in relation to each other in a way that satisfies my editorial OCD (even if our readers remain blissfully oblivious to any such efforts going on behind the scenes). Usually picking a lead story is easy, though, since that&#39;s a different problem. The first one has to stand alone, it&#39;s the first thing the reader sees, after all – but this time that&#39;s not exactly the case. For while Sean MacKendrick&#39;s timely and sinister duologue absolutely works on the page, wait until you get a load of the audio play…</p>

    <p>The Sauútiverse is a science-fantasy shared world project set in a binary star system whose civilisation is rooted deeply in the mythologies, languages, and cultures of Africa and features an intricate magic system based on sound, oral traditions, and music. I&#39;m delighted to present Cheryl Ntumy&#39;s latest, and most emblematic contribution to that cannon – you see, the name Sauúti is taken from the Swahili word for &#39;voice&#39;, and if there&#39;s one thing this story is about… well, if there&#39;s maybe two things…</p>

    <p>One of my all-time editorial bugbears is writers writing stories about someone being a writer – sets my teeth right on edge, I&#39;d sooner chew a mouthful of tin foil than read such a thing. However, for no reason that I can consciously explain, I absolutely adore speculative fiction about employment… I guess being a writer just can&#39;t be a proper job. Anyway, while the short genre fiction community sharpens its pitchfork collection, let&#39;s celebrate the fact that Anna Ziegelhof delivered the right kind of story.</p>

    <p>Before you read on, a quick shout out to SFFWorld.com, within whose supportive community forum your editor cut his teeth as a short fiction writer, sharing work and gaining feedback. I didn&#39;t mention it in our last issue, but I encountered Helen French&#39;s flash fiction Safe in the Dark right there, and enjoyed it so much I asked to take it for Mythaxis more or less on the spot – and so too this great piece of possibly prescient sci-fi by Travis Ezell, who really brings it all bittersweet home in the closing words.</p>

    <p>You&#39;ll have to bear with me here, and forgive me for the confusion, but one of my all-time favourite films is John Carpenter&#39;s THE THING. And if you told me Charlie Winter&#39;s gentle, warm-hearted yarn is surely as far removed as anything could be from that, so too the strange beasts that come to populate it, I&#39;d largely agree. Yet both look at men living in isolation, their world devoid of women, which is interesting. And, in this case, also lovely.</p>

    <p>Mythaxis is a home to all the speculative genres, though I feel that horror is the hardest sell, despite for many years being my first choice in recreational reading. And I mention this because what Josh Pearce is giving you here, it&#39;s very definitely sci-fi. But, as is proven by more than one story in our archives, sci-fi isn&#39;t always for the faint at heart. Fair warning, this story has edges.</p>

    <p>And speaking of that darkest of genres, possibly, let us turn now to Japan&#39;s latest contribution to horror— well, or perhaps it&#39;s the uncanny… the unsettling? The absurd? I&#39;m not sure I can say. Come to that, I&#39;m not even sure how confident horror reviewer extraordinaire Bill Ryan is with regard to the case at hand, and that alone should be enough to send a shiver up your spine.</p>

    <p>On with the downward spiral of the world – and Mythaxis can&#39;t be expected to distract you from it alone, coddling you into a desperately clung-to moment of &#39;Oh how interesting, no need to look around and witness the collapse of all Humanity touches.&#39; For indeed, there are other places online you can read well at the click of a button. At least until the power goes out for the final time…</p>
