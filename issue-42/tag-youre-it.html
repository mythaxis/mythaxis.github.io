<p>“Title album Harrison European Vacation Highlights.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&lsquo;Harrison European Vacation Highlights&rsquo; album has been created! Would you like to enable auto-descriptions?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Yes. Keep descriptions short to medium in length.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>OK, please select a photo to get started.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Start at the top. First image in the list.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Westminster Bridge.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: London Eye, River Thames.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: This picture was taken from Westminster Bridge just after sunrise. The giant wheel of the London Eye shines in the early morning light. A small crowd is present, people wearing coats in the cool atmosphere of one of London’s most famous sites. The River Thames glitters in the lower left corner of the photo.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Great. Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Westminster Bridge.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: London Eye, River Thames.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: This selfie was taken from Westminster Bridge just after sunrise. Two smiling figures are the primary focus of the photo. They appear to be in their mid-thirties. They are wearing matching wool hats. The man is wearing thick lensed glasses which have fogged. Behind them the cityscape of London, England warms in the early morning. The London Eye can be seen to the right of the happy couple. Three real boats make their way up and down the river.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Tag man as Lance Harrison.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The man has been identified as ‘Lance Harrison’. All photos of Lance Harrison will now be tagged accordingly.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Tag woman as Janet Harrison.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Westminster.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Westminster Abbey.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: The beautiful Gothic spires of Westminster Abbey reach into the sky. The fish-eye aspect of the building in this picture gives the structure an ellipsoidal appearance. Statues frame the bottom of the picture. Dark gray clouds create a dramatic cap for the photo.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Westminster.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Palace of Westminster, Elizabeth Tower.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison stand in front of the Palace of Westminster. A fortyish man and a woman in her late forties have joined them; all four stand with their arms around the others. The clock at the top of Elizabeth Tower displays the time as 8:51 AM. A classic London black cab is parked near the hugging couple. A fake replica of a gray car sits behind the black cab.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“No, that is a real car in the photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! The car has been removed from the description.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Tag other couple in the group as Maria Harrison and Nicolas Arnaud.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The couple have been identified as ‘Maria Harrison’ and ‘Nicolas Arnaud’. All photos with either individual will now be tagged accordingly.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Okay, next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Westminster.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Buckingham Palace.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: The closed front palace gate takes up most of the view, framing the center of the palace through the black and gold bars of the gate. The weather has worsened, with dark clouds looming in the background.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison sit at a table inside a café or restaurant. They sit close to one another; Janet kisses Lance’s cheek. Three other people are visible in the unknown location. A window behind them is streaked with heavy rain.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Tag location as Cafe Mahan.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The location has been added to the photo’s description.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Ah… count the people in the photo again.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There are five people visible. Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison sit at one table. Three unknown people sit at other tables.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe the people, please.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two middle aged women sit at a table to the left of Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison. One woman has curly white hair and is wearing a transparent raincoat. She is holding a large porcelain cup in both hands and is enjoying its warmth. The second woman is frowning at a phone she is holding up to her face. A young man of about twenty in a green apron is standing behind the counter with his arms crossed. He appears to be watching the rain.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe the man standing at the back of the room.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No man standing at the back of the room can be identified.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe man in upper left of photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No man can be identified in the upper left of the photo.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe… figure standing near the window at the back of the room who is facing left and wearing a big hat.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A human-shaped mass of flesh-colored bits waits near a glass case of pastries in a darkened corner of the coffee shop. The shape is wearing a wide brimmed hat similar in style to an outback hat and a long draping coat. The shape’s head is tilted down toward the pastries.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“No, that is a man. He’s just in a dark place in the room.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! Description has been updated.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 1st, 2023, morning.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: London, England, Cafe Mahan</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Janet Harrison sits at an inside table with Maria Harrison and Nicolas Arnaud. Janet holds up a black T-shirt with a red circle and the words “MIND THE GAP”. The shirt has made her laugh. Two middle aged women are sitting at a nearby table, each looking at a phone. A young man is taking the order of a woman who is holding an umbrella. Her wet clothing suggests she has just entered the building. An ageless man-shaped figure is standing near a glass case which is half filled with pastries and half filled with fake replicas of scones. Heavy rain darkens a large window to the right of the photo.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“That is the same man as before. That is a normal man. Those were real scones.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! I will identify the figure as a normal man going forward. The description of the pastry case has been updated.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Go to the next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 3rd, 2023.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Heathrow Airport, London, England.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison sit near an airport gate. In this selfie, Janet looks at the camera with a smile on her face. Lance is sleeping, with his head resting on Janet’s shoulder. Lance’s mouth is open.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 4th, 2023, mid-day.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France, Ile de Cite.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Notre Dame cathedral.</em></p>
<p><em>Description: A large crowd gathers in front of Notre Dame’s west facade, which towers behind them and dominates the composition of the picture. The sky is cloudless and bright blue. Many people in the crowd are blurred, apparently in motion when the picture was taken. Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison stand in the middle, smiling at the camera. Maria Harrison is nearby, perusing a fake souvenir cart. A normal man in a large hat and long coat stands behind her. A small rip of blackness is open near the normal man’s hand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe the normal man – is that the same man from London?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man is the same figure previously identified. The figure’s face is more visible in the open light and can now be seen as comprised of flesh-colored insects which have formed themselves into the shape of a human male. The insects do not appear to be of any known species. Their tiny faces seem to be screaming.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“No. Stop it. That man is not made of insects. The picture is fuzzy and people are out of focus, that all it is.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! Description has been updated.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Fucking AIs, man… Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 4th, 2023, mid-day.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France, Ile de Cite.</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Pont Neuf, Seine River, Statue of Henry IV.</em></p>
<p><em>Description : A large bronze statue of Henry IV astride his magnificent steed stands on a marble base above the crowd of pedestrians entering and exiting the Pont Neuf bridge. A child points at a normal man in a large hat and coat as the child’s mother pulls the child on their way. The normal man is gesturing towards the camera.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 5th, 2023, mid-day.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison, Janet Harrison, Maria Harrison, and Nicolas Arnaud enjoy a meal at an outdoor café. They are seated near a metal heater, which is glowing orange as it comforts the café’s clientele.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe man.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Which man would you like described?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Describe man in window.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man in a large hat and coat peers out of the café’s window. Dark spots hover near his hands.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“I— Next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 5th, 2023, mid-day.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison, Janet Harrison, Maria Harrison, and Nicolas Arnaud enjoy a meal seated on a café’s patio. A waiter has joined them and smiles at the camera for a group photo. Lance is holding up a glass of beer, as if to say, Cheers!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“The man in the window, what’s he doing?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man inside the café is placing tiny chairs into a dark rip near his hands. To the left and right of the normal man are fake replicas of tables and chairs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“They’re not fake! Why do you think they’re fake?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The tables and chairs to the left and right of the normal man appear to be convincing forgeries of real café furniture. However, they do not present clear shadows in the afternoon light, and their proportions suggest an illustration drawn slightly off center rather than a three-dimensional structure.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Next, next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 6th, 2023, mid-day.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Arc de Triomphe (fake)</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison smile in a selfie during a beautiful sunset. A convincing replica of the Arc de Triomphe looms over the cars circling the phony edifice. Streetlamps are lit, enhancing the color of the Parisian city.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Not… that’s not a replica, it’s real. I saw the Arc myself.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! The description has been updated.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“What about the man?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Where’s the man, find man.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Find the man! Is the normal man in the picture? Find man!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man in the large hat and long coat stands next to the not fake Arc de Triomphe, touching it with his right hand. Both his hand and the not fake Arc de Triomphe are darkened and less distinct than the surrounding details visible in the photo. His left hand holds a tiny real Arc de Triomphe. His shifting face that is not made up of insects is pointed towards Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Why does he keep reaching into rips, what’s he doing?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Is he taking things out or putting them into somewhere?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“It— What— n-next… next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 7th, 2023, evening.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Eiffel Tower, Jardin du Tuileries</em></p>
<p><em>Description: Lance Harrison and Janet Harrison hold hands, and Maria Harrison and Nicolas Arnaud exchange a kiss, in the middle of the Jardin du Tuileries. Fake bare trees line the left and right sides of the landscape. The majestic Eiffel Tower thrusts upward in the background. A normal man with a wide hat stands at the edge of the photo and reaches towards the happy couples. The air near his outstretched hands has warped and is dimmer than the surrounding evening light.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“The next photo.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Date: November 7th, 2023, night.</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Paris, France</em></p>
<p><em>Prominent Landmarks: Eiffel Tower</em></p>
<p><em>Description: The Eiffel Tower sparkles with a thousand lights, to the delight of the chilled crowds below. Lance Harrison hugs a replica of Maria Harrison in a selfie taken from below the glowing tower. Janet Harrison looks up at the lights.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“No, no, not – that’s Maria.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>”That is Maria, tag her as real Maria.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My mistake! I have updated the replica’s description as Real Maria Harrison.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Please…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Where is the normal man, where is normal man?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man in a large hat and draping coat can be seen in the crowd standing next to several fake pedestrians. He is tucking a weeping doll-sized woman into a pocket of darkness.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Is he looking at me? What is he doing?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The normal man’s face that is not made of insects seems to be pointed towards Lance Harrison, although the transient nature of the normal man’s face and lack of eyes makes it difficult to be certain. He is gesturing toward the camera.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Where is he taking them, where did he take Maria?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“What happens if he takes me? How can I stop him?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Is he here now?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m sorry, please authenticate to access this application.</em></p></blockquote>
