<div><i>Cold climate and no oxygen. A remedy for overcrowding?<P></i>
<p class=drop>You could count on the fingers of three
hands - well, four, certainly - the number of people who actually lived
in the valley. Now and again in summer, you'd see a climbing party, a
few fit young men, sometimes women, from the first world, accompanied by
a score of third-world porters, and for a week or two the valley's
population would be more than doubled. <P><div class=pullquote>He detonated a few small explosive
charges.</div>Occasionally, a Nepalese government official called
Ashwali and his
sturdy apparatchiks would dutifully struggle the forty kilometres of
steep footpath from what passed for the nearest outpost of civilisation,
his purpose, apparently, to assert Nepal's ownership of the area.
Theoretically, the valley was also claimed by Tibet, but Tibet sent no
officials, as no route into the valley existed from the north, unless
you counted the laborious and temporary steps hacked in the high sheet
ice from time to time by the climbers' ice axes. <P>On maps, the valley had no name. It was just a crease in the edge of the
Himalayas. In the local tongue, it was traditionally called a phrase
meaning approximately "Flower of the Sun". Though it was uniquely benign
for its situation, it was not the comfortable environment implied by its
name. The cold of its 5000 metre altitude, the constant wind, the
relative shortage of oxygen and the lack of infrastructure saw to that.
But for a few, it provided a welcome alternative to living cheek by jowl
with the billions of human beings who infested all the more hospitable
corners of planet Earth in the late twenty-first century. And whenever
the sun shone, it tended to warm the whole area, winter and summer, and
snow melted quickly, except in shaded corners along the ragged southern
cliffs. <P>The valley was actually a tilted bowl, so that to enter it by the usual
method from the south, you had to climb up and over the lowest rim of
the bowl, to find the valley spread out below you. At some point in the
past, the valley had been completely filled by a lake. The lake had been
supplied from the melt waters above, and it had overflowed the southern
edge of the bowl, carving a watercourse that was now dry and formed the
main route into the valley. Some millennia ago, however, water had found
its way through a crack in the base of the bowl and drained away
through subterranean caves, to emerge through a fissure miles down the
track to Kathmandu When the lake emptied, it left a rich topsoil of
silt, in which grass and vegetables grew well. The crack was called "The
Throat of Shiva". The river now ran across the valley, and disappeared
down the Throat. The Throat was quite wide at the top, but it narrowed
about twenty metres down. When the river was at its lowest volume, a
climber could safely descend to see the flow gurgling through a 
circular hole a couple of metres in diameter. The hole was not wide
enough, though, because at the height of the springtime thaw, the volume
of glacial melt water backed up to form a pale blue lake some three to
five hundred metres in diameter, and a dangerous-looking whirlpool
appeared in the lake above the Throat. The houses that constituted the
village were situated a few kilometres upstream. Although the river
bisected the valley in a diagonal from northwest to southeast, part of
it near the village ran in a narrow gorge, and an ancient Bailey bridge,
dating from some military venture in the more than a century ago, joined
the halves of the valley.
 
<p class="drop">The appearance of a lean, tanned American walker with a
rucksack full of mysterious equipment and a command of various local
languages was not at first regarded as particularly remarkable. The area
was not unknown to naturalists and documentary film makers, due to its
unique ecosystem. The American based himself at Mona's inn, but often
camped in corners remote from the inn. His name, according to Mona, was
Frank. <P>Strangely, Frank spent several weeks hiking around the whole valley,
from the green lower slopes and pastures to the windswept crags, and
along every metre of the ice-melt river from its entry, high on the
mountainside, to its exit through the Throat near the southern raised
rim. He was observed to tinker with his shining apparatus and to inspect
rocks. He detonated a few small explosive charges. He sometimes talked
on his satellite telephone. He showed no immediate sign of leaving, but
declined to reveal his mission, and he became a fascinating puzzle to
everyone except Eric. <P>It wasn't that Eric knew what the American was up to. It was just that
he didn't at first find him fascinating. He seemed to know what Frank
was doing. Eric, a sun-dried, wiry Australian, had his own preoccupation
with his wind farm. Eric's first project, six or seven years ago, when
he had first retreated here from the unbearable overcrowding, water
shortage and stark dry heat of Western Australia, was to supply the
village with running water. It had been a simple piping job from the
engineering point of view, and saved everyone the tricky, and often
hazardous, business of fetching water from the river in buckets. Getting
the supplies of piping and valves had been more difficult, and he had to
persuade Vinod and his train of sure-footed donkeys to add the materials
to his load from the nearest town. <P>The water project was followed by a largely unsuccessful, or, rather,
strictly seasonal, solar heating project assembled from plastic tubing.
Since then, it had become his self-imposed mission to provide
electricity for the cluster of homes in the village. His windmills were
mounted on rock cairns along the highest part of the southern crags.
They consisted of old motor car generators with vanes attached. There
were billions of cars in the world when commercially available fuel
became too rare and expensive to be practical. Most of the cars were
still around, used as shelters, chicken coops, storage facilities, and
so on. None of them needed their alternators any more, so
alternators weren't hard to get hold of, even in Nepal. Eric's
experiments with rigid propellers on his first dynamo proved that when
wind varied between storm force and hurricane force, which it frequently
did up here, a rigid structure would bend or blow over. Now he used
plastic tubing for the ribs of the vanes, with triangular sheets of
synthetic fabric as the sails, whose pitch and size he could vary by a
clever arrangement of rope tethers. They resembled the traditional Greek
windmill. The ribs flexed in high winds, reducing the sail area and
relieving pressure. In extremis, if a rope gave way or a sail tore, all
the other tethers on the windmill would let go without damaging the
machinery. Now that he had more than a dozen windmills, however, it was
a near full-time job to service them all when the winds were high. There
was seldom a time when the air on the ridge was still, so power cuts
were rare. His main problem had been cable from the generators to the
village, until Vinod returned from a trip down the pass with a couple of
reels of Vietnamese electric cable that didn't meet even the lowest
quality standard permitted by the Nepalese hydroelectric company, but
which was super-adequate for Eric's purposes. A few heavy accumulators,
a box of Argentinian electronic dc-ac voltage boosters and Eric was
supplying 240 volts AC to his customers. As with most things in the
village, most commerce was based on barter, favour and obligation. In
Eric's words: "No-one eats idle bread". <P>The fertile valley had always supported many more sheep and goats than
were necessary for the valley's population. In these days, when most of
the world lived on vat-grown yeast products, real meat had become a
valuable commodity. Meat was the valley's main product, and its main
employer. Driving the animals to market had proved inefficient, because
they tended to become emaciated or to die of exhaustion or to meet with
accidents on the rocky path to civilisation. An attempt to bring a yak
to the valley failed when it proved unable to get through an extended
narrow defile on the path. For some years now, Vinod's donkey caravan
had taken sheep and goat carcasses to the market in the nearest town and
returned with fuel, sometimes wood, but more usually expensive biofuel,
along with flour and other dry goods. The lack of trees, and, therefore,
fuel, in the valley accounted for the fact that it had not historically
supported a large population. <P>Now, with electricity available, the need for calorific fuel was much
reduced, and there was capacity on the returning donkey train for Eric's
electrical supplies and for the villagers' modest electrical appliances.
According to Mona, Frank the American was surprised and pleased to be
able to recharge the batteries for his equipment at the inn. <P>When Eric was forced by Mona to speculate on  Frank's activities, all he
said was "Sounds like oil prospectin' to me. No oil up here, though.
He's wastin' his time. Oil's so valuable they'll try anywhere." Eric was
wrong, as it turned out. <P>It was, of course, Mona who found out what Frank the American was really
up to. It started quietly enough when she entertained him to a mutton
stew dinner washed down with potato wine that she made from the potatoes
she grew in the vegetable garden nearby. When Eric had first tasted the
wine, he had remarked that in his opinion, it "didn't travel", but Frank
seemed to enjoy it. Mona, who purported to be German, was a rich brown
in colour, and generously built, on the curvaceous side of plump.
Sitting opposite Frank, she leaned forward, parking her bosom on the
table like a bowl of fruit, and treating him to her most adoring gaze
and her warmest smile. <P>"Why do you call this place Starbucks?" Frank asked, when he seemed to
realise he'd been staring. <P>"Well, Vinod found the sign somewhere, and brought it back for me. We're
not exactly franchised, ha, ha, but it's the closest you'll get for a
hundred kilometres around here. You want coffee? We even had a bottle of
Coca Cola at one point, but it's gone, I'm afraid." <P>"No. The wine's fine. Great." <P>"Have some more. Whereabouts do you come from, Francis?" <P>"Southern Carolina, originally. Near Myrtle Beach. The reclaimed
offshore bit that links to the islands. Educated in Alaska, though, so
I'm used to the cold." <P>"What was your major, then?" <P>"Geological physics." <P>"Cool. I bet you've had some really interesting jobs."  <P>"Yeah, mostly land reclamation for building or cultivation." <P>"Really? Fascinating!" And so on, until the potato wine, the flattery
and Mona's physical charms tempted Frank to confide to her that his
current survey was on behalf of the "space cannon" project. <P>"But, Mona, this is just for you. Not a word to anyone."  <P>Mona was none the wiser. Space cannon? Wtf? "Sure, Frank. Have some more
wine." <P>Frank clammed up after that, and then fell asleep. Mona, of course, told
everyone the news, swearing them to secrecy, and by the following day,
Frank was the only person in the valley who didn't know he'd spilled the
beans to her. Due to potato wine amnesia, Frank's memory of the evening
was a warm, fuzzy blank. Only Eric had any clue what a space cannon was
and he said nothing, but, unusually, he accompanied Vinod on his next
trip to town, leaving the wind farm to its own devices for a week. Eric
returned with a new fat data plug for his j-pad and a thoughtful look on
his face. <P>It should be noted here that Eric's gimcrack windmills were not entirely
original. Kunchen was their intellectual progenitor. Kunchen was one of
the few inhabitants of the valley who, theoretically, "ate idle bread",
to use Eric's expression. A fugitive from a Tibet which no longer
revered the religion of his ancestors, Kunchen had already set up his
wind-powered prayer wheels and prayer cylinders on the southern ridge
long before Eric arrived. Kunchen now split his time between meditative
chanting and unsolicited advice. He regarded Eric's windmills with
suspicion, but approved of the design. He wondered aloud when Eric was
going to write some prayers on the sails of his machines until Eric gave
him permission to write his own, which he did. And, in the event,
Kunchen ever after insisted that these prayers were instrumental in how
things turned out. <P><div class=pullquote>Vinod would make an immediate trip to petition the
Nepalese authorities</div>In due course, as the first cruel horizontal
rains
of autumn began,
Frank left, and, for a while, things went on as they always had. It was
an almost Marxist society - "to each, according to his need; from each,
according to his ability", but actual money did change hands,
principally for trade with the outside world. No-one in the valley went
hungry. The richest people in the valley were David Lee, Vinod, and the
sheep herders. The poorest were those who had migrated to the valley,
but had no contribution to make yet. This year's immigrants were three
in number, of whom only one was a failure. Jean-Paul, a French climber
who had stayed after his expedition left, made furniture from unlikely
scraps of material and did general repairs. David Lee was from Greater
Hong Kong. By that time, so much reclamation had taken place in the hub
of Asian trade that you could walk from Hong Kong island to mainland
Kowloon without getting your feet wet. David had established a sort of
savings and loan organisation which helped to even out the peaks and
troughs in the valley's income and expenditure. David was running at a
loss, but he didn't seem to mind. It was rumoured that he was an
eccentric millionaire with illegal businesses in Hong Kong. The third
immigrant, Anil, was preparing to return to the insanely jam-packed high
rises of Hyderabad before winter set in. He couldn't take the cold, he
missed the constant physical contact with fellow human beings, and he
had never really fitted in. <P>Winter passed relatively quietly. The January gales enabled Eric's wind
farm to reach a new high in power output, with fewer failures than ever
before. Snowfall was fairly light and never much of an inconvenience.
The river never once froze over. Vinod managed two return journeys to
town as early as March. <P><p class=drop>First of April - no joke - an old twin-rotor Samson class
ex-military helicopter laboured over the southern rim of the bowl. A
massive machine, it could carry over two hundred tons of freight, though
the thin air obviously gave it trouble. It landed in a meadow of rough
grass and clover, just upstream of Mona's, on the north bank of the
river, its tail wheel carelessly crushing a pregnant ewe which had been
so paralysed with fear that she failed to run away when the flying
monster appeared. <P>The crew unloaded a dozen heavy crates, several oil-drums and a
mechanical digger. The helicopter roared and whacked its way back
southwards, but eleven men were left behind. The crates contained
pre-fabricated living quarters, generators, furniture, provisions and
office equipment. The drums contained fuel. An unbelievable amount of
fuel. <P>The new arrivals had set up two prefabricated buildings, a generator,
and a satellite dish, surrounded by a high fence, before Mona's
curiosity overcame her irritation at not being formally approached by
the gang. She crossed the bridge and walked the three hundred metres to
their compound, offering food and drink as an ice-breaker, but they
politely informed her in American English that they were
self-sufficient. They needed nothing. They gave her no explanation of
their intentions, but showed her a document in Chinese which they said
conferred upon them licence to drill north of the river. As de-facto
spokesman for the valley, Mona demanded and received a photocopy of the
document. <P>Later, Gulam, an important sheep owner, whose sheep the helicopter had
crushed and in whose spring meadow the Americans were setting up their
operation, barged into the office hut and complained to them. When they
understood what he was complaining about, they gave him a metal suitcase
containing Chinese currency worth sixty thousand dollars, and left him
standing while they got on with their mysterious work. David Lee was
astonished at the size of the sum Gulam deposited with him. <P>The same day, at a hastily arranged noisy multi-lingual conference in
Mona's inn, the inhabitants of the valley expressed their fear of this
development. <P>When it was Eric's turn to speak, he said: "I've been expecting this
ever since Frank was here. I was hoping that the terrain would be
unsuitable, or that the Nepalese administration would kill the idea." <P>David spoke up: "What idea?" <P>"Remember Frank and his space cannon survey last year? I investigated
these space cannons when I went to town. It's a cheap method of sending
bulk materials into orbit, anything that can take a brutal acceleration.
It costs a fraction of lifting them by rocket. They just shoot
containers from a cannon that faces east and is at high altitude, to
take advantage of the earth's rotation and the low atmospheric pressure.
A spacecraft intercepts the projectile and delivers it to where it's
needed." <P>"A cannon?" said Vinod. "A big gun?"  <P>"Yeah, well, the barrel of the gun is sunk a few kilometres into solid
rock, and only the muzzle appears above ground. Then there's the
elevator mechanism to take the payload and the ammunition down to the
loading end." <P>"That's not too bad, then, once it's finished." said David. "Apart from
the noise, of course." <P>Eric looked sad. "The noise is the least of it. Yes, it's going to be a
deafening explosion several times a day. And don't forget the constant
shuttle service of helicopters. But that's not the only reason why they
are built in uninhabited areas. The gun is powered by a small atomic
explosion, and the area around the muzzle becomes contaminated very
quickly." <P>"How big an area?" asked Mona. <P>"The one in the Andes has made a radio-active slick thirty kilometres
long and ten wide. When this cannon gets going, the valley will be
uninhabitable apart from the loading crews in shielded accommodation.
That's why this area is ideal for them. It's isolated, and there aren't
a lot of us to complain about being moved." <P>"So the only hope is to stop the building." said Mona. <P>"You got it." said Eric, rubbing his chin and looking grim. <P>There was lots more discussion, to no particular effect, except that it
was agreed that Vinod would make an immediate trip to petition the
Nepalese authorities to sort out this outrage. Vinod took with him the
photocopy of the licence (which David had read, but whose authenticity
he could not verify) and a shopping list from Eric. The round trip was
scheduled to take at least a week. In the event, he didn't return for a
month. <P><div class=pullquote>The village electricity supply was cut
off, though the windmills still twinkled on the ridge.</div> Meanwhile,
the
helicopter supply trips to the site became a twice-daily
occurrence. More men and equipment arrived. The men working on the job
started to patronise Mona's. The project manager, Billy Macdonald, a
veteran of the Bering Strait tunnel in Alaska, was friendly enough, and
appeared sympathetic with the valley dwellers. David Lee and Eric bribed
one of the helicopter pilots to add a load of copper piping to one of
his trips. Mona was mystified. What use was an additional water supply
when they'd all be leaving soon? David clearly was prepared to fund
Eric's operation, however.  <P>Vinod eventually returned with Ashwali from Kathmandu. Sadly, explained
the official, the licence document issued by the Chinese government was
entirely valid, and had been sanctioned by Nepal in exchange for certain
trade advantages. In fact, satellite imaging and treaty borders
demonstrated that all of the land north of the river had always been
part of the province of Tibet. Only the lower part of the bowl was
actually Nepalese territory. <P>Eric remained very busy for the whole of this time. While everyone else
was letting things slide at the prospect of having to leave this lovely
haven within a year or two, Eric appeared more energetic than ever. He
became thinner and stronger. He worked long hours, frequently arriving
late at Mona's, dirty, often soaked to the skin, and sometimes covered
in scratches and grazes as if he'd been climbing. He spent a lot of time
in his workshop joining sections of pipe in strange configurations. He
started scrounging old clothes and any kind of heavy grease, mostly
mutton fat from the shepherds. He also "borrowed" a cylinder of butane
from Mona, who sometimes cooked with gas. What Eric was actually
planning, though, he would not reveal. <P>As the spring melt began in the mountains, the river started to back up
and form a small lake around the Throat as usual. But this year, it
didn't drain away. The lake kept growing. Jean-Paul built a few
temporary shelters on high ground, and Mona's inn moved uphill, together
with all the villagers. Work on the tunnel for the cannon barrel, now,
inevitably, an open secret, had to stop, as the tunnel and then the
prefabricated buildings on the site became flooded. The cannon workers
were forced to evacuate all their equipment, fuel and stores to higher
ground. And still the water rose. The village electricity supply was cut
off, though the windmills still twinkled on the ridge. <P>Billy Macdonald, seeing his project slowing to a standstill, came to
visit Mona at her makeshift caf&#233;. "Is this unusual?" he asked. He didn't
have to explain what "this" was. <P>"It floods every year." said Mona. "But this is the worst I've seen it." <P>"When does it go down?" <P>Mona was not encouraging. "Couple of months, usually. It doesn't
normally concern us, because it's not remotely this bad." <P>Macdonald also consulted Eric, who was mending a wind turbine on the
southern cliff. To get there, he had to make a wide detour around the
lake and climb several hundred feet. "What do you reckon, Eric?" <P>"In my opinion," Eric replied, "the Throat of Shiva is partially
blocked. At this rate, the lake will fill until the water level reaches
the southern pass and it spills out down the trail to Kathmandu. But by
that time, the whole valley will be one big lake." <P>"We could drill a relief tunnel through the rim, maybe. Take the water
away." <P>"You know as well as I do that by the time you finish that, the lake
will be too big to handle. Wherever you decide to build the relief
tunnel it would have to be above the current level of the lake, and the
lake is already too high for your gun. Nope. You'd better get your
bosses on the blower, and advise them to cut their losses. You must have
an alternative site. It's just unfortunate geology. Something's shifted
down in the tunnel under the Throat. We'll all be out of the valley by
the end of the year, anyway, if the lake keeps growing. And I don't know
if you've noticed, but you can often see the lake steaming in the
mornings, just above where the Throat is. In my opinion, there's
volcanic activity down there. Cut and run is my advice." <P>Billy Macdonald didn't take anyone's word for it. Divers were flown in,
and, though underwater visibility was extremely limited due to the milky
suspension of ground-up rock from the glacier, they could verify that
flow through the Throat appeared to have ceased, and that there was, on
the contrary, a current of warm water coming  up, a clear indication of
volcanic activity below. It was obvious that, even if the flood could be
dealt with, it would be foolhardy to mount a space cannon in an area
where earthquakes were a possibility. <P>In early August, the last workers left the space cannon site. By the end
of September, the lake had disappeared. The temporary inconvenience of
the flood was more than compensated for by the huge volume of supplies,
fuel and building materials the tunnellers had abandoned. <P>Kunchen attributed the miracle to his ancestors. Somehow, however,
everyone else knew that Eric was behind the miracle, but he only creased
his face in a grin when he was asked about it. Only David was ever told
the truth. <P><p class=drop>One evening, Eric and David sat in the setting sun,
braving an energetic
horizontal fall of sleet in the lee of Mona's inn, having drunk an
incautious quantity of Chateau Potato. From inside, they could hear Mona
and Jean-Paul laughing together and four herders quarrelling happily
over their incomprehensible card game while downing cups of buttered
tea. The sound of sheep bells drifted in the breeze as a flock, dimly
visible on the upper slopes, settled for the night. David suddenly
asked: "How did you do it, Eric?" <P>"Blocked the Throat with ice." <P>"Ice? Where did you get it?" <P>"Made it." <P>"But they said it was hot down there, not cold" <P>"Heat pump, David. It's old technology. Electric pump, submersible in
this case, tubes, the stuff we got from the chopper pilot. Basically,
it's how refrigerators work. You pump heat from one part of the system
to another. The pipes have butane in them. When I could still get down
into the Throat, I climbed down and shoved the freezer coils into the
vent. The heating coils were buried in the ground near the Throat before
the lake started. All you could see even before the flood was a couple
of pipes going down, and I hid them as best as I could in the cracks.
Once the lake was there, you couldn't see a thing. Set the pump going,
and a block of ice formed in the vent. What I didn't reckon on at the
time was that the heating coils would produce enough heat to give the
volcanic effect. The main problem was all the electricity and insulation
under the water. I had to make my own Denso tape with rags and mutton
fat. And it took a week or more to form the plug, even though it only
had to cool the water by a few degrees of temperature. And when the wind
dropped halfway through, and I had to go to battery power, the pump
nearly stopped." <P>"So how did you clear the ice?" <P>"Put the heat pump in reverse. They work both ways. No problem there.
And I could block it again if we needed to." <P>The sun dipped below the western ridge, the sky blazed with colour and
the sleet slackened to a soft drizzle. <P>After a moment, David removed one of his sheepskin mittens, adjusted the
earflap of his hat, and said: "Nice here, isn't it?" <P>Eric permitted himself a grin. "Shangri-La, mate, Shangri ruddy La." <P><small>&copy; Gil Williamson 2011 All Rights Reserved </small>
