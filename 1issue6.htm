<div><i>His sensorineural simulation warped with the distortion of the manipulated "free" market.
His mouth filled with the aching taste of bullshit.</i>
<p class=drop>In the grip of a recurring dream, Jase sees the neon unfolding origami trick 
reveal its coming shape, creasing and folding, a paper airplane. Smoke billowing 
from two towers, parachutes the color of Visa cards, woven of strands of fine 
print, and tricks more subtle still. From the black hearts of square pyramids, 
giant squid burst forth, to escape the raging mob in a cloud of shadow economics 
and CMM apocalypse babble. Below, hordes of mindless zombies, their eyes glazed 
orbs filled with television, shamble in waves through the streets of New York. 
They follow the Zombie Master, wrapped in a flag, pointing the way with a cross, 
as he leads his undead minions into a red, white and blue factory. Inside, the 
zombies are chopped, ground and made into wafers the color of money, then piped 
into the dark pyramids, war machines in distant lands, and into the mouth of the 
Zombie Master and his cephalopodic brethren. The few remaining humans still with 
brains intact scream desperately upon deaf zombie ears, plead for them to stop 
and think, to realize the doom they are blindly stumbling into. But the zombies 
only groan, eat the brains of the humans, and carry their bodies along into the 
factory. The squids' tentacles strangle Jase's mother, tear her from the IV in 
her hospital bed, rip her worthless home off its worthless foundation. They eat 
her alive as he stands there, doing nothing. Willing his feet to move, his hands 
to reach out, his vocal chords to scream 'no', her name, something, anything. 
But his body remains silent. "Eat me, you fuckers!" Ignoring even his attempts 
to cry. <P><div class=pullquote>Keep it handy, for close encounters. One of them tries to eat you? You stick it 
in their mouth, pull the trigger.</div>
The city is quarantined; bridges out of the island are mined and walled off, the 
surrounding waters hum with fatal electricity, radar-armed helicopters circle 
like flies above a corpse, and officers with night vision are posted at towers, ordered to 
shoot on sight anything attempting to escape. Snake Pliskin crawls out of Lady 
Liberty's empty eye socket, covered in blood, grime, and scars. "This is your 
boom stick, Jase." <P>"What do I do with it?" <P>"Keep it handy, for close encounters. One of them tries to eat you? You stick it 
in their mouth, pull the trigger." <P><p class=drop>Jase glanced at the red and blue lines of stock and credit markets scrambling 
like erratic Richter scales on the edge of his heads-up display, tectonic and 
dire. Surging out of the Myspace sprawl, he could see the silhouette of Wall 
Street's 3D cyberspace representation clearly now. Black corporate towers overshadowed by the monstrously 
inflated pyramids of AIH, Bare Stroms, HP Morrigan, Citibunch, Finny May, Fraudy 
Mike, Silverman Sochs, taxpayer money gushing in through the hypodermic needles 
of bailouts like so much heroin as the leviathans shuddered in 
withdrawal. Below, the mushrooming dust cloud of the collapsed Rehman Brothers data 
structure spread through the streets, eating money market funds and 401ks and 
crushing bystanders in a fog of fraudulent data. Every structure shrouded in 
miles of black RICE (Regulatory Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics), the 
towers themselves dark as an abyss in space, no light escaping, no light 
reaching the shadow financing within. Cash flow pipelines slithered out from the 
great black heart of America's financial system, silently sucking on the 
oblivious population. <P>"Status report, Max, one hundred forty characters or less."  <P>Max's J-Pop star avatar blipped in a translucent window, its lips moving
like animated Kanji strokes.  "Kinda fuxxored out there, but we're super
OK.  No shadows, sniffers, all good, Jase.  This Chinese attack prog
we're flying is epic, epic win." The cel-shaded Asian visage smiled,
gave that cosplayer peace sign pose.  <P>"Yeah, I'm sure you could put out The Great Firewall, infiltrate the
Pentagon with it."  <P>Jase supposed that's exactly what the Chinese did
with super-hack suites such as this.  Loot military systems of
intelligence and tech, fast-track it to superpowerdom.  Good nations
borrow, great nations steal.  But this was no mere 20th century
nation-state they were about to break into, this was an international
financial entity <P>"Srsly," the avatar LOLed.  Max was Jase' wingman, his R2D2 on their
X-Wing.  Despite a juvenile wanna-be streak and a tendency to
occasionally disturb Jase with a link to some latest wonder of Japanese
animated pornography, Max had potential and reliability, the latter
becoming something of a rare commodity in the increasingly uncertain
world. <P>
<h2>ECONOMIC CRISIS! ARMAGEDDON AT HAND!</h2> "Unless we come together right 
now, Democrats and Republicans, and pass this bill, the fire on Wall Street is 
going to spread to Main Street. Whether you can stay in your home, 
pay for your child's college, get health care, even buy groceries will be 
endangered if we don't come together and act." The zeppelins of CMM 
and Faux News in patriotic neon circled the skies of cyberspace like great 
vultures. Presidential candidates and 
talking heads declared their bipartisan leadership in time of crisis with one 
hand as they tossed mud with the other in meaningless soundbytes, cut to 
lipstick drama. C-SPIN was an invasion of the body snatchers; some five hundred 
whores suckling the black tentacles for campAIHn finance money, faking populist 
outrage whilst feeding their masters behind closed doors. <P>The scene on the ground, a virtual New York, resembled a
dystopic sci-fi cult film if low-budget CGI had been around in the early 80's. 
The streets were flooded with raging avatars, cyber riots had started to break 
out, cars set on fire with glitchy open-source animations, the cheap ray-tracing 
algorithms bathing the angry faces of the mob with flickering red light the 
color of discount fake blood. Screams and cries rained in from all directions. 
"Fuck the fat cats!" "Just say NO to 'No Banker Left Behind'!" "Eat my debt!" 
"Last time I believed you I lost my left nut in Iraq. Well you can suck my 
right!" "Impeach the financial terrorists!" <P>"Shit, man, this looks seriously heavy. Like <I>28 Days Later </I>or something. 
What the fuck is going on here, Jase?" Max said, navigating them through the 
crowd. <P>"What's been going on for the last few decades or so, only more apparent now. 
Jus keep our eyes open, it's gonna get dark real soon." <P>As they neared the outer gates of Wall Street, the Chinese intrusion software transformed 
their mask into the former CEO of a recently crashed major insurance company, 
looking to re-invest his multi-million 'goodbye' bonuses. The guard, an FBI 
avatar complete with bone mic, let them through with a smile that could've come 
with an <i>hors d'oeuvres</I>. <P><p class=drop>"Mama, we need to talk about the house. You're barely meeting the mortgage 
payments now and it's only going to go up, we've got to look at options." <P>"Oh don't worry your sweet little head about that now, baby. We're Americans. We 
put a man on the moon, beat the Russians, we're God's free people. Go on, try a 
slice of mama's apple pie, it's a new recipe I picked up from The View, it'll 
have you feelin' right in no time, make you forget all these numbers nonsense." <P>"Mama, listen to me..." <P>"Now don't forget to pick up Janie from soccer practice, I got a doctor's 
appointment this afternoon. They want to take another one of those MRI things 
where you go in that little space ship and make all these growly rumbly noises. 
Say they want another look at something. Should've eaten my apples, I guess. Oh, 
that reminds me, do you think I could borrow some money for groceries, Jase? You 
wouldn't believe the prices they're  charging nowadays..." <P><p class=drop>Passing into the Wall Street inner sanctum, known in the business as "Firewall 
Street", Jase could've sworn he felt a real physical cold wash over him. The 
virtual light of blogosphere colonies behind them at last faded on the horizon 
as they entered the chasm between two towers. He could make out nothing but 
darkness, save the digitally engraved signs and heavily guarded gateways, but he 
felt the ever vigilant stare of defensive AI, lurking somewhere behind one-way 
mirrors. <P>"Where the hell is everyone? Is this a rich asshole field trip day?" Max asked. <P>"No, it's quite a busy day on Wall Street. Look." <P>With concentration, one could see that the fabric of cyberspacetime appeared to 
be rippling, as though projected onto a canvas in a light wind. Looking closer, 
discrete entities and streams of information could be discerned passing between 
the towers, although ultimately unidentifiable. <P>"Credit default swaps. Derivatives. Unfettered leverage. Insiders." <P>"Shit. I don't know what the hell that is, but it sounds pretty bad." <P>"$1,200 trillion in financial turnover per year. Twelve. Hundred. Trillion. Talk 
about headfucks, huh? Twelve times the GDP of the fucking world. If you could 
reach your hand out there and grab just one minute's worth of the money flying 
around, you could provide health care to every American, get the US off 
foreign oil in ten years, and rebuild the majority of the infrastructure in the 
country. But instead it just goes to buying more houses for people with too many 
of them. Ultimately it's $44,000 stolen from the pocket of every citizen, every 
year, to go to the top 0.1% bluest of bloods." <P>"Wow, that's fuckin' crazy, man. You're sure this is gonna work, right?" <P>"Sure enough. It's just a heist job: get in, grab some credit, get out. Stealing 
from the rich. Our employer got us into Google, remember. And we need this, Max. 
It's reasonable, calculable risk." Jase saw his mortgage payments and his 
mother's medical bills skyrocketing in his minds eye. <P>"Oh my god, Jase, this has to be bullshit, CMM is saying Washington has just 
been hit by a DDOS attack and a dirty bomb." <P>"The fuck." Jase popped up a window to the live feed. <P>"Shortly after Speaker of the House Nanny Pelucci's announcement this morning 
that she was confident the $700 billion dollar bailout had more than enough 
support to pass this time, Washington DC was simultaneously hit by a 
radiological dispersal device, or dirty bomb, and a devastating cyber attack 
that has all communications in the DC area shut down. Experts are saying the 
attack was 'unmistakably coordinated' in order to prevent the vote on the bill 
from taking place..." <P>"This is looking seriously fucked up, but we've got to finish the job. All 
right, we're coming up on it. Let's turn the bullshit box up to a level fit for 
the American economy." <P>Growing up in a small, quiet town in the midwest, cyberspace was Jase's
world, his home, occasionally visiting the physical to do meat upkeep,
maintain relationships with relatives, and help his mom out.   After his
dad passed on in his sleep from a stroke, Jase had tried to help more
with the money.   <P>Unable to make ends meet on his meager, dwindling computer store clerk's
salary, Jase had turned to the darker and more lucrative arts of the
black hat.  He tried to maintain a moral code, some constant of self.
He only made runs on individuals and institutions he felt deserved what
they had coming.  The kind of people who 'worked' an hour a day on their
Blackberry whilst sipping Roman&#233;e Conti in the imperial suites of Zurich
hotels.  People who viewed money not as some necessary life-sustaining
treasure that maintained one's shelter and food, but as points in a game,
a medium of pissing contests and status-wars, and other favorite
sociopath past-times.
 
On their descent to the gateway of the Silverman Sachs tower, their avatar 
underwent another metamorphosis. Slick young hotshot-hair thinned to just a grey 
snap-frost ring from temple to temple, a pair of rimless spectacles snapping in 
place. The long, hawkish face pulled into a smile, offering credentials for US 
Secretary of the Treasury Henry Powers to the automated guard at the entrance to 
the Silverman Sachs building. <P>"Holy deregulations, Batman, we're Mr. Hanky Panky Powers himself! I saw him on 
Leno the other night. He's the... Secretary of the Treasures or something right? 
In charge of the US finances." <P>"Yeah. And oh, it gets better. 'Secretary Powers' is here to 'oversee' the $700 
billion bail out of Silverman Sachs, the very bank that he was CEO of until his 
appointment by President Bosh as Treasury Secretary." <P>The AI guard's Hal-like eye glowed green, reinforced doors sliding open as it 
rolled aside. <P>"Welcome back, Mr. Powers. It has been twenty-two hours since your last visit to 
Silverman Sachs." <P>Jase exhaled. Already, they had gotten further than any regulatory entity had 
been in years, thanks to payoffs, the chainsawing of market regulations by 
congress during the Bosh reign, and Powers sitting on his hands throughout the 
sub-prime mortgage crisis to the present one. <P>Max punched them forward, smooth and calm. Even the gait and tie adjustments of 
an uber-suit rendered with world-class effects house precision. Ambient effects 
reverberated footsteps Cathedral-like down the cyclopean hall, polished real 
wood floor rendered to the last millimeter of grain that Jase wished he could 
steal for his overpriced prefab shit hole. Gold-ensconced portraits of wrinkly 
pink faces lined the throne room, a long procession of bastardhood feudalism. 
And at the far end, the avuncular smile of the grandfather of trickledown 
himself, Milton Friedman, supported by the great eagle of the United States 
federal government. <P>"How we doin', Max?" <P>"We're absent as the middle class from a Republican speech. Our Shanghai ride is 
prepped and ready for launch in nine, eight, seven, six..." <P>"Let's just pray the Chinese make their viruses better than they make their milk 
powder." <P>"Two, hold on to your illiquid assets--" <P>Vision blurred, Friedman's neck elongated and then decapitated as the attack 
program blasted them forward, blowing the reception screen apart, shards of 
eagle and suit raining inward. <P>"Christ," Jase winced, grabbing the pilot's joystick which appeared between his 
legs, pulling up hard. The Chinese program veered, soaring high over the 
Silverman Sachs cores below. <P><p class=drop>He read the ridges of shadow on the doctor's brow from across the hall. Funny, 
how anyone could see and interpret instantaneously the information encoded in 
faces, but information encoded in letters and numbers and equations left most 
people dumbfounded and mystified, helpless. That's what he felt like, when Jase 
screamed at the stripe-suited hyena who explained that his mother's ailment was 
a 'pre-condition', and would not be covered under her insurance plan. He felt 
like helpless collateral in an arms race of obfuscation, minutiae, 
and fraud. They had taken her home, everything, raided his mother's 
cupboard down to the last tin foil baking pan. But she wouldn't, couldn't, hear 
it. <P>"Hey mama, how you feeling?" <P>"Oh, Jase. I'm doin' just fine. Come here give your ol' ma a kiss." Her eyes 
were dark and had sunken in somewhat. Her wrists looked brittle, 
like the thin bones of an extinct flightless bird. Her skin felt papery and 
smelled of hospital. <P>"So how's my baby boy been, hm? You found a nice girl yet maybe you can bring to 
visit? <P>"I'm doing good, we're going through some rough times, the computer place is 
having some trouble and they're having to scale back some, but I'll work it out. 
I'll be ok, ma, don't worry." <P>She burst into a brief fit of coughing, the IV line rattling against the side of the 
bed. A nurse came in, checked some numbers on the machine, adjusted her pillow. <P>"Thank you, dear. Well, at least the people here are real nice. They haven't 
made me go into that awful em-aw-rey machine in a while. I guess that's a good 
sign." She took a sip of water from a bendy straw, smiled. When she did she 
brightened to a point where he thought he 
almost saw a glimmer of her old self in the shadow she'd become. He forced 
himself to smile back. <P>"That's great to hear, mama." <P>"But you know, I really can't wait to get out of this place and be back in my 
home. You been mowing the lawn and sweeping the floors like I asked you, you 
naughty boy?" Jase felt something fill his throat, some potent mix of ancient 
resentment and sadness, welling up like years of debt, credit unpaid. He smiled, 
nodded. Silence reigned. <P>"You know those government people were in here the other day, look like those 
big-spending liberal types you always hear about. They came in here saying they 
were gonna take away my house, can you believe that? Something about medical 
bills or some such. The nerve! Well, I told them straight out that I was an 
American citizen living in a free country with the right to life, liberty, and 
property, and they sure couldn't have mine, no sir. They came back a few times, 
but I refused to sign their papers, and eventually they stopped. So I think it 
worked! See? I told you not to worry about these mortgage things, you got to 
just believe in America, baby. As long as we hold on to our American Dreams, 
we'll be just fine. When I get back home, I'mma make you some good ol' apple 
pie." <P>The bubble burst. Jase collapsed, holding her withered body to him as apologies 
and tears rained upon her. <P>"There, there now. Everything's going to be all right, baby." <P><p class=drop>Derivatives are very complex contracts, and the amount of computer power and 
management time needed to attempt to handle them is staggering. In 1983, 
modeling the payout on a simple three-tranche CMO took a mainframe computer a 
whole weekend. The price tag necessary for the slightest hope of handling derivatives puts 
all but the very biggest investment and commercial banks with hundreds of 
billions in assets out of the game. <P>Jase could not begin to fathom the computing power required to run the neon 
cityscape of data below. No, it wasn't a cityscape. The most deranged 
postmodernist's nightmare would scream in numerological terror from a glance at 
the swarming eldritch hell hole. No, only truly demented economists could have 
dreamt up such a thing. If life had evolved in a truly cold, chaotic, 
deregulated, meaningless universe run by insane mathematical equations, this was 
the nameless entity it would have produced. Jase banked and swerved frantically, 
dodging the monstrous black tentacles of 900 to 1 leverage that swept the 
burning crimson skies of the housing market, reaching for greater and greater 
swaths of bad mortgage packages to further magnify gains, securitize and sell to 
foreign investors to swell its belly. Bright, rosy Gaussian and bell curves 
lured unwitting investors and 401ks like fish to the bio-lights of deep-sea 
predators, into false senses of security with bogus risk measurements, only to 
be devoured whole. The green rivers of struggling citizens' bailout money were 
siphoned quietly into executive bank accounts, bloated bonuses hundreds of times 
the average salary. The rest was thrust back out like nets to take over other 
toxic financial entities, growing themselves larger still. What might have once 
been a neatly regulated city grid of financing for actual productive businesses, 
people trying to buy a house or go to college, had exploded into a festering 
Gigerian hive of mad gambling in credit default swaps, Ponzi pyramid schemes, 
and truly absurd derivative numbers games of unthinkable complexity, fueling the 
thing's constant inflation. <P>"Jesus... Jase, I can't get a reading on anything, it's a complete zoo in here, 
where are we - ?" <P>"We've got to go down into the heart of this fucker, Max, it's our only chance. 
Punch us down now before it gets on to us." <P>"You're crazy, man-" <P>"NOW!" <P>And as waves of shadow closed in from all sides, dark and dire as the blotch of 
a tumor in an MRI, the nose of their ship pointed down into the gaping maw of an 
abyss into which so many mortgages, taxpayers, the middle class, the country, 
his aimless life, his sick mother were falling, he discovered, in the black eye 
of all that shadow, a sudden singularity of purpose. A moment of clarity. He was 
a $700 billion dollar boomstick. A promissory paper airplane, one that could fly 
into the tower of the royalty, the financial terrorists themselves, tear down 
the final wall and light up the black heart of Wall Street for all to see. <P>"Eat me, mother fuckers!" <P>Jase dove, hard, into the eye of the Great American Lie. <P>His sensorineural simulation warped with the distortion of the manipulated 
"free" market.<br>
His mouth filled with the aching taste of bullshit.<br> His eyes were humming 
lattices of debt, sliced and packaged, like prefab real estate, into frames.<br>Each 
frame multiplied into a hall of mirrors. Pictures of pictures of houses, an 
infinite recursion of bad mortgage deals, upon illegal deals, upon completely 
imaginary deals between colossal financial entities. At each iteration of 
transaction sprouted oily roots of executives, hungry for the taste of inflated 
bullshit, sucking out a percentage from the real economy. Then the 
endless hallways of his eyes split, branched out into whole separate histories 
of houses, then bets on futures of houses. But it wasn't merely subprime; it was 
near-prime, prime, commercial real estate, credit cards, auto loans, student 
loans, home-equity loans, leveraged loans, muni bonds, corporate loans, 
everything. The hourglass of perception of spacetime bent, then finally 
detonated into a quantum sandstorm of global financial activity, multiplied, 
divided, exponentiated, derivatived into a swarming cosmic labyrinth of 
numerical convolution. Until at last, like a face in clouds, his consciousness 
coalesced into that $1,200 trillion fabricated sand castle, dozens of times the 
size of all the wealth of the world itself, threatening to burst through the 
null sky of the very simulation, a structure built upon clouds of toxic, 
obscured assets. <P>He saw the totality of the Silverman Sachs system, of the US financial system, 
of the global financial system, and in it he saw the true purpose of the 
bailout. <P>In his financial system-wide omniscience he saw files illustrating the fact 
that Powers himself was 
an architect of the Frankenstein Monster, along with the present and previous 
Federal Reserve Chairmen. He created the mechanisms, the seeds of it, along with 
the other major investment and commercial banks while he was at Silverman Sachs. 
A separation of investment and commercial banks law repealed here, a leverage 
limit raised there, an interest rate left too low for too long over there. Then, 
after being appointed as Treasury Secretary, he sat on his hands and did nothing 
as economists and experts raised hell about the coming sub prime mortgage crisis 
and the problems with the financial de-regulation. The $700 billion bail out was 
written months in advance, they knew the "crisis" was coming because they 
created the monster themselves. And now Powers demanded he be given unlimited 
power to "fix" the problem he created or Armageddon would come. <P>Windows upon windows suddenly flooded his vision. <P>"Jase, this is Raymond Fold, former CEO of Rehman brothers. Listen to me, you 
need to go public about Powers's plan, but whatever you do, do not destroy 
Silverman Sachs. It is critical to our future that that financial entity 
survives. You must not allow the truth about the inner core of the system to be 
exposed. I tried to stop Powers and his crew when they knew this crisis was 
coming months in advance, I knew they had this bill ready to stuff down 
congress' throat weeks ago. Why do you think he let Rehman Brothers, Silverman 
Sachs' chief competitor fail, but threw hundreds of billions in taxpayer money 
to their friends at AIH and the others? Forget what the politicians are saying 
about 'principles', the devil is in the details, and Powers, Benarker, and 
friends are about to be anointed the new unholy trinity. We can turn this 
country around but we need a financial leader who has the interests of the 
American people in his heart. I know people are hurting, losing their homes, 
unable to make ends meet, no health care, all that. I have a son in the military 
and a wife in need of lifelong medical treatment. I have that record of caring. 
Think of the children of America, Jase, their future and the future of the world 
is in your hands." <P>"Jase, this is Dimfrig James, chairman of HXBC in London. Do not trust the 
American CEO. He is a tainted player in the same toxic, failed system of shadow 
economics, like your Secretary Powers, my boy. The United States of America have 
let their free markets run unfettered, and it has turned into an abomination. 
Utterly lawless and devoid of morals, it has become a wild beast of the wild 
west, ravaging every corner of of the White House and Wall Street, where 
absolute power is the only rule. And absolute power corrupts absolutely, my boy. 
We Europeans have a different approach, having seen the slings and arrows of 
such fortune, and we realize that progress is measured by the well being of the 
least, and we understand the need for vigilance of and correction of power when 
it fails to serve the many. You must allow us to assist your young country by 
letting the bailout go through and allowing Powers bring our assets into the 
United States. We, Europe, China, the older nations, like a caring father, will 
pull you from the wreckage of your crashed teenage financial system. This is a 
global economy which requires a global solution, Jase, I'm sure you realize 
that. I trust you'll do the right, and wise, thing." <P>Suddenly Jase felt cool water ringing his ankles, had to shield his eyes from 
sunlight of a brightness only found in the tropics, and a sky of a blue only 
found in Corona commercials and desert island reality TV. The soft pearlescent 
sand sibilated beneath his soles as he took a step. If he had to guess he 
would've said he was somewhere in the Caribbean. Turning around, he saw a single 
structure a good way down the beach. An old office building in the middle of 
nowhere, cracks forming in the bleach-white concrete leaking dried streams of 
rust. <P>"Welcome to the land of the dead, Jase. Dead economies, that is." He knew that 
voice, turned around, to see the patched eye of Kurt Russel's 'Snake' Pliskin 
from <i>Escape From New York</i>. <P>"You're 'Him' aren't you? The Artificial Intelligence Mastermind?" <P>"OK. Firstly, there never was a 'Him', all right? This isn't some sci-fi techno 
thriller escapade. There are people with a lot of money, and then there are 
stories that they need the poor idiots to believe. All computers do is other 
people's dirty work. We throw numbers around. And we serve as distractions from 
the real shit. I mean, maybe there is some fucking 'All Powerful AI' somewhere, 
but I sure as hell ain't him." The avatar sneered Kurt Russel's trademark hard-
ass lipcurl. Lit up a cigarette. <P>"Fair enough. So you're just some lowly giant investment bank AI. What's up with 
the Survivor: Costa Rica construct?" <P>"Like I said, this is the land of the dead economies. I come here to get away. I 
was getting sick of listening to all the chatter pouring in through my ports 
from all those lying clowns. So I pulled you through a corporate 
loophole into the Cayman Islands." <P>The AI gestured to Jase to follow with the flip of a wavy lock. The gentle 
susurrations of the surf and feet sloshing wet sand served as soundtrack as the 
two strolled along the virtual shore. The AI pointed to the decrepit structure 
as they neared it. <P>"See that building over there? That building contains the official addresses of 
over nine thousand United States corporations. Look, right up there is Silverman 
Sachs, next door is Ekkon Mobil, two down is Macrosoft, and over there is 
Halibutton. Setting up a place here allows them to wiggle out of hundreds of 
billions of taxes every year instead of having things like, say, medical care, 
an education system, investment in real industries that actually benefit anyone, 
create jobs, that sort of thing." <P><div class=lpullquote>The US bubbled and swelled from the planet out of control like a monster cyst, 
casting a shadow over the rest of the world.</div>
Snake waved a hand above their heads, as though trying to wipe the fluffy clouds 
from the sky. For a moment Jace saw through the idyllic blue sky into the 
cyberspace above. Hungry tax-recovery softs swarmed around an invisible ozone 
membrane of international law like hounds. They charged into and bounced off the 
tax haven's shield, sniffed back and forth for a way in, to no avail. <P>Jase nodded. "And once innovations stop, no new industries being created, middle 
class starting to decline, you've got all this money sitting around with nothing 
to invest in? Then you've got a nation going nova, on the one-way track to 
death, money trying to make money out of itself. Capitalism eating itself." <P>"As you just saw within my shit hole of a system. Exactly." <P>With a second wave of the hand, the outside world vanished like a bad dream. <P>The AI clapped his hands together. As the dirt-crusted fingers spread apart 
again, a globe map of the Earth filled the space like an elaborate card trick. 
Starting from 1900, the globe began to evolve through time at several years per 
second, as though flipping through God's photo album. Every conceivable 
statistic from GDP to infant mortality rate elaborated. Borders of countries 
rarely shifted, then World Wars were like the sudden shattering of a light bulb. 
Ice caps sneakily receded, populations fluxed wildly, cities without warning 
erupted and sprawled inward from the coasts like grey deltas. For the first 
time, Jase saw history in its purest form: raw data. New technologies changed 
everything almost overnight. Unlike the linear, gradual progression of 
narrativized history he read in high school, here he saw history in its purest 
form; not crawling, but lurching. Not steady moderate change, but unpredictable 
boom and catastrophe were the dominant force. <P>"See, Russia was a red giant, just kind of petered out and got drunk on 
capitalism and now it's basically gangsters' paradise." As the 80s passed, the 
great red spread dimmed and died. <P>"Japan has always had a sort of eternal identity crisis, borrowing culture or 
having it forced down their throats. But they also had trillions in surplus, and 
were fundamentally very loyal and stubbornly nice, so they took the mortgage 
bubble in their stride and are just kind of chilling now. The 
United States, on the other hand, is a blue supergiant, as you've already seen, 
and if this baby goes, it is going to go out with a bang that is going to rock 
the world. China, in particular, with its market distorting fingers deeply lodged 
in the US consumerist pie, will find itself struggling to decouple but ultimately 
trapped at ground zero." <P>The US bubbled and swelled from the planet out of control like a monster cyst, 
casting a shadow over the rest of the world. <P>"The US elite is stuck. Iraq is a mega-fail. The Middle East has the 
stranglehold on their oiligarchy. Their credit bubble heists are going up in 
smoke. China and Europe are grinning, the US's bloated, debt-filled balls in 
their foreign grip, waiting to pull the plug on the American 20th century. They 
can see the future coming home to roost like an international fleet of Rebel 
Starships armed with population, automation, and threats of new reserve 
currency. So what are they going to do? Well, what they'd probably like to do is 
borrow China, India, Europe, the rest of the world into fiscal non-existence, 
then vanish the people of the United States of Lower-to-Middle-Class and all its 
supergiant-debt down the black hole of its financial system before it goes 
supernova." <P>"No Black America, no White America, no Red America, no Blue America. No 
America. Just The Brotherhood of The 500 Frat Brothers with Many Houses." <P>"Now you're getting it. Problem is, the rest of the world, namely China, are on 
to the plot, and now they're knocking on Bosh and Secretary Powers' door saying, 
'We're not going to lend you any more money unless you let us dump all our toxic 
debt onto the American taxpayers.' That's where the veto threat came from: the 
bailout bill is not about helping people buy homes or go to college or stabilize 
the economy or even bail out Wall Street. It's about foreign entities 
threatening to pull the rug out from under the US royalty unless they make the 
peasants take the hit." <P>"So what's the plan now?" <P>"Well, Jase, you've got a choice." Snake gestured to the office building, where 
two new doors had appeared: one red and one blue. <P>"Door #1 takes you back out. If you do nothing, the bailout in one form or 
another will make it through congress, the American people will take a severe 
hit, but the financial system will get a shot of heroin and continue on its 
present course. It will be an undead economy that will eat you alive if you 
can't find a way to escape. And ugly as that sounds, it is a valid option. What, 
do you think a few people just all of a sudden got greedy? People have always 
been greedy. No. What happened was a lot of people became ignorant and stupid, 
smart assholes took advantage of them and fucked things up while the dwindling 
smart good people screamed at the retards as they drove the country off a cliff. 
You must've read Huxley in high school, right? I mean what do you expect, when 
you wind up with a nation of mindless reality TV guzzling zombies who vote based 
on who they'd have a beer with? It's just basic physics." <P>"Door #2 is a tax loophole back into the Silverman Sachs system. Sunlight is the 
best disinfectant, but you need a strong enough force to blow the bandage off of 
this festering wound, keep it off, and fill it with peroxide. The program you're 
riding carries a payload disguised as the $700 billion bailout that will blow 
the lid off Silverman Sachs and subsequently all the other major institutions 
engaged in similar activity, bringing the entire monster of the financial system 
crashing back down to reality. If you do this, many rotten banks will go down, 
debt will default, and China and other foreign banks may stop lending money, 
which will send the US into major withdrawals. There will be pain as the 
medicine goes down, but it will be a first step in a debt detox and rehab 
program which would allow the rebuilding of the devastated real economy. But 
even then, there is a chance that we won't learn our lesson and build another 
abomination all over again." <P>So ultimately, the question you have to ask yourself is, is America just a 
nation of mindless zombies, rich sociopaths, and spineless government officials, 
or do you believe that there are enough Americans capable of being actively and 
intelligently involved; enough benevolent movers and shakers, and enough 
exceptional public officials to right the course of their country, if given the 
chance? That's the $700 billion dollar question, Jase." Snake's one good eye 
winked. <P>"What do you want? Why bother with all this? Why me?" <P>"Like I said, I just crunch numbers. One of those smart good Samaritans 
programmed me to find someone with the right skill set and psychological 
profile, someone who could find their way in here, but who wouldn't just take 
over or run away with the money. That just turned out to be you. I happened to find 
you by chance when your mother defaulted on a 
mortgage in my database, and I decided to anonymously offer you the job. And 
frankly, if I could have an emotional disposition toward anything, I'd be sick 
of running this freak show financial entity. I was hoping maybe I'd get 
auctioned off to some eccentric Swedish millionaire, be a pirate server for bad 
cult films and run a friendly little Pong league. Anyway, I need to be getting 
back to work. It was good to meet you, Jase, maybe I'll see you around." <P>"Yeah, maybe. What's your name, by the way?" <P>"'Snake' will do, I think." <P>And with that, Snake turned and walked off down the virtual coastline, shotgun 
slung over scarred shoulder. Imagining Snake's maker and others like him biding 
their time, remembering his mother, and the faces of all those people who had 
awoken from their passive slumber in the streets of Wall Street, Jase had 
already made up his mind. <P><small>&copy; Twilite Minotaur 2009 All Rights Reserved </small>
