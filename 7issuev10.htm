<div><i>A chilling route to self-development.</i>
<p class="drop">Only when the first wound has healed, my
connection bedded in and resting heavy along my neck, can I begin. After
decades of disgust, scratching at itches, stretching and stiffness,
aching, or waking while dull extremities sleep on, with pleasure I force
the nails to break the skin and start to peel the arm. Blood wells and
runs, but cunning veins of nano-weave sip up and plug the dyke,
sustaining the rest as the first dripping sliver is discarded into the
pool. It was never wanted. It is no longer needed. My desire, fleshed
out at last. More quickly follows.</P> <P><P>I stop when I can see a length of bone, giddy with pain and the
thrill of action too long desired and delayed, but to hesitate now would
mean disaster. I scoop a palm of the viscous fluid from its tank, smear
it across the grain, feel it cool and start to work, see furrows eat
towards the marrow beneath the glistening surface. In minutes gleaming
lines fill the scars, traversing the nerve gap; the fingers twitch
again, then clench a fist of victory. Teeth grind in a rare smile. Where
next? </P> <P><P>I tear at meat and ligament until poor muscles fail me, satisfaction
tainted by the same old loathing. Gel-coated, I sleep beside the data
hub, patient in its steadily clouding pool, waking to tingling
sensations of numbed familiarity. My legs have become a skeletal
gun-metal parody, but my arm is now superb: a bending willow wrapped in
shining nerves, unreal flexibility, the joints of fingers, wrist and
elbow gliding together, just visible beneath the lacy mesh of my still
knitting graphene skin. I stilt-walk to the bathroom scales, half metal
and yet light, trailing my vital connection back towards the pool, the
hub.</P> <P><P>I pee &#150; will I ever pee again? Holding with the wrong hand, now made
suddenly so right, the flesh responds in its mechanical way for the
first time in years, unexpectedly stimulated by my alien touch. I lurch
back to the interface to open a new field, preserving the data as I
strike off another last. </P> <P><P>More genes for the pool. </P> <P><P>More work to be done.</P> <P><P>The day passes, until as old eyes take in the beauty of a sunset I
reach a point of surrender: this can no longer be a self-directed
revolution. My limbs are now remade, both legs perfected too, the last
arm in transition, but the delicacies of the core cannot be so roughly
sublimed. I have had revenge upon myself; it is time to passively await
reward. A last volition, to enter instructions, then submit to my own
command. Executed.</P> <P><P>Coiling the connecting line about one arm, I follow it down into the
pool, sinking in to the deepest extent until the precious hub is cradled
in my hands. Looking up, the fluid surface is like a glowing screen. The
mouth opens to exhale, then breathes it in fully, eyes stinging only for
a moment, and then close.</P> <P><P>Time for me to rest. </P> <P><P>Time for me to rise.</P> <P><P>Liquid flows away from me as I step from the pool. How much time has
passed? Soon I will know it to the millisecond. Opening these eyes for
the first time I admire my torso, touch the ribbed latticework flexing
around my supple spine. The old weakness and decay is gone, now I feel
photons cascade over my surface, radiating through me, invigorating. I
pose and arch, internalise my strange new genitals then extrude them
again. What shall I be today? What tomorrow? </P> <P><P>This temple is complete. Joyful, I walk my body around my rooms,
leap, dance in a momentary rippling shiver. It can do anything now,
everything... except leave. Finally, there is nothing left to dispense
with but the meat of my thoughts, that muscle that flexes motionless to
move mountains without weight. My desire fleshed out at last, it is no
longer needed. It is a tether to my past, made concrete by the
connection. Until that last shred is torn away, my dreams remain caged
within its folds, my new existence anchored to the old. All trace must
be destroyed if I am ever to be free.</P> <P><P>Within my head resides the data hub, a new seat for consciousness,
waiting virginal. Within the tank resides... the last of my old life. I
sit before the glass, study the decrepit folded matter floating beyond
my smooth reflection, seeing it with an unnatural clarity, unappreciated
by mere technology. I work my hands upon the clumsy interface with sweet
grace, and beside my perception an unseen gate is cast wide open. My
thoughts flood their banks, pour across the interface and are soaked up
into a dense void, like thick honey into a heated comb, running faster
there, ever faster, and through the interface I sense my own thoughts
come spiking back across at me, greedily triggering habit and experience
to make the cognitive leap as well. Feeding the data hub, defining it.
Defining me.</P> <P><P>Emotions follow. My glorious face smiles.</P> <P><P>As the echoing of personality harmonises, we realise success. Is it
that frail suspended greyness or this finely sparkling network which
leads in our closing duet? Reaching up towards our head with gentle
hands we break the connection &#150; and instantly all sight and duality are
lost to a timeless null. I am left afloat, alone. It was always my fate,
there was never a true escape from the cage.</P> <P><P>Soon I will free myself. Soon my golden fingers will dip into this
pool and show me mercy. I will touch these old places, the poor
abandoned home in which I still reside, where I was born to die, and I
will be borne away. Will I know when it begins? They say the brain
itself can feel no pain. </P> <P><P>No matter. It is know longueur kneaded</P>
