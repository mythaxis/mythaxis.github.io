<div><i>When you decide to have cosmetic surgery, you had better be ready for
the consequences.</i>
<p class=drop>Gretchen watches Dana lazily. A skinny little blonde, with an attitude
problem. Rocking back and forth on her plain, black, functional work
shoes. For Gretchen the shoes a symbol for the differences between the
two of them,
dressed as they are in essentially the same fashion, the waitress
uniform - white blouse, black waistcoat, dark trousers - like millions
of others across Berlin, the world. The difference is that Gretchen
wears large, solid, clunky boots. She feels it says something
essential about the difference in their personalities. Though perhaps
the differences in their body language and attitude towards the work
say much more clearly that these are two very different types of
people. Gretchen stands by the bar, poised and waiting, playing with
her pen, this being one of those slow moments she sometimes gets on a shift
like this. <P>The bell above the door chimes, set to swinging as the black-framed
glass door is pushed open by a pink haired girl - curls spilling
across her shoulder, while half her face is hidden by a black woollen
scarf, which she is tugging free as she enters the caf&eacute;. 
The bell jingling in a
clearly audible fashion, designed to catch attention during the day
when the Schwarzenraben is likely to be quieter. In the evenings the
chances are the bell would go unheard, that night's guest DJ just
about drowning out all other sounds, and besides the place is abuzz
with activity, people and staff in constant motion, shifts which are
more fun and more stress. Gretchen watches the foursome take the two
steps from street level to the caf&eacute; floor, stamping snow from boots as
they do so, seeming to straighten up as though with the interior's
warmth a burden is removed from their shoulders. <P><div class=pullquote>When you have an eagle's
head, you are used to people staring</div>Tourists. Everything about them makes this fact clear to Gretchen. The
way they are dressed, and just the way that they look. This misfit
quartet are not from Berlin at all - the cut of the clothes, the brands,
the entire body language, marks them as 'other'. They look around,
appraising the layout of the caf&eacute;. There are tables along the two
opposing walls, until they reach the bar. Behind the bar, leading 
to a beer garden, there is a restaurant. In the middle of the front part
of the establishment there is a pillar island, the core surrounded by
a circle of tables. A variety of posters is stuck and layered
across the pillar's surface, in contrast to the precise black and
white illustrations framed at intervals along the walls. The caf&eacute; is
medium busy for a Wednesday afternoon. The girl with the wild pink
curls leads the group to the window seat away from the door. <P>Gretchen gets a vibe from this group. Something strange, and it is not
just the way the fourth member has stopped to look at her. A woman
with a hood over her head as well as the scarf covering her face, so
that only those intense eyes are visible. When you have an eagle's
head, you are used to people staring; this is different. The strange
woman nods to herself, and follows her friends. Gretchen glances at
Dana, Dana turns her back on the newcomers. Her lips curling in that
superior sneer-smile that riles Gretchen so much, twirling a finger in
her shoulder length hair like she doesn't have a care in the world,
with her elbows propped on the polished surface of the bar. Gretchen
can tell Dana is pretending to stare into space, but is actually
looking into the mirrors along the wall at the back of the bar.
Watching to see if anyone notices her. <P>Gretchen shrugs, gives herself a shake to release the tension that has
gathered while she stood around, straightening as she heads to the
window table. As she does so, she can feel the eyes following her. Her
particular kind of cosmetic surgery is still new, still
particularly radical. Deviant, some would say. Expensive work, and
more than Gretchen can afford. A combination of the latest
reconstructive techniques, coupled with cybernetics, and the
associated smart plastics. She wears her feathers with pride, holds
her eagle head high, and lets them look. Half way across the space,
the strange girl removes her hood. Removes her scarf. Gretchen doesn't
miss a step; while inside something does a flip. The dog-headed girl
looks back at her. <P>Gretchen stops at the table, "Guten tag."
"Hey," the pink haired girl says, the hint of a Scottish accent coming
through, even from that one word. Gretchen glances at the man, who it
is clear is wearing a cybernetic body, better than anything she has
seen before, making it most likely South American work, and at a guess
she would say Paraguayan, he nods at her. The Japanese girl is looking
out of the window, and Gretchen has the sense that she doesn't feel as if she
is as much of a part of the group as the other three. Sally Sally Dog
Girl leans forward, Gretchen recognises the singer. While she might
not know much about her music, there are sufficiently few
celebrity animalists that she has at least seen pictures of Sally
Sally and that Chinese cat supermodel. The dog girl reaches for
Gretchen's hand, takes it in her own. <P>"Hi, I'm Sally" <P>"Gretchen, hi." <P>"That is some damn fine work you have there," the dog girl grins,
admiring the eagle girl. <P>"Absolutely radical," the eagle girl replies to the dog girl. <P>The handshake lingers for a moment, and then they release, and resume
their r&ocirc;les. <P>"So. What can I get you?" <P>The pink haired girl hides a smile, bowing her head as she trails a
finger down the page of hot drinks on the menu, "I'll have a pot of
Earl Grey tea please," the warm accent more evident now than before. <P>"I'll take a beer, something local," the man says, his voice smooth,
synthetic, unplaceable. <P>"Green tea, please," the Japanese girl says, with a quick nod, and
quicker smile, her gaze wandering to Gretchen's eyes long enough to
place her order, and then back to the street, following the bustling
passage of people. <P>"I'll take a green tea as well, Gretchen," Sally's voice having a
certain growl. <i>Is it possible to place an accent from someone who has
had that kind of surgery, that kind of reconstruction, and even if you
could, could you rely on that impression?</i> Gretchen wonders, detecting
a hint of something Hispanic. This time, as Gretchen crosses the
space, not an eye follows her, attention has shifted to the new exotic
presence in their midst, an animalist, and one who has at least a
degree of fame, in certain circles. <P>Dana is paying attention now, glancing a tight scowl at Gretchen as
she potters about behind the bar, pulling together the order. A kettle
bubbles and clicks, transferred to 3 identical white pots, tea bags in
paper envelopes, extracted from boxes on wire stacked racks. A chilled
beer from the cabinet, a clean glass from a shelf. Gretchen balances
it all on a tray, carries it via another of Dana's scowls, a little
bemused by this unexpected turn of events, if she is honest with
herself.  She places the teas in front of each of the girls, the beer
in front of the man. They smile and thank her, she nods, clicks her
beak, and leaves them to drink. The sound of their conversations
lingering in her ear, as she walks as through a fog back to her safe
little spot by the bar. <P>The half hour that follows seems long and slow. She serves a few
customers, and is amused on occasion when Dana actually makes any
effort towards working - clattery and clumsy for all her careful
aloofness. Gretchen's attention drifts back, time and time again to
the tourists at that table, to the dog girl. Watching the strangers
and their chatter, occasionally Sally will meet her look, and then
they will nod a little, acknowledgement of some kind of animal
bond that exists between them, even if they have never met before this
day. <P>Gretchen counts the change from the 50 mark note that the pink haired
girl used to pay the bill, while Sally is rooting through her
jacket pockets, to produce a couple of slips of paper.
"Here," Sally says, handing the paper to Gretchen, so she can see that
they are tickets for a gig, "We are playing tonight, these are a
couple of tickets, I would like it if you were to come along." <P>"Thank you, I will try." Gretchen folds them, and slips them into the
back of her order pad, and glances back to see whether Dana is
watching, while Sally stands and pulls her jacket on. Gretchen steps
back to let the group leave, Sally touching her arm and squeezing
lightly as she departs.  Gretchen stands and watches them as they step
back into the street, crunching through the snow, Sally pulling up her
hood again, before taking the man's arm, and walking close beside him,
as they disappear around the corner. <P><p class=drop>Gretchen pulls her hood down as she takes the final step to their
third floor flat. Fumbling with the keys, she opens the door. Swings
the cloth bag with tonight's dinner on to the top of the hall cabinet.
Gretchen tugs the laces free, kicks her boots aside, and they clatter
against the wooden flooring. She runs her hands through her feathers,
a sensation she never gets tired of. She sighs, feeling the weight of
a day's fatigue sitting on her shoulders. She walks to the living
room, lazily dragging her sock-clad feet along the floorboards, in a
moment of self-amused self-indulgence. In the living room she boots up
the system, and selects the last <i>Children With Machine Guns</i> album,
having decided those spare melancholic melodies match her mood of the
moment. With the sound of "You don't like seagulls" entering the room,
she exits, into the bedroom. She strips off her uniform, pulls on
something casual, jeans, t-shirt, thick grey jumper. Living room,
hall, grabs bag of food, and into the kitchen to start making dinner,
humming to herself "These are the machine gun children of our
generation." <P>As Gretchen tips the last handful of chopped vegetables into the wok,
she hears the door to the flat opening, and listens to the sound of
someone come in, and, like she had before, kick off their shoes.
"I'm in the kitchen", she calls out. <P>"Ok", a man's voice replies, accompanied by the sound of the kitchen
door creaking open a degree. Gretchen doesn't turn from the wok,
stirring the food around with a plastic spoon. He slides his arms
around her, embracing her stomach, pressing against her back, brushing
his feathers against hers. She accommodates him, her head tipping a
degree to increase the sensation of her feathers against his. "Hello,
love," he murmurs to her, and her facial muscles shift, in what would
be a smile for a base human, the same hard-wired conscious motion, but
something a degree different for the girl with the eagle head. Within
his embrace she turns round, her eagle eyes look into his. She brings
a hand up, to run through his feathers, his dark, almost black, feathers in
contrast to the golden radiance of her own. <P>Gretchen has been married to Anders for three years now. He works for
the Berlin branch of the second biggest Chinese record label, which is
to say the second biggest record label in the world. He does quite
well, a fact that surprises them both, given that he started it as a summer
job all those years ago. A combination of luck and of being in the
right place at the right time have worked wonders. Though, never let
it be said that Anders is a slacker, he is someone who works hard for
his money and would hate to think someone thought otherwise.  Even if
with his eagle's head they think all kinds of other things about him. But, hell, it's the music industry,
and there is a fine tradition of eccentricity to be upheld.
Regardless, it is through the work Anders does that they were able to
afford the surgery at all - something they did for their honeymoon.
They checked into a Shanghai clinic, for the dozen operations, before
spending a couple of weeks together, recuperating and learning who
these new people were. Giving a human at least the appearance of
having an animal's head is, unsurprisingly, not a straightforward
process. Some aspects of the problem are obvious, others more subtle -
from how does someone with an eagle's head conduct human speech, to
what kind of proportions of each component are required so that the
end result, at least as far as the client is concerned, does not look
entirely absurd. In contrast to which the tattoos they got while
they were there seemed rather minor endeavours on the scale of things. <P>"Dinner will be ready in a second, if you give me a bit of space,"
Gretchen says, giving Anders a playful shove, turning back to stir the
sizzling vegetables. <P>"Ok, ok. You want me to open some wine to go with that?" Anders asks,
already taking two glasses from the cupboard. Gretchen turns to him,
her eyes flash, amused, and she nods to him. <P>"Yeah, that sounds good" <P>"I'm on it," Anders replies, laughing. <P>"So I see," Gretchen says, quietly, smiling to herself.	"Oh. Yeah..." she says after another moment. <P>"Oh, yeah, what?" Anders pauses, something in Gretchen's tone catching
his attention. <P>"Oh, yeah, give me a minute, and I'll tell you what happened to me today."
"Oh, yeah, you are a tease, and you know it!" <P>"Ha, yeah, I know that. But you love me for it!" <P>"I love you? Who told you that?" <P>"You did, stupid!" <P>"Oh well, I guess it must be true then," Anders says, laughing and shrugging. <P>Gretchen puts a plate on the table in front of him, another opposite
him. Anders hands her a pair of chopsticks, and sits
expectantly. He watches Gretchen take a mouthful of wine and clucks
mock exasperation as it looks as though she is about to eat without saying
anything else. "Well?" he taps his plate with his chopsticks, making a clacking
sound. Gretchen tilts her head, looks at him and shrugs, picks up a
chunk of pepper and raises it towards her mouth. <P>"Come on!" Anders moans. Gretchen sits back in the chair, and laughs,
dropping the pepper. <P>"Ok, ok. Keep your feathers on! Ok, so, you know that singer?" <P>"What singer?" <P>"Sally" <P>"Sally who?" <P>"The dog head Sally" <P>"Oh. Right. The singer." <P>"Yeah. The singer." <P>"From myslutsonfire. What about her?" <P>"She came into the bar today." <P>"What! No way?" <P>"Yeah" <P>"Wow" <P>"Yeah. It was a strange day" <P>"Wow" <P>"You said that already!" <P>Anders does the equivalent of a grin, and a what-can-I-say kind of
shrug, "I did. But you know, wow. I didn't even hear anything about
her being in the country." <P>"Well there she was, there was a group of them, an odd bunch, you
know?" Gretchen laughs, takes a bite of her food now, and chews. <P>"I bet. Tell me about the others?" <P>"There were the four of them altogether. Sally and two other girls -
one was Scottish, with this wild pink hair, and a quiet Japanese
girl." <P>"Hmm the Scot would be Kirsty Munro, don't know the other one, though
they do have a tendency to change the membership a lot, I get the
impression it's a pretty casual kind of idea." <P>"And then there was the guy, he had some heavy prosthetics, serious
cybernetic rebuild." <P>"Yeah, that would be Hugo. Sally, Kirsty and Hugo are the three core
members, always those three. Apparently they met in a Scotian Youth
Detention Centre, formed bonds that have kept them together ever
since." <P>"Scotia? That's some bad shit." <P>"Yeah, well, the war..." Anders leaves the sentence hanging there,
unfinished. The two eat in silence for a moment, lost in reflection.
World War Three was one Germany had sat out of, but they watched and
witnessed the aftermath as much as anyone. Europe, the World, was a
changed place now. <P>Gretchen finishes her glass of wine, and Anders refills it. When he
places the bottle back down again, she reaches for his hand, takes it
in her own and gives it a squeeze. She tilts her head one way, he
tilts his the other, and he squeezes her hand back. <P>"Anyway, the band are playing a gig tonight." <P>"They are?" <P>"Sally gave me two tickets, she asked me to come. You want to go along?" <P>Anders looks at his wife, chews on a piece of synthetic meat, and
holds her hand in his. "Such a funny old world," he mutters to himself. <P>"Pardon?" Gretchen asks. <P>"Yeah," he says ", lets go. Should be pretty fun." <P>"It seems like such a long time since we had a night out," she smiles
at him "Well, I guess I had better decide on what I am going to wear
then." <P>Gretchen throws the slight red top on the bed, confident that it will
expose her pierced belly button, and will show off the two small wings
she has tattooed across her shoulders. Then she selects a pair of
heavy, baggy cargo trousers, a warm, dark, burnt, brown colour, and
adds to those pile. Anders steps up behind her, slides his arms around
her, caressing his hands up her belly, beneath her jumper, up to her
breasts. She pulls her jumper and top off, over her head, and he pulls
him to her, their beaks opening, heads tilting in practiced motions as
their mouths meet in a kiss. Gretchen takes Anders' belt buckle in her
hand, and starts to loosen it, tugging it free. The pair strip, with
touches and kisses, beaks against beaks, tongues flicking from mouth
to mouth, till they are standing naked and eager. Gretchen takes his
hand in hers, and leads him to the shower, where they make love
together, slowly and passionately, and wetly. <P><p class=drop>Fresh snow falls, spinning white flakes like special effects stars in
a science fiction film. Disorientating as the silent train charges
through the dark, towards the more industrial areas of the city,
tilting from side to side with the invisible pathways of steel tracks.
The carriage lights set to a minimum, Gretchen
imagines the light as a slight humming sound, at the periphery of her
vision. The space itself is almost empty, one in a series of lonely
carriages, strung together, the only other people on board, going in
this direction, are a group of a half dozen kids. They create a quiet
buzz amongst themselves, mutters and whispers exchanged, as they pass
a cigarette between them, carefully and covertly trying to avoid
attention, their attitude restrained by the half-light, the time of
night, the presence of the odd couple at the other end. With the
ongoing fuel crisis - which refuses to be effectively met - regardless
of all the wonders of clean bio-fuels that have been developed in the
last decade - there is an ongoing effort towards conservation. As
such, industrial estates full of warehouses and factories, like the
one they can catch the ghost of outside the windows, where the venue
is, are kept dark at night, once the daily shifts are finished.
Gretchen and Anders have come prepared, both for the cold and for the
dark, stepping out of the train as it comes to a stop, out onto the
platform. They are wearing heavy jackets, the hoods up and scarves
across their faces to protect them from the weather, and minimise
unwanted attention. Cautiously crunching through the snow, feeling a
certain amount of ice mixed in with the white powder, their feet slide
momentarily and slightly, such that Gretchen reaches for Anders,
sliding her arm through his, they use each other for balance and
support as they make progress. The station has a minimum lighting, but
as they totter down the old wooden stairs down to street level,
Gretchen uses her free hand to hold onto the hand rail, while Anders
flicks on the beams of his torch - a long and heavy device, which
could readily double as a handy baton, should it come to that. It is
not that they expect trouble, especially not at this time of year with
the weather discouraging nocturnal expeditions, but in the dark areas
of cities crime happens, add to that their own peculiar and particular
appearances and they are prone to attract unwanted attention on
occasion. Crossing the road from the station Anders flashes his torch
up to the street sign screwed to the side of the flat grey expanse of
some nondescript warehouse building, to confirm their bearings, while
Gretchen retrieves her own torch and switches it on as well. <P>They do know this area, though not well, at each street corner they
have to double check their location, compare it to the hand drawn map
they made before they left the flat, a scribble of intersecting lines
and scrawled street names, like a jigsaw piece extracted leaving the
picture a mystery. They are looking for Werkhouse 4, an old warehouse
that went out of business some years ago and was converted into a club
venue, a building like all the others in this warren of business
spaces. As is often the case, the conversion from warehouse to
clubhouse was done on the cheap - money first, value second - a big open
space that might be suitable enough for groups of people, but was
never really designed for this type of gathering, let alone designed
with acoustics in mind. So it isn't entirely ideal, though to some
extent it is not as bad as it could have been, and they have seen some
good bands play here in the past, taking the available space the
promoters have offered, unaware or unconcerned by the problems the
space might present. Anders has suggested in the past that the way things
are in the world means that it really can't be easy for the bands of
today, which is certainly a factor in why tours from bands from so far
afield have become something of a rarity. Who has the funding for
that kind of thing, and where are the returns that make the whole
thing pay off? Though, certainly, local scenes flurry in the void,
with the same old crap and cream balance that there ever was, Berlin,
always a hot spot on the music map of the world, works at hyper speed
of flash and burn as talents rise and fall. <P>Along the way they pass gateways, chained closed; sharp rusted fences,
with barbed wire toppings; it is intensely quiet on this stretch; here
and there silent security guards stand behind these gates like
spectres, watching people like Anders and Gretchen wander past, large
dogs sitting by their feet, also watching, with lazy vigilance. One
last corner and they can tell that they have arrived, the change in
atmosphere - lights and sound, the appearance of groups of people.
There is a glow of lights, put out by the club owners, just off the
street, to attract attention and serve its customers. There is also a
murmur of sound, people flowing towards the venue, and a group of
people gathered by the roadside. Gretchen tenses against Anders, there
is something in the air, they both have their torches by their sides,
balanced, and pointed down towards the ground. As they get close
enough to hear some of the conversation the pair have an
idea of what is going on, the edges of tones, snatches of words. In
front of them protestors are challenging other people going to the
concert, handing them flyers, trying to discourage them from going on.
As they near it is clear that they are making little headway in this
context. <P>There are 
religious fanatics who feel that animalism is a step too far on the
scale of body modification, a step into sin, and a crime against God.
This kind of attitude is something that both Gretchen and Anders have
encountered before, something they knew to expect when they discussed
the operations and how it would affect their lives. However, when Anders
had talked about the body mods, having read about it in a magazine,
and showing her the photographs of a transformed Chinese supermodel, the
idea had got into her head and stuck. Anti-animalism is something they
would have preferred not to encounter tonight, though, Gretchen
reflects, given the nature of tonight's band, she supposes she
should not be surprised in any way. The people ahead shove their way
through the agitated crowd, accompanied by a chorus of "sinners!"
While half of the group are turning, having spied new people to
harangue, someone new to attempt to dissuade, a man steps forward,
balding head exposed to the cold, as though the black woollen hat held
in his clasped hands would detract from his sincerity. There is a
large, gold coloured, cross, pinned to the collar of his jacket,
glinting warnings in the bare available light. <P>"Comrades," he calls, with a false joviality, "please do not enter
here, for they encourage crimes against the human spirit, against
god!" <P>Anders takes a step to the side, away from the man and his friends,
Gretchen following as she still holds on to his arm, scanning faces
for signs of trouble, reading expressions on faces with each step. The
man leans towards Gretchen, an arm outstretched, it seems for a moment
that he is lunging, it seems for a moment that his face is filled with
aggression. Anders steps forward, trying to intercept the man's arm,
the protestor roars with a fury, turning on Anders with an aggression
that dislodges his scarf from in front of his face. The man staggers
back, sliding, and falling, his eyes transfixed by what he finds in
the hood, the bare beak exposed, feathers bristling, those inhuman
eyes piercing. <P>"Devils," a woman mutters in a voice edged with hysteria, and Gretchen
can't help but think it sounds so damned medieval, the fear of witches
and burnings turning in her stomach. She tightens her grip on
Anders, pulling him back, at the same time tightening her grip on the
solid barrel of her torch, bearing it with the clear intent of
protecting herself if needed. But it looks as though this group will fall
apart when faced by the very thing that they fear, dissent reaching a
murmuring pitch that puts distance between them. The fact that
Gretchen and Anders are both over six foot tall, and bear the mark of
such fierce predators, of course, contributes to the horror/fear that
the group are experiencing. Cautiously, but with confidence, the
couple step through the gate, into the small industrial estate.
They follow the path past a couple of other facilities, which are
currently locked up for the night. <P>"What madness!" Gretchen hears Anders mutter. <P>"Forget about it," Gretchen murmurs to him. <P>Outside the entrance to Werkhouse 4, where a number of people are
lined up, waiting to get inside, there are more lights. They join the
line, with Gretchen digging the tickets from her jacket pocket,
clutching them in her hand, as though she might lose them or as though
they might suddenly vanish. One of those particularly large men who
inevitably end up in that kind of job, stands by the door, a massive
bouncer. In addition to the intimidating sense of his size is
the fact that he is animalist as well. With a bear's head on those
shoulders you could be forgiven for thinking he was a real live bear,
in a suit, a suit which looks strained with his bulk. Sniffing the air,
and blinking beady eyes, the bear is glancing about, while a smaller,
more human bouncer is filtering people past him, and through the
ticket desk. Gretchen is watching the bear with curiosity. When he
catches her eye, he, in turn, takes her in, looking the pair of them up
and down, seeing the tickets in her hand. <P>"You got tickets?" he growls, wobbling his way towards them, Gretchen
finds that she is resisting taking a step away from him.
"How you get tickets? No-one have ticket? Is secret. People pay here." <P>"Sally gave them to me," Gretchen shrugs, flashing the tickets in
front of him, "This afternoon." <P>The bear peers at them, shrugs idly, mirroring her motion
unconsciously, waves them forward, "Ok. You come, go in now." <P>Gretchen grabs Anders' hand and pulls him after her. "Come on!" <P>The bear ambles back to the doorway, with the pair close behind; he
points into the corridor, "Show girl tickets." Then with a grunt turns
away, his small intense eyes going back to scanning the world as
though it were all a novelty. The bored girl at the ticket desk looks
at them with disinterest, twiddling one of the pieces of metal that
ornament her face in an idle fashion, thumb and forefinger rotating
stud, tugging lip into deformed pout. With all the time in the world, the girl takes the tickets from
Gretchen's hand, tears a strip from them, which she drops on to the
table, and wafts the tickets back in their direction, then with a
barely suggestive motion shrugs in a way that perhaps translates
"Please enter, and enjoy your evening." At least that is how Gretchen
interprets the motion, and she strolls past the ticket desk and
along the narrow white corridor towards the main hall. The level of
noise already forms the impression of solidity, which makes her
blink up her implant menu and turn on the smart filters that will
control her hearing for the evening. No point in going deaf when you
have a simple blink to trigger the appliance of science that goes hand
in hand with their kind of body modification. <P>Thick black strips of plastic hang across the doorway. Gretchen uses
her whole arm to physically separate them, and push through into the
large square space behind. There are a handful of people there
already, enough to make the place look big and empty. Hanging above
the stage there are three half naked men, heavily tattooed, and
bleeding. Each has a series of polished hooks through the meat of
their chests, attached to thick wire, holding them in space, slow
spinning motions as they float artificially in space. Gretchen has
seen pictures of suspensions before, but this is the first time she
has seen it in the flesh. She feels that she can appreciate aspects of
the idea; she too would like to fly, to lift her feet from the ground
and rise up. But she can't entirely see past those gruesome hooks
and knows that in that sense it is a trick, though, she understands,
that isn't entirely the idea behind suspension anyway, as the blood
trickles and thickens it provides her with a firm distraction from any
suggested ideal. Anders stands and watches the men, rotating slightly
one way, lightly spinning back. He shrugs. <P>"So, how about a drink?" he asks Gretchen. <P>
"Sounds good. I'll have a beer." <P>"You waiting here?" he asks, glancing once more at the ornamental people. <P>"Nah, I'll come through with you." <P><p class=drop>The lights dip and there is a sudden accompanying hush of expectation,
Gretchen nudging Anders as she smiles and anticipates, takes another
swig from her bottle. There is a low droning sound that starts to
build by increments. An expanding bass spiral, carefully controlled
progression, notes layering into the original to create a dense
vibrancy that becomes a charged wall of sound. The pink haired girl
walks on stage, Kirsty, Anders had called her. She is playing
bagpipes, and Gretchen guesses this is where the original sound has
come from, though the layering suggests some electronic sampling and
manipulation. Hugo, the cybernetic, comes on stage, placing a couple
of black boxes with flashing lights beside all the other black boxes
with flashing lights that mean nothing to Gretchen, that are all
stacked on a table at the back of the stage. The crowd around them
starts to become restless, a growing mutter, energy building in an
infectious manner. Emerging from the wall of sound, Gretchen can now
hear a dog howling, a deep and intimidating sound. Sally Sally storms
on to the stage - she is wearing a lot less than she was in the caf&eacute;
this afternoon. A chunky pair of beat-up army boots. A short tartan
skirt. And a plain black vest top, slight enough to show her bare
belly - a tattoo of a running dog across her stomach, a thick black
tribal thing that seems alive with her motion. Light brown arms and
legs, and that big black dog's head. Alive and animal, pacing the
stage, barking into the microphone. Gretchen is hit by a wave of lust
for life, for running free and the crowd are starting to go wild
around her. Beats kick in,  hard, shifting the atmosphere abruptly to
a more abrasive dance scene, though the other layers remain now
tainted. <P>"Are you listening?" Sally Sally speaks, "Are you?" <P>"The future's voices, past and present talking to you." <P>"Voices in the air." Vocals filtering through effects, and echoes. <P>"Water, earth, fire" <P>"Are you listening?" <P>A voice calls from the audience, "Yeah, we can hear you bitch, get on with it."
A couple of other voices call out from the same area, tinged with a
hard tone that goes beyond regular drunken heckling "Bitch!"
Sally Sally ignores the voices as she starts to sing the body of the
first song. The combination of all the sound and mixed energy in the
room makes Gretchen dizzy for a moment <P>There are more antagonistic shouts, accompanied by some shouting back,
an increasing turn in the language being used that reveals the agenda
of those who are instigating trouble - hate words, anti-animalist
words. There is a jostling in the crowd, Gretchen feels as though she
is being shoved back and forth. Anders takes her hand, and she can
tell he is starting to feel as defensive as she is, the negativity
coming from certain quarters is unsettling and disturbing in an
atmosphere that is already so charged. Gretchen has the sense that
violence is imminent, it can only be a matter of time before something
gets out of control. There is a great roar and Sally Sally is leaping
from the stage in the direction of the shouting. She lands on a man,
knees first, in a move that seems like something Gretchen saw in a
film that had Thai kick boxing in it. <P>"Come on!" she shouts at Anders, and before either of them know what
is going on, Gretchen is dragging them in Sally Sally's direction.
Sally Sally is struggling to bite the man she has knocked over,
snarling and snapping in lunging motions, while a couple of other
guys are trying to get a hold on her to drag her off. But she is feral
and resisting all attempts to stop her with a ferocious animalist
energy. Things are getting out of order and while Gretchen feels that
there is something entirely absurd about the whole situation she is
filled with a quick sharp fury. Gretchen kicks one of the men who has
just dragged Sally Sally off her target, a great lashing boot that
sends the man to his knees howling with pain. Anders slams into the
other guy, hitting him, so that before they know it the pair are in
the midst of a brawl. There are a dozen or so guys that are clearly
together and looking to get involved in the trouble, fighting Sally
Sally and a number of other audience members. A man shoves at
Gretchen, pulling a knife from a pocket, a folding thing. 
With a quick flick the blade clicks into place, and he lunges at her; 
with a spike of panic she falls back, scrabbling to get away, 
but space is limited and she is afraid that stabbing her will become pretty easy. 
The crowd shifts again, and
Gretchen is pushed forward, feeling a sickening inevitability churn in
her stomach, toward the blade, then just as quickly she finds herself
moving sideways, a roaring filling her ears, and sees a look of
terror in the man's eyes, before she is herself spun about. She
watches as a great paw of a hand flies past her face, catching the
man's wrist and twisting, brutal and hard, the knife slips out from
the fingers and the man's face is transformed by pain, spittle
slapping his cheeks as that great bear mouth roars at him. Whether he
was moving to save Gretchen or not, she can't be sure, but the current
result is the important thing. Hands grab her shoulder and pull her
round into an embrace, she finds Anders holding on to her "This is
madness," he cries in her ear, "Are you ok?" <P>Gretchen lets him hold her, "Yeah, I'm fine." <P>More bouncers arrive, so that the tide of things is turned against the
troublemakers, and it is not long before they are ejected in a
decisive and forceful manner. Gretchen feels spun around as things now
go from the slow motion of moments before to a high speed fast forward
style of reality. <P>"Sorry about that!" a voice calls from the stage, Gretchen turning to
find that Sally Sally and the band are back up there and ready to get
on with the gig, "This kind of thing doesn't happen every night!" <P>"No, just every 5th or 6th night," laughs Kirsty, picking up a guitar
from the back of the stage. As she plugs it in, Midori starts to play
the bass. Soon the two of them are playing and the sound mixes with
Hugo's electronics until myslutsonfire are building the sound back up
once more. But this time the sound is more charged, Gretchen feels
dazed, and like many she feels the greater undercurrent of aggression
that comes through now. This has turned into a much stranger night
than Gretchen had expected. Anders squeezes her, his hands on her
waist, his head brushes against hers, feathers against feathers,
saying into her ear, "This has turned into a much stranger night than
I expected." <P>"That's just what I was thinking," Gretchen replies, laughing. <P>The crowd moves, captivated by the energy of the music and the
violence now past, and despite herself, Gretchen finds that she is
dancing. They are all dancing, bodies in tune to music, stomping and
swaying, crushing against each other. They howl with Sally Sally,
visceral vocal discharges.  <P>The night comes to an end suddenly, it seems to
Gretchen, who, like the rest of the audience, finds herself suddenly
standing still and exhausted. There is something primal and liberating 
in the way that they find themselves standing now, grunting with 
heavy breath and drenched in sweat. <P>Outside, in the street, back in the momentarily forgotten snow,
Gretchen stands, staring into this deep, dark December sky. This is
the time where you can feel anti-climax, like you came, you saw and it
ended, and what was it all worth? Gretchen feels the other way, though,
charged, and enthused, like life is a wonderful thing and it is great
to be alive right now, right here. Looking at the tiny stars, glinting
and winking above, describing odd patterns for myths to be read into.
A star moves, shifting as it describes an arc across the darkness, the
flash, flash, flash of a spy satellite, capturing this moment forever.
Oh for a copy of that picture - a girl on earth, a black dot against
white street, filled  with happiness, looking at the stars. Anders
catches up with her, puts a hand on her shoulder, and she leans into
him, and he holds her against his chest for a long moment. He kisses
her cheek, brushing his hand across her back, "You ok?" <P>She turns to him, and kisses him fully, "Yeah."	He takes her hand in his, and leads Gretchen back in the
direction of the train station. <P>"So, did you enjoy yourself?" Anders asks her. <P>"Oh yes!" she says squeezing his hand in hers. <P>"You did?" he asks, teasing a little, laughing a little.
"Wow."   <P> <P><small>&copy; Peter Morrison 2008 All Rights Reserved </small>
