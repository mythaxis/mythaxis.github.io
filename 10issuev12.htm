<p class="drop">Taig brushed driven snow from the sign
before stepping back and reading aloud. &quot;This is a Clear Conscience
zone. No criminal acts can be performed.&quot; He turned to Floyd.
&quot;You sure that gizmo of yours is still working? I didn&#146;t come this
far only to turn myself in &#145;cos it&#146;s the right thing to do.&quot;  <P>Floyd shrugged, the gesture almost lost beneath the two overcoats he was
wearing against the biting wind. &quot;Don&#146;t sweat it. This heightened
sense of right and wrong is a mere slap on the wrist compared to the
full-blown justice field back on Harris Island. We&#146;ll be able to move
further from my &#145;gizmo&#146;, as you call it, but no more than fifty yards to
be on the safe side.&quot; <P>Alice shivered. &quot;Then bloody well turn it on and let&#146;s find
someplace warm. I&#146;m sick of the cold.&quot; <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much. <P>Floyd reached into the bag slung across his chest and I heard the soft
<I>thrum</I> of unshielded electronics. He was a genius, but should have
been in an institute for the criminally insane rather than the Harris
Island Correctional Facility. However, the authorities were so intent on
proving the justice field could cope with <I>anyone</I> that he&#146;d been
shipped in amidst intense media coverage. <P>And for a while he&#146;d seemed like the model prisoner; placid, courteous
and socially responsible. They&#146;d made use of his talents in the
technical recycling department, stripping redundant equipment of usable
parts and melting down the rest. <P>Man, was <I>that</I> a mistake.&#9; <P>Somehow he managed to cobble together a blank-box from scrap without
infringing his new-found sense of what constituted criminal behaviour.
Harris Island didn&#146;t have walls, or even guards. You didn&#146;t need them
when the inmates <I>knew</I> they should be in prison and remained there
of their own volition. Floyd&#146;s gizmo negated the justice field over a
radius of ten feet, far enough to include the four of us. <P>The wind howled around us, kicking up frosted snowflakes that stung any
exposed flesh like nettles. Although the weather had let up, the leaden
skies made for less than ideal flying conditions. We had to find cover
before Justice Department drones started scouring the landscape for a
group containing two of their &#145;most wanted&#146;.   <P>Alice strode beyond the sign and turned, hand on hip. &quot;Are we
making a move or what? You brought us all the way out here and I&#146;m still
waiting to see the benefit of sticking together.&quot; <P>Floyd put on his patient voice. &quot;It needed four of us to handle the
heavy rowboat and we needed a non-threatening woman to knock on the
first door we came to. Our little home invasion will no doubt have been
discovered by now, so we need a <I>change</I> of clothes if we&#146;re to
blend in on reaching the city.&quot; <P>Taig glowered at him. &quot;Yeah, but Fairview? A gated community?
High-end means high-risk in my book.&quot; <P>&quot;But with restricted access only on the landward side, Taig.&quot;
Floyd started walking, a peculiar high-stepping gait as if the snow was
somehow contaminated. &quot;Plus, being out of season, residences on the
peninsula will be closed down for the most part.&quot; <P>&quot;Like that one?&quot; Alice stood on the crest of a slight incline,
pointing down the slope beyond. <P>The three of us joined her. Floyd nodded. &quot;Like that one.&quot; <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much. <P>It was a large house in the neo-colonial style but obviously newly
built. The driveway was a sweep of white, unsullied by tyre marks or
footprints. Evergreens shielded it from neighbouring residences, with
the only open vista being the direction we were approaching from. <P>Taig sounded dubious. &quot;Turning over that place back-a-ways was one
thing, but somewhere this big is bound to have alarms, motion sensors,
the works.&quot; <P>Floyd sighed. &quot;No, Taig, it won&#146;t. The owner doesn&#146;t need a
security system because no criminal acts can be performed here,
remember? We can just stroll up and force entry. Hell, the place might
even be unlocked.&quot; <P>So we struggled, rather than strolled, through the snow and round to the
back door. Taig went to kick the lock in but Floyd raised a hand.
&quot;Wait! Now, listen up. There will be some kind of computerised
housekeeping system. Maybe an A-I, but more likely just smart
environmental controls. It will be in hibernation mode, meaning we can&#146;t
do anything that might trigger an alert. So, no temperature variations,
in fact no use of utilities whatsoever.&quot; <P>Alice frowned. &quot;No temperature variations? You mean we can&#146;t turn
the heating up? Shit.&quot; <P>&quot;Exactly. No using the cooker either, or running the taps. There&#146;s
bound to be an open fire we can light though, and if we need water then
put some snow in a pan.&quot; <P>Taig put his elbow through a small glass door panel. &quot;You&#146;re saying
that if I take a dump I can&#146;t flush?&quot; <P>Our genius inclined his head. &quot;Regrettably, yes. However in a place
of this size there are sure to be multiple restrooms, more than enough
to go round for the limited time we&#146;ll be here.&quot; <P>&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Taig reached in, unlocked the door and closed it
behind us once we were all inside. He peeled off the shawl around his
neck and stuffed it into the empty frame.  <P>Alice shed her outer layers. &quot;What about food? If you say we can&#146;t
eat anything then I&#146;ll have your arm off, Floyd, I swear to God.&quot; <P>He smiled. &quot;No, no, that will be fine. Just don&#146;t put any used
cartons or cans in the trash, in case they have microtags for automated
reordering. Other than that, feel free to make use of whatever you can
find.&quot; <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much. <P>Floyd placed his gizmo in the living room and we split up. I hit the kitchen
for some crackers and cheese while Taig smashed up the dining room
chairs to serve as firewood. Once he had it going, Alice came over all
domestic goddess and emptied cans of soup into a big pot. They wedged it
in place over the fire using a poker, although by the looks of things it
would take ages to reach anything like warm. I don&#146;t know what Floyd was
doing, probably hacking the house computer and bringing down some
international banking system. That&#146;s what he was good at. <P>I found a bedroom on the second floor complete with <i>en suite</i> 
facilities. After
cleaning up &#150; and remembering not to flush &#150; I raked around for more
suitable clothes than my HICF jumpsuit and stolen outerwear. One of the
dudes who hung out here was a size or so larger than me, but that loose
fit was back in vogue &#150; I watch a lot of TV. I even dry-shaved as
stubble didn&#146;t sit well with the herringbone three-piece suit I went
for. <P>The four of us reassembled in the lounge to try Alice&#146;s
tomato-chicken-pea fusion soup. At least it was hot. She had scored some
classy threads and really looked the part, like she belonged in these
surroundings. Taig, well, Taig was just a brute in an ill-fitting suit.
Floyd had gone for pants and open-necked shirt, with a sweater knotted
casually around his shoulders. There was a slightly crazed smile on his
lips that didn&#146;t bode well. <P>Floyd set his plate aside. &quot;I kept us together to minimise the risk
of being spotted and I think you&#146;ll agree I&#146;ve done a good job up to
this point. However, now we have to split up. The authorities will be
looking for a group of four, or four individuals, so I suggest we head
out as couples. I&#146;ll go with Alice, naturally, while you two boys will
have to make like a gay couple enjoying a winter break.&quot; <P>Taig sneered at him. &quot;What do you mean, &#145;naturally&#146;. I&#146;m the kind
of guy who would have a doll like Alice on his arm, not you.&quot; <P>Floyd arched an eyebrow. &quot;Really? I wouldn&#146;t put you together
unless it was some kind of car-parking scenario, or maybe carrying her
groceries out of the supermarket.&quot; <P>Taig stood, flexing his powerful shoulders in a way that put his new
suit under considerable strain. &quot;Everyone says how you&#146;re so smart,
a regular genius. Well, you got us out, and you got us here, but all
those brains don&#146;t count for nothing now, understand? I was a drug
dealer, started on street corners and climbed up by doing what the other
guy wouldn&#146;t. I put guys in hospital, put them in the ground, but I got
smarts as well, savvy?&quot; He tapped the side of his head. <P>Floyd sneered at him. &quot;Oh, I get you, a regular Keyzer Soze. Most
impressive.&quot; <P>&quot;Who&#146;s he?&quot; <P>&quot;Never mind. The point is, Taig, that you and simply Alice don&#146;t
fit together. You&#146;re trash and always will be. At least she&#146;s acquired a
veneer of sophistication through high-end prostitution.&quot; <P>Alice snorted. &quot;Gee, thanks! And don&#146;t I get a say in all this?
What about silent-boy here? Parker?&quot; <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much. <P>Floyd dismissed me with a wave of his hand. &quot;Impossible. I don&#146;t
know why he was incarcerated at Harris Island but he more properly
belongs in a mental institution.&quot; <P>&quot;You&#146;re a fine one to talk.&quot; <P>&quot;Thank you, Alice, that will be enough. At least Parker knows how
to follow orders and keep his mouth shut. Behaviour you&#146;d be wise to
emulate, Taig.&quot; <P>Taig hit him, straight fingers to the throat. Floyd staggered back,
choking, disbelief plain upon his face. Taig lifted a chair leg and
struck Floyd about the face as he sank to his knees and fell over. <P>For a moment the only sounds were Taig&#146;s heavy breathing and the
cracking fire. Then he turned to me, brandishing the bloody length of
wood. &quot;You step out of line, you get the same.&quot; <P>Alice looked between the two of us. &quot;Aren&#146;t you going to warn
him?&quot; <P>Taig frowned at her. &quot;Warn him? I just did.&quot; <P>She sighed. &quot;Not you, numbnuts, Parker.&quot; <P>I kicked the poker into the air, grabbed the handle and thrust the
glowing point up into Taig&#146;s abdomen. All the way in, until the red-hot
metal reached his heart. I stepped back as he stood there swaying,
staring at me open-mouthed. The chair leg fell from his hand. <P>Alice smiled. &quot;He&#146;s a serial killer, Taig. The &#145;Monday Morning
Murderer&#146; they called him. I recognised Parker straight off as most of
his victims were call-girls, but I hoped he&#146;d get rid of you as
well.&quot; <P>Taig toppled backwards like a falling log. He lay still on the carpet,
sizzling slightly. <P>Alice took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eye. &quot;Now
what? Are you going to kill me as well?&quot; <P>I shook my head. &quot;Until Floyd showed up I was slated to be the star
attraction at Harris Island. A violent psychopath, tamed by the justice
field generator. That was all a lie, though. I have an imbedded impulse
controller, like an enforced conscience, to keep me from re-offending. I
was safe to walk the streets but they wanted a high-profile inmate to
show the broadcast technology worked.&quot; <P>&quot;So you can speak, after all. But Floyd&#146;s blank-box, how&#133;?&quot; <P>&quot;The interference from the blank-box reset my controller to its factory
specifications, before any kind of ethical parameters were programmed
in. So now I&#146;m a functioning sociopath rather than psychopath, although
society may not consider that much of an improvement. I could have
walked into the Clear Conscience zone without Jiminy Cricket popping up
on my shoulder, and I can walk out just as easily.&quot; <P>Alice folded her arms. &quot;On your own?&quot; <P>&quot;On my own. I&#146;ll leave you the gizmo but I don&#146;t play well with
others. The private security who guard this place are more concerned
with keeping people out, so they&#146;ll probably just wave you through.
There&#146;s a car in the garage you could use, if walking seems a bit out of
character for someone who lives here. You might get past the gate before
the LoJack kicks in, but in any event don&#146;t push your luck.&quot; <P>&quot;But you intend to just stroll out?&quot; <P>I extended one foot. &quot;Walking boots. Obviously someone who lives
here isn&#146;t averse to healthy exercise so I&#146;ll just trade on the
precedent. And if anyone tries to stop me I&#146;ll kill them.&quot; <P>&quot;Just like that?&quot; <P>I nodded. &quot;Just like that. The hardware in my head makes me immune
to all ethical and moral restraints, just as it suppresses any homicidal
impulses. I can kill, or just as easily not kill, as the situation
demands. I&#146;m truly indifferent&#133;Goodbye, Alice.&quot; <P>&quot;Bye, Parker.&quot; <P>I turned away, my voice hoarse from so much use. There was a long
overcoat hanging by the back door and I took that, although it was too
snug to fasten over my suit. I also took a long-bladed kitchen knife
from the block, just in case. I walked down the drive and headed for the
main road, passing several other residences which appeared closed for
the winter.  <P>It took me the best part of twenty minutes to reach the main gate with
its guardhouse and single occupant. He was leafing through a girly
magazine in front of a battery of CCTV monitors, all showing sections of
the perimeter wall. I rapped on the glass door and he started, jumping
up and fumbling his cap into place before answering.   <P>&quot;Sorry, sir, just catching up on some, ah, technical manuals.
Walking into town? Well, at least the snow is supposed to hold
off.&quot; He pressed a button and the pedestrian gate swung open. The
guard hesitated and I gripped the handle of my knife. &quot;I saw the
chimney smoke, sir, but the previous guard didn&#146;t inform me the property
was in use. I&#146;ll make sure you&#146;ll be expected back, don&#146;t you
worry.&quot; I let the silence drag out. He touched his cap. &quot;Good
day to you, sir.&quot; <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much.
  
At the bottom of the approach road, where it joined the highway, was a
forlorn bus stop. Well, the hired help for the big houses had to get out
here somehow. The timetable screen lit up as it sensed my approach, but
there wasn&#146;t a service going anywhere for hours. Just hanging about
wasn&#146;t an option, for obvious reasons, so I started walking towards the
city.  <P>After a few hundred yards I heard a car engine approaching from behind.
Glancing round I expected it to be Alice in the stolen four-by-four, but
instead, a neat roadster pulled up beside me. The soft top was down, but
it looked more like mechanical dilapidation than stylistic verve. The
driver was a young woman wearing a fur coat and last night's makeup.  <P>She smiled. &quot;Need a lift as far as a coffee shop?&quot; <P>I slid in beside her, noting the short dress and folded red parasol on
the parcel shelf. My hands twitched. &quot;You&#146;re a whore.&quot; <P>&quot;Ouch! And hello to you too, mister. Despite the clothes, it&#146;s
obvious you don&#146;t belong here, same as me. So less of the attitude or
you can freeze your ass off walking to the Metro.&quot; <P>&quot;Merely an observation.&quot; <P>We pulled away, fishtailing in the slush. &quot;Well, for your
information, I&#146;m an escort, a paid companion, and <I>that&#146;s</I>
completely legal. Anything else which may have occurred was spontaneous
sex between two consenting adults.&quot; <P>I shrugged. &quot;I know the correct form of words.&quot; <P>The woman shot me a sideways glance. &quot;I bet. So what are you then,
a gigolo? I&#146;m not getting a rent boy vibe.&quot;  <P>The road was an empty avenue between rows of pine trees. I shivered
slightly, but not because of the cold. &quot;It&#146;s not who we are that
defines us, but what we do. That can change from day to day, from hour
to hour. All that matters is the thought and the deed.&quot; <P>&quot;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&quot; <P>In that moment I was my own creation, slave to neither impulse nor
expectation. If I killed it was a conscious decision to fashion reality
in my image. &quot;Pull over, I need to explain myself. My name is
Parker.&quot; <P>She frowned at me. &quot;Well, Parker, I&#146;m Rachel. I&#146;ll pull over, but
you better have a damn good story to tell.&quot; The car slithered to a
halt. <P>I said nothing. I don&#146;t talk much.   <P>
