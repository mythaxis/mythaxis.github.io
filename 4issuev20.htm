<div><i><b>&#147;We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough
men stand ready to do violence on our behalf"</b><br>George Orwell</i>
<p class=drop>&#147;Burn them!&#148;</p> <P><p>I looked up, alerted by the obvious stress in Captain Memphre&#146;s
voice. He stood at the forward view screen, silhouetted against the
blue-green planet, gripping the guard rail so tight his knuckles had
turned white. The south pole of Jetter lay beneath us &#150; a planet home to
some nine-hundred thousand unsuspecting colonists. </p> <P><p>Use of the stellar convertor had to be authorised by two senior
officers. However Commander Lutyens was in an induced coma &#150; being
treated for Taig Parasites &#150; and Sub-Commander Devon was on
compassionate leave following the sudden death of his wife. By rights we
should have returned to Cathay Station to take on replacements, but the
Admiralty were keen to see their new toy in action. That left me, a mere
lieutenant, as acting Executive Officer aboard the experimental
terraformer <i>Vulcan</i>.</p> <P><p>I was known as a man who obeyed orders, who followed the chain of
command. Without hesitation I moved to the control console and placed my
right palm on the recognition scanner, causing the access panel to
retract. Rotating the revealed T-piece handle through one-eighty degrees
engaged the pre-ignition sequence. </p> <P><p>Memphre strode towards me, his voice distorted by fury. &#147;I said burn
them, Keppler! Burn them <i>now!</i>&#148; He slapped his hand down on the
second recognition panel.</p> <P><p><i>&#147;Warning, thermostellar primer system is now operational.&#148;</i></p> <P><p>&#147;Awaiting full power, sir.&#148; I was conscious of the other bridge
personnel staring at me, but no-one said anything. My board went green.
&#147;Capacitors charged. Firing in three, two, one&#133;&#148; I pulled the T-piece
down and pushed home. A cobalt-blue beam lanced from our bow, causing
the view screen to polarize. It seemed to take an eternity as Jetter
wasn&#146;t an ideal target for conversion, but in reality it was less than a
minute. The beam shut down, leaving a black after-image on my
retinas.</p> <P><p>&#147;Energisation cycle complete, Captain.&#148; </p> <P><p>He made no reply, staring at the pink hue now spreading through the
ionosphere. We had only a few moments to get clear but he seemed lost in
his own private world. </p> <P><p>I raised my voice slightly. &#147;Helm, full astern.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Helm answering full astern, sir.&#148; Banks sounded relieved to be
receiving orders from someone, anyone.</p> <P><p>I cleared my throat. &#147;Captain Memphre?&#148; He continued to ignore me.
The planet began to glow, changing from pink to pearl-white. &#147;Captain, I
must protect the bridge against the anticipated radiation surge.&#148; Still
he stood there, quivering, like a statue hewn from anguish. I brought
down the heavy view-port blast shields, shutting out the rapidly
increasing glare.</p> <P><p>Abruptly Memphre turned on his heel and hurried from the bridge. His
face was pinched, as if in great pain, and there were obvious sweat
stains soiling his uniform. After the door closed behind him no one
spoke for a long moment. </p> <P><p>I stood and walked over to the command chair, but did not sit down.
&#147;As senior officer present I will take the con. Miss King, kindly note
this in the log. Also inform Medical that the Captain is, ah, indisposed
and that Commander Lutyens must be revived immediately.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Sir.&#148;</p> <P><p>The Captain hadn&#146;t explained why we&#146;d altered course to Jetter and
no-one on board had questioned his decision. Everyone knew him to be a
loyal and dependable officer, if a tad staid. Although his fitness for
command had to be questioned I knew the other officers would accept	only
Lutyens as his replacement. </p> <P><p>My fingers tapped out a two-two rhythm on the chair back. &#147;Mister
Harris. Sensor readings?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Stellar ignition confirmed, <i>Lieutenant</i>.&#148; Sub-Lieutenant
Harris didn&#146;t sound at all happy. &#147;This is now officially a binary star
system and everyone on the former planet is dead.&#148;</p> <P><p>I nodded, betraying no emotion. &#147;Any survivors elsewhere?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;None detected. There was no asteroid mining, no outposts on other
planets or Jetter&#146;s moons. It was a world of no strategic value.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Are we clear of the estimated corona?&#148;</p> <P><p>Harris shrugged. &#147;Probably, but it hardly matters. You do realise our
careers are finished? You do realise we&#146;ve just murdered nine-hundred
thousand people?&#148;</p> <P><p>I ignored him. &#147;Navigation, I want the nearest uninhabited location
from where we can re-establish contact with the Admiralty.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Sir, I have the next scheduled waypoint still queued up. A
type-seven asteroid, flight time five hours.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Lay in the co-ordinates. Helm, get us out of here immediately your
board is green.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Alignment&#133;.complete. Jumping to hyperspace in three, two, one&#133;&#148;</p> <P><p>I experienced that all-too-familiar nausea as <i>Vulcan</i> exited
the real universe. I sat down, although the command chair made me feel
awkward, an imposter. No one spoke. I busied myself tidying up a few
security loose ends until the end of watch, when Reynolds relieved me.
He appeared hesitant, almost fearful of assuming command, so I guessed
word of what had  happened had already spread throughout the ship. </p> <P><p>I retreated to my cabin, threw myself down on the bulk fully clothed,
and slept.</p> <P><p class=drop>Seven hours later I arose, showered, shaved and donned a
fresh uniform. Silence greeted me as I entered the Wardroom, and none
of my fellow officers would look me in the eye. To spare them any
embarrassment I sat alone as the orderly served me breakfast. I tried to
tune out the background murmur of conversation in case my name cropped
up, instead concentrating on my pad and the schedule of forthcoming
tasks.</p> <P><p>A shadow fell across my table and I looked up to see Master Sergeant
Deluca and two Marines, all sporting sidearms. He saluted. &#147;Lieutenant
Keppler, Acting-Captain Lutyens wishes to see you in his quarters. That
would be immediately, sir.&#148;</p> <P><p>I dapped my lips with a napkin and stood. &#147;Of course, Top, I
understand.&#148;</p> <P><p>Deluca led the way with the two Marines following close behind.
Although the title &#145;Acting-Captain&#146; indicated events had moved ahead
while I&#146;d been asleep, the situation caused me no concern. The Marines
remained on guard outside the Captain&#146;s quarters while Deluca knocked
and ushered me inside.</p> <P><p>Lutyens had installed himself behind Memphre&#146;s antique wooden desk,
which had been swept clear of all personal items and mementos. The
acting-captain looked ghastly. Taig Parasites produced a form of
unbearable neuralgia which required the patient to be placed in an
induced coma. Quite how Lutyens had become infected remained a mystery.
He was clearly still suffering; the right side of his body twitched
spasmodically despite the line of derms plastered to his jugular. The
man was mainlining painkillers and I wondered
how badly they&#146;d affected his judgment.</p> <P><p>Both Deluca and I stopped the regulation three paces in front of his
desk and saluted. Lutyens ignored the formalities. &#147;Captain Memphre is
dead. He shot himself in the shower.&#148; His eyes flicked to the restroom
door and back to me. &#147;Medical can&#146;t tell if he suffered some kind of
mental breakdown or was exposed to a psychotropic drug. It hardly
matters now.&#148;</p> <P><p>I cleared my throat. &#147;Sir, I-&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Silence!&#148; Lutyens wiped his mouth with a hand that trembled. &#147;I&#146;ve
been in communication with the Admiralty and they&#146;ve placed me in
temporary command. Needless to say our terraforming mission has been
aborted and we&#146;re returning to Cathay Station under escort once the
cruiser Pericles joins us. Consider yourself under arrest, Keppler.
You&#146;ll be confined to quarters for the remainder of the voyage, pending
formal charges.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Charges, sir?&#148;</p> <P><p>Lutyens had never liked me and managed a thin-lipped smile despite
his obvious pain. &#147;Obeying an illegal order. Crimes against humanity.
For starters.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Sir, with respect, neither of those offences are recognised as such
by the Naval Judiciary.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;<i>Silence!</i> Good God, man, this ship wiped out almost a million
colonists, an entire planet. Didn&#146;t you realise Captain Memphre had
taken leave of his senses?&#148; </p> <P><p>I drew myself up. &#147;Sir, I was following the direct orders of my
superior officer.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;You&#146;re a bloody martinet, Keppler, a mere functionary, but that
won&#146;t save you.&#148; He sat back. &#147;You&#146;ve no friends on board as far as I&#146;m
aware, so don&#146;t expect anyone to speak up on your behalf.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Very well, sir, but I look forward to standing before a
court-martial and defending myself against-&#148;</p> <P><p>The Acting-Captain cut me off. &#147;A court-martial? Do you really think
the Admiralty want the embarrassment of a trial? As least Memphre had
the good sense to kill himself, and I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll also do the decent
thing before we reach port. That&#146;s a prediction by the way, not just my
hopeful expectation. Master Sergeant-&#148;</p> <P><p>I took a deep breath. &#147;Computer. Voiceprint identification, Keppler,
Michael. Authentication code, The Trumpets of Jericho.&#148;</p> <P><p>Lutyens laughed, although the gesture made him wince. &#147;Oh, very well,
make a formal statement. Although you must realise that only
those parts which fit our version of events will ever be heard.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Computer, execute protocol Keppler-zero-zero-zero.&#148;</p> <P><p>Lutyens frowned at me. His eyes narrowed. &#147;Sergeant!&#148;</p> <P><p>I heard the <i>schlick</i> as Deluca drew his weapon from its
holster, but he was far too slow. The surveillance points in each corner
also sported laser projectors. They were programmed &#150; <i>in extremis</i>
- to target everyone in the room apart from the senior officer present.
My protocol activated the room defenses and gave me the rank of
acting Commodore &#150; for the brief interval it would take <i>Vulcan</i> to
contact the Admiralty and have my appointment denied.</p> <P><p>The room was filled by a silent blizzard of neon-blue bolts. Although
the lasers were designed to incapacitate rather than kill, Deluca was
hit in the eye and fell to the floor, dead from neurostatic shock.
Lutyens was struck on the tongue, leaving it a slab of burnt and useless
flesh. He jerked and writhed in his chair, hit multiple times. I lifted
Deluca&#146;s fallen weapon and shot the Acting-Captain in the head. </p> <P><p>Biometric analysis detected no remaining potential threat to me and
the defensive system shut down. It had taken only a few seconds. The air
tasted of ozone and burnt meat. No one came to investigate the shot so
perhaps the Marines had been briefed to expect my possible on-the-spot
&#145;suicide&#146; using Deluca&#146;s gun. I remembered to breathe.</p> <P><p>I pushed Lutyens aside and took his place behind the desk. He was
still logged in, giving me full access to all primary systems, but I
didn&#146;t have long before the next routine biometric user check. I
accessed the crew roster, deleting everyone from both the Identify
Friend or Foe and facial recognition systems. Everyone, that is, apart
from myself. Finally I knelt down behind the desk, gun aimed at the
door.</p> <P><p>Klaxons. An automated voice repeating; &#147;<i>Alert, alert. The ship has
been boarded. Secure all stations against intruders&#133;&#148; </i></p> <P><p><i>Vulcan</i> responded like a human body fighting an infection &#150; the
antibodies being pop-up deck guns and a shoal of micro-drones. The ship
had become a deathtrap for the enemy, and that now meant everyone
other than myself.</p> <P><p>I heard muted gunfire and the door opened to reveal a worried-looking
Marine. His face didn&#146;t have time to register surprise before I shot him
in the chest. He coughed, pitched forward onto the deck, and lay still.
The other Marine had his back to me, covering the corridor. He spun
round &#150; only to be cut down from behind by projectile fire. </p> <P><p>Three micro-drones wafted into the room and began their sweep. A
pencil-thin surveillance beam flickered over my face &#150; and moved on. I
sat on the floor, my back to the desk, and waited until they&#146;d checked
out the living quarters and left. Actually I gave myself a good ten
minutes before leaving and making my way along corridors now littered
with bodies. My former ship-mates, colleagues and fellow officers &#150; but
no friends, as Lutyens had pointed out. </p> <P><p>Back on the bridge the ship acknowledged me as the senior officer
left aboard. It sat there, docile - although if I hadn&#146;t been acting XO
<i>Vulcan</i> would have scuttled herself when crew numbers dropped
below critical. Apparently the Admiralty were a great believer in rank,
if not personality.</p> <P><p>After cancelling the alert I ordered the maintenance crawlers to
begin collecting bodies and stacking them in the airlocks. I knew enough
of the navigation systems to find another asteroid waypoint, this one
well off the military thoroughfares and used only by occasional
commercial traffic. <i>Vulcan</i> jumped &#150; and I finally allowed myself
leave to be violently sick.</p> <P><p class=drop>Real space.</p> <P><p>A chunk of rock making its way in a lazy spiral through the
interstellar void. A datum point amidst countless others in the vast
Galactic pseudo-orrery that humanity used to chart a course across the
heavens. I was in the gap between stars, overlooked even by God.</p> <P><p><i>Vulcan</i> rotated slowly, ejecting bodies towards the asteroid as
each airlock came to bear. The minimal gravity field surrounding the
rock would draw the dead into orbit. Better to be part of a
constellation of corpses than drift forever through the loneliness of
space. </p> <P><p>Call me sentimental.</p> <P><p>The ship was in stealth mode, with manual overrides to prevent it
re-establishing connection with NavyNet. All passive sensors indicated
that I was alone, the only living thing for ten parsecs. The thrill of
what I&#146;d achieved made me laugh out loud. </p> <P><p>I directed the main antenna towards an abandoned mining colony in the
Henderson Drift system. Occasionally optimistic scavengers passed
through there on the off-chance of finding something that others had
overlooked. Which is to say the presence of a ship wouldn&#146;t register as
noteworthy, even to Naval Intelligence. I transmitted a micro-burst
carrier wave &#150;and waited.</p> <P><p>And waited.</p> <P><p><i>&#147;Communication established. Audio-only selected.&#148;</i></p> <P><p>A woman&#146;s voice; mature, throaty with an undercurrent of amusement.
&#147;Well?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;This is Keppler. Our plan worked <i>perfectly</i>.&#148;</p> <P><p class=drop>I lay on a sun-lounger, wearing only wraparound
sunglasses and an easy smile. The naturalist retreat on Helios was an
exclusive resort, deep within the core systems. A secondary news feed in
my peripheral vision reported that a fifth corporation had paid the
&#145;Vulcan extortionists&#146; an undisclosed sum to leave them alone, but I was
happy enough with my one-time payment from the original hijacking. </p> <P><p>The Admiralty were still playing hardball, refusing to deal with
terrorists. However they&#146;d been unable to prevent the loss of a further
two frontier planets despite a full mobilization. Military spending
across known space was through the roof, which I suspected was the real
motive behind this whole affair. Those who&#146;d invested in defence
industries prior to the &#145;Jetter Incident&#146; had made a killing. </p> <P><p>A shadow fell across me; a tall blond man wearing baggy beach shorts.
He carried a gun in his pocket and didn&#146;t seem pleased to see me.
Despite my clean getaway and new identity I&#146;d been half-expecting this &#150;
a visit from either my former confederates or Naval black ops. The only
real security was death so I&#146;d shelled out a small fortune for clone
insurance, complete with real-time updates. The prospect of experiencing
my own murder made me shiver with anticipation.</p> <P><p>The man smiled, although not with his eyes. &#147;Really, Michael, lying
out all day in the sun like this?&#148; He drew a Tesla pistol, the glowing
blue coil indicating it was fully charged, &#147;You&#146;re liable to get
burned.&#148;</p> <P><p><i>Uplink terminated&#133;</i></p>
