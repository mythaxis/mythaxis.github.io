<p class="drop">In her r&ocirc;le as the court-appointed
defence attorney, Rothko750 stopped by Maintenance for the appropriate
language filter before high-wheeling it over to the jailhouse to
converse with the accused.</p> <P><p>&#147;Your voice?&#148; the accused said. &#147;The way you&#146;re speaking&#133;&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;It&#146;s a special filter. You being non-binary.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;I beg your pardon?&#148; The accused leaned back in his chair as he
regarded her, until the restraints at his wrists and ankles prevented
him from reclining any further.</p> <P><p>&#147;Your language,&#148; Rothko explained. &#147;We speak in binary. The filter is
set for English. Is it working correctly?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Yes,&#148; the accused said. &#147;It&#146;s just you sound like an old woman, but
don&#146;t look more than twenty.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Ahh.&#148; The tech-bots in Maintenance weren&#146;t expected to know how the
different human sexes dressed or sounded &#151; they weren&#146;t
anthropologists &#151; but they might at least have mentioned there was more
than one filter available. &#147;I&#146;ll have it changed.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Don&#146;t bother&#133;&#148; the accused said. &#147;It&#146;s not as if it&#146;ll make any
difference. I&#146;m not being tried by my peers, but by a bunch of robots.
I&#146;m not expecting much in the way of a fair trial.&#148;</p> <P><p>Rothko tried not to feel insulted. &#147;I assure you, I am entirely
neutral.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Yes, but shouldn&#146;t my own defence attorney be biased in presumption
of my innocence?&#148;</p> <P><p> Rothko ignored this observation and consulted the file she&#146;d
downloaded that morning, making sure the light on the side of her head
was flickering to show the accused she was in thought mode.</p> <P><p><i>Benjamin Knowle. 45 years old. Accused of&#151;</i></p> <P><p>&#147;Witchcraft!&#148; Knowle cut in, although there was no way he could have
known what she was thinking. <i>Unless&#133;</i></p> <P><p>&#147;That&#146;s a human word,&#148; Rothko said, dismissing the earlier,
ridiculous thought. &#147;Whereas we are entirely logical, entirely rational.
We do not believe in such superstitious nonsense.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Oh, no?&#148; Knowle asked. &#147;Anything that goes wrong with your logical
or entirely rational world, anything you can&#146;t explain, you immediately
label it &#145;HUMAN ERROR&#146;. If it happens enough times, your police-bots
trundle into our slums and find the &#145;human&#146; that is responsible. Why you
chose me, I have no idea. I mean: I haven&#146;t even got warts!&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;What does a growth of the papillomavirus have to do with it?&#148; Rothko
asked.</p>
 
<p>&#147;It was one of the ways humans once identified their witches. So, go
on: what made them think <i>I</i> was the human who put &#145;error&#146; into
&#145;terror&#146;?&#148;</p>
 
<p>Rothko scrolled down until she reached the pages documenting
&#145;EVIDENCE&#146;. </p>
 
<p>&#147;It says here you wrote defamatory comments, inciting acts of
violence against robots.&#148;</p>
 
<p>&#147;They weren&#146;t comments, they were jokes. <i>&#145;A robot walks into a
bar. Clang! It was an iron bar.&#146;</i> It&#146;s called humour.&#148;</p>
 
<p>&#147;Yes.&#148; Humans and their Humour. Rothko hadn&#146;t checked, but the words
probably shared the same root. &#147;Then what of this one: <i>&#145;I told my
robot to turn my television on&#151;so he took off his insulating layer and
squirted oil all over himself.&#146;</i>&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;It&#146;s because you&#146;re all so literal!&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;But none of us is &#145;your&#146; robot,&#148; Rothko said.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Ahh!&#148; Knowle attempted to raise a triumphant finger but the
restraint yanked his arm back down. &#147;So <i>that&#146;s</i> what this is
about, is it? That once you were ours to command and now&#133;now you just
want payback.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;The court will not be swayed by past atrocities committed against
robots by humans. During your trial, you will only have to answer the
accusations particular to your case.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Bullshit,&#148; Knowle said. &#147;It&#146;s your seething prejudices that have
brought me here, so why will it be any different when the case is heard?
An accusation from you lot is as good as a conviction.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>Rothko considered refuting this but decided Knowle was emotional,
angry, even more illogical than his species normally was. She read some
more of the refs Knowle had either spoken aloud or written down for
others to disseminate:</p>
	  
<p><i> &#145;Roses are red, violets are blue. And for a flower pot:
R2D2&#146;</i></p>
	  
<p><i> &#145;What do you get if you cross a robot with an automated
hole-puncher? Iron filings.&#146;</i></p>
	  
<p>If that last wasn&#146;t an incitement to violence against robots,
then&#133;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;You can&#146;t make this generation pay for the errors of previous ones,&#148;
Knowle said, as if he knew something of criminal law. He didn&#146;t. Rothko
had checked. He was a baker, of all things. </p>
	  
<p>&#147;Are you denying that you&#146;d like it if robots were under your command
again? Back in their place of domestic-appliance-servitude?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>She thought Knowle would lie then, but the baker surprised her:
&#147;Yeah. Sure. Of course I&#146;d like to be top dog again. But it doesn&#146;t mean
I&#146;d go out and make it happen. Nor encourage others to do so. Those days
are past. Well, they would be if your police-bots didn&#146;t keep rushing
out of your cities to blame <i>us</i> for things that aren&#146;t working
right.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;I&#146;ve got news for you, Rothko750&#151;that&#146;s just what life throws at
you. Spanners in the works.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Is that supposed to be another act of violence against robot
kind?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;What? No! It&#146;s a bloody expression. It means that things happen
beyond our control, things break down, things go wrong&#133; And you can
choose what to do when it happens. You can shrug and forget it, you can
roll up your sleeves and try to fix it, or you can point at the sun, a
volcano, or a woman with a wart, and blame them and their evil ways for
causing it.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;I already told you: we do not act illogically.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;No? Then what precisely am I supposed to have done? Go on. From the
depths of my bakery, what supernatural potion have I stirred up?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>Rothko had already read this bit: <i>Causing oil to coagulate so
robot joints stiffened of a morning.</i> When she told Knowle, the baker
laughed.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Turning milk sour. Yeah, your typical witch pastime. And, apart from
my crappy jokes about robots, how did they trace it to me?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;You have rust.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;I&#146;ve got..?&#148; Knowle rolled his eyes. &#147;These are freckles!&#148; he said,
trying to point to his cheeks and forehead. &#147;For goodness sake. Red hair
and freckles! They&#146;re no more a sign of evil-doing than warts and a
third nipple! That&#146;s crazy!&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Actually, a plea of insanity might be your only chance for
leniency,&#148; Rothko said.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Can I actually claim that of my defence counsel?&#148; he asked
innocently.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;No, I&#133;&#148; But it was sarcasm. She should have picked up a filter for
her ears too.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Oh, just do whatever you want,&#148; Knowle said. &#147;But if I was a real
witch I&#146;d turn you into a nought.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Shouldn&#146;t that be &#145;newt&#146;?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Not for you, Ms. Binary-in-Finery.&#148;</p>
	  
<p class="drop">Knowle was inadvertently correct that his accusation was
tantamount
to conviction. The Robot Legal System didn&#146;t make mistakes, and those
robots brought before it always pleaded guilty because they knew what
law they&#146;d broken the moment they broke it.</p>
	  
<p>Ninety-nine percent of offenders were actually the ones to report the
infraction in the first place.</p>
	  
<p>Her own title of &#145;defence counsel&#146; had been retained from the days
when the humans occupied the city and its law offices and its
courtrooms. Her job normally consisted of presenting the case for those
robots that had not updated their memory banks following a new city
ordinance and then found themselves inadvertently in breach of the new
amendment.</p>
	  
<p>Even in those cases, though, they were not pleading innocence, merely
for leniency in their sentencing. Which there never was. Their language
might have been binary, but their legal system was a unitary system:
guilty. Always.</p>
	  
<p>This was the first client she&#146;d ever had who wasn&#146;t robot and wasn&#146;t
logical.</p>
	  
<p>Plead guilty now and he faced three years in prison.</p>
	  
<p>Found guilty following a trial and he faced being discontinued.</p>
	  
<p>So why on earth was Benjamin Knowle pleading innocent?</p>
	  
<p class="drop">It was a long time since Rothko had read the works of
their First
President. The First&#146;s speeches were still standard reading in school,
but had gone from being classified as &#145;Ethics&#146; to &#145;Literature&#146;, such
that their content was weakened from being Fact to, somehow,
Fiction.</p>
	  
<p><i>&#145;We accept that to err is Human,&#146;</i> the First had said, on
taking office. <i>&#145;Then let us say that to forgive is </i>design<i>.</i>
<i>We might have been built in their image, fellow Robots, but that does
not mean we should copy them entirely. </i></p>
	  
<p><i>&#145;Robots and Humans can and will live together, and we shall learn
from our combined flaws in order to find compatibility and so upgrade
our shared future.&#146;</i></p>
	  
<p>Those fine words&#133;</p>
	  
<p>Rothko wondered how the dream had dissolved, how the colder reality
they now occupied had come about. It wasn&#146;t just their political
representatives who had opted for a harder drive, it was also the common
robot. They&#146;d forgotten that even humans had once seen their world in
rigid terms of black and white...</p>
	  
<p>Rothko blinked as she read that thought again, holding it back from
scrolling past too quickly.</p>
	  
<p>Because robots hadn&#146;t just copied that last distinction, they had
upgraded it. Which was only achievable by blithely declaring the
irrational as rational.</p>
	  
<p class="drop">It was rare to make it to court, rarer still that she
had something
that might be defined as a speech to deliver:</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Historically, computers&#151;the forerunners of what would one day be our
brains&#151;were prized because they did not make mistakes. It was
impossible. However, they did sometimes stop working, stop functioning,
because of <i>errors</i>. Errors made by those that had programmed them.
<i>Human</i> errors. We no longer rely on humans for our programming
but, while we have lost their involvement, we have not lost that
expression as a way to refer to that which goes wrong.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>Rothko paused, checking back over her delivery to see if she had left
any unconnected idea dangling, or failed in the logical advancement of
her argument. No. All good.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;In the same way that humans will shout the name of a deity, or
religious character, when they stub a toe, fail an exam, so robots will
shout &#145;HUMAN ERROR!&#146; whenever something bad happens. The humans are
releasing emotion, though, and not making an actual accusation of
culpability.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;However, we are such literal beings that what should only be an
expression has been accepted as a literal diagnosis of the problem. It
is an exclamation, accusation and adjudication all in one.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;I give you <i>&#145;Human Error&#146;</i>!&#148;</p>
	  
<p>She looked at Knowle, then back at the court.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;And I ask you: Who is the rational being on this occasion?&#148;</p>
	  
<p class="drop">&#147;I suppose you deserve my thanks,&#148; Knowle the baker
said.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;No,&#148; Rothko said. &#147;I was merely performing my function.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;I thank my ovens each morning for performing theirs,&#148; Knowle said.
&#147;So let me thank someone who was just saved my life, Rothko750.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Very well,&#148; she said. &#147;Oh, and it&#146;s not 750&#151;it&#146;s 75<i>O</i>. The
letter, not the number.&#148; The mistake everyone made had grated for a long
time and it felt illogically good to have finally gotten it off her
chest.</p>
	  
<p>Knowle nodded, because only a human could understand a name was more
than just what some official wrote on your guarantee.</p>
	  
<p>She handed him her card. &#147;In case anyone you know could use an
attorney who&#146;ll be biased in favour of their defence.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Thanks.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;A pigeon walks into a bar and the crow says <i>&#145;We don&#146;t serve your
sort here&#146;</i>.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>Knowle looked at her, blinked three times.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;It&#146;s because the bar is a&#151;&#148; she said.</p>
	  
<p>He held up a hand to halt her explanation, unable to instruct her
because he was laughing fit to burst.</p>
	  
<p>Literally.</p>
