            <p>While casting about for a subject for this issue&rsquo;s editorial, a friend proposed the topic <em>&ldquo;Why I think writing an editorial for my incredible magazine whose quality fiction speaks for itself is more important than writing my own incredible fiction&rdquo;</em>. They went on to observe that, <em>seriously, editorials are boring and pointless</em>, asserting that <em>nobody reads them</em> (dissenters to this claim being a statistical anomoly, likely akin to the one suggesting that there is intelligent life in the universe), before wrapping up their position with a concrete suggestion for the editorial&rsquo;s full content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you doing reading this bit? Go on, shoo! Go read the stories! Go on, get out of here! Shoo!
Signed, the Editor</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is, once you start down the write-an-editorial path, it&rsquo;s hard to get off it again. I mean, the tab&rsquo;s right there in our masthead banner options thingie, it&rsquo;d be silly to waste it. Plus I need a place to thank our cover artists for their generosity, can&rsquo;t skip that (on which subject see below why not). There&rsquo;s not a lot we can do without completely overhauling the magazine&rsquo;s whole design really, is ther—</p>
<p>…oh. <em>Hmm.</em> Now there&rsquo;s a thought.</p>
<p>Because it has occurred to me, as I&rsquo;ve worked on this year&rsquo;s issues, that <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> and myself approach a little milestone. Although Gil Williamson comfortably remains our longest-serving editor, founding the magazine in 2008 and helming it for exactly a decade, it was always published on a when-the-urge-took-him schedule. When he handed me the reins (an act that has genuinely changed my life!) I decided to aim for regularity instead. As a result, as of today, I have overseen more issues than Gil did. By one. Come the end of 2025, by two.</p>
<p>These two eras of <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> history have basically presented different faces to the world (as you can see for yourself if you check out the <strong>Back Issues</strong> and <strong>The Original Archive</strong> on our <a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/archive.html">Archive page</a>). Therefore, why not launch our first issue of 2026 with another new look? Why not commission a new logo? Why not a whole host of them?</p>
<p>I think I shall!</p>
<p>Anyway, what are you doing reading this bit? Go on, shoo! Go read the stories!</p>
<p>Go on, get out of here!</p>
<p>Shoo!</p>

						<em><strong>Andrew</strong> is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing</em> Mythaxis <em>he has been published in a small handful of quality zines, and co-authored a serialised alternate history adventure novel. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesn’t <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewleonhudson">do things online</a> often enough to count.</em></p>
					<p></p>
					<p><strong>ISSUE 43</strong> – <em><strong>Thanks and Salutations.</strong></em> For the third time, much gratitude to <a href="https://linktr.ee/kvacm">Michal Kváč</a>, who bestows some retro style on us with his image &lsquo;Synthwave&rsquo;. A freelance environment concept artist and illustrator from Czech Republic, you can click the link above to see his work and make contact, or check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kvacm">Youtube channel</a> for time-lapse videos of his process. Thanks yet again, Michal!</p>
