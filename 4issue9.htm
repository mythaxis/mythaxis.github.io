<div><i>A Desire Named Streetcar?</i>
<p class=drop>I&#146;m waiting at the bus stop again, though I
know I&#146;m not going anywhere. <br> <P>It&#146;s past midnight, and I am standing
outside in Thornhill. The pale
morning sky is just a memory as the dark blue night and its streetlamps
turn the crinkled autumn leaves and road into a light incandescent
purple. I feel the dark brown bulk of Thornhill Public School looming
over my head like ancient history, even as I stand beside the glass
walls of the bus shelter. It reminds me of where I came from &#133; and
where, if I wasn&#146;t careful, I could easily find myself coming back to. <P>And I hadn&#146;t been careful. <P>So I&#146;m standing here, at the York Region Transit stop, playing a very
long-standing game with myself. It is the game of how I recognize my old
elementary school from Grades 1-3 behind me. It is the game of looking
at the white and green painted Farmer&#146;s Market in the plaza across the
street from me, and the purple Octagon restaurant off to the side. It is
knowing the rolling hills of Gallanough Park behind my old school, and
the location of Thornhill Secondary School -- of my high school -- just
a few blocks past the plaza across the street as you walk past the old
Masonic Temple on the left-hand side. <P>The object of this game is simple. I walk past the craft stores, and
apartments, and streets, and my old schools and hidden parks until I get
to the secluded St. Volodymyr&#146;s Ukrainian Catholic Church; the space
dividing the cemeteries of St. Luke&#146;s Catholic Church from the old
Thornhill Community&#146;s; the nearby houses with their windows of
candlelight; to Markham and the purportedly haunted
white-planked Thornhill Village Library all the way back to this bus
stop where I
realize -- again -- that I&#146;d barely even miss this place if
I went on a bus right now, at this moment, and never returned. <P>That is the game I&#146;m playing right now. <P>And then I remember that it is past midnight and there is no bus
running this late, and that even if there were, it would be coming
from
Richmond Hill and moving past this stop to the glittering lights of the
real city of Toronto -- where it'd just stop at the Finch Station
terminal and I&#146;d have to pay yet another fare to use the separate subway
system. In other words, it
leads to no uncharted places, nor any horizons to disappear to. <P>There&#146;s no great mystery to vanish into. <P>So I walk away from the place where I wait for the bus that will never
come &#133; from the place that I now know all too well. I stride forward and
cross the street to the sidewalk past the empty gas station, and I walk
across again to the other side of the darkened street. <P>I keep walking. Every time I walk here, in this region, I feel as though
I am enacting an age-old rote of walking - of mapping, and tracing, and
connecting the rural suburban streets and roads together with the
movement of my legs. I try to convince myself that it is all one great
rite of correspondence, place, space and time - that somewhere, somehow,
this all has meaning for me &#133; that it will accomplish something &#133;
something whose understanding is just inches away from my subconscious
mind. <P>I try, unsuccessfully, to figure out what this is and only the old
familiar hollowness remains. Instead, I spend most of my time trying not
to think about the shimmering lights of the city that I almost made it
to; the place I turned my back on, and all the things I learned there.
It too had been a lonely place - though its ghosts &#133; its mistakes, are
far
more fresh than the old memories here that live in every piece of cement
and blade of grass. <P>No. The closest I&#146;d ever gotten to the city, to the place I&#146;d never
thought to escape to, to physically leaving this place was moving to
York University, and a piece of paper. <P>For all the two years that lasted. <P>Now, as I walk down the sloping sidewalk and cross another street, I
know that there was never an escape. Toronto&#146;s vicarious promises were
merely a brief respite from Thornhill&#146;s empty certainties. <P>No matter what happened, after everything I did,
and where I came from I
always knew that I was going to be back here. <P><div class=pullquote>They glitter like trails of twilight, or streaks of
pale coloured chalk</div>I walk past the Starbucks plaza now; past more
craft stores, and the
Village Library with its ethereal night-dweller and her nocturnal
reading habits. That is one of the few thoughts that makes me smile now
-
to imagine that this ghost is quietly reading all the oldest and latest
books in the safety and warmth of the place she&#146;s known for almost her
entire existence. It is a thought that makes me smile even as, for some
reason, it makes me sad. <P>I continue walking as the pavement becomes a railing opening up to a
grove of trees below on my right side. For a few brief moments, as short
as those two years were, I shone more brightly than I did my entire
short life. Just to have to return here. Just to return to slumber &#133; and
restless sleepwalking. <P>I come to a stop in front of a white picket fence and a wide sloping
park. Thornhill is not a place of the present. It is a place of ghosts,
dogs, young families, old men, used books, and merely the memories of
present life. <P>And if you don&#146;t leave it, it becomes the place you haunt while you are still alive. <P>Goosebumps flicker across my back. For the first time, I actually
realize that the moon is out. I look around me. Then I look behind me.
I&#146;m standing in front of what looks like an old cottage. This is
Cricklewood Park - a long-established Women&#146;s Golf
 course I&#146;ve passed many times
with my Dad as we&#146;ve driven to the movie theatre in Richmond Hill.
During the day, the little cottage or hut is a faded
turquoise with a painted thatched roof and a brown sign in
yellow-lettering that reads: <P>Stop 17. <P><p class=drop>I&#146;ve never exactly known what it was. I always assumed
that it was the
site of another golf course, or a storage shed. In fact, I&#146;ve never
really thought much of it. But for some reason, tonight, I feel
compelled to stand right in front of it. <P>I&#146;m standing off on the side of the road in front of Cricklewood Park. I
feel like I&#146;m waiting for something - waiting in the same way I wait in
front of Thornhill Public School for a non-existent bus to take me
nowhere. I feel cold. <P>Perhaps it&#146;s just the autumn condensation in the air, but I swear I can
see something on the road in front of me. They glitter like trails of
twilight, or streaks of pale coloured chalk under a layer of Black
Magic. I squint my eyes. If I didn&#146;t know any better, I would say they
are ... streetcar tracks. It&#146;s an odd thought. The only streetcars I
know about are the ones I would always take in the city, in Toronto -
sleek, barely clanking things that ran sporadically at all hours of the
night. <P><div class=pullquote>Back in Thornhill Secondary School, my Drama
teacher always said I was &#147;otherworldly&#148;</div>Thornhill doesn&#146;t have a
streetcar line. It hasn&#146;t had one in a long
time. Because &#133; I remember now. Almost every time we drive to Silver
City, in Richmond Hill, my Dad always tells me my grandparents told him
that a streetcar once rode here. It was a railway track that extended
from Toronto and Yonge Street all the way into Richmond Hill and beyond
to Lake Simcoe. Occasionally, I wondered where the line used to stop in
Thornhill. If it did. <P>But that had been ages ago. The rails had long since disappeared. First
the car became limited to travel only from Toronto to Richmond Hill
until -- after two distant World Wars -- in 1948, it was either covered
over with concrete, or dismantled altogether. It is strange to think
about, as I look at the lines of dew on the neon pastel of the road,
that underneath your feet are the broken ley-lines of previous
connections &#133; of psycho-geography now going nowhere. <P>I hear the sound of clanking. <P>Slowly, to the far right of me, I see a shape coming down the slope of
the road. I don&#146;t move. I don&#146;t even make a sound. At first, as I see
its headlights in the distance I think it&#146;s a car or a truck. Then it
comes closer. <P>It is almost coming towards me now. My sense of waiting becomes a
strange feeling of anticipation. As the shape comes closer, I see that
it&#146;s a round and clunky vehicle. In the light of the full moon and the
few lampposts illuminating the street, it seems to look like a car of a
very worn down Go-Train. But then, as the shadows play over it I can
swear that it looks just like a TTC streetcar. <P>This isn&#146;t possible, of course. For one thing, the TTC doesn&#146;t run into
York Region. And for another, in that brief glimpse, this streetcar
looks older -- again, bulkier with its red and white paint as faded as
the balls on my grandmother&#146;s pool table. It is like an antique toy of
an old fire-engine. <P>Then finally, the car or train, or streetcar begins to hiss out
decompressed steam, and comes to a halt right in front of me. It now
definitely looks like a TTC car. I can even make out its serial number:
416. The side door opens and I see a man sitting in the driver&#146;s seat. I
can&#146;t make out his face, but in the dim light of the car&#146;s interior I
know he&#146;s not wearing the maroon jacket of today&#146;s TTC drivers. Instead,
it looks like he&#146;s wearing a grey uniform &#133; or perhaps a brown shirt
with slacks of the same colour. <P>My Dad once told me he remembered that my grandparents always said the
people of the city looked forward to riding the old radial car with
great joy. And suddenly, it all makes sense. All those years of walking,
and nostalgia, and remembering, and waiting finally make sense. <P>The driver&#146;s waiting for me. I spare the road around me one last glance.
Aside from my immediate family, no one else will really miss me now. In
fact, I suspect that once I step into this car, I will become part of a
different pattern altogether; a path that very few travel &#133; a road that
has opened itself up to me. <P>All my glories, and disappointments, all my unfulfilled
dreams and
&#147;what-nows,&#148; all my heaviness and exhaustion will melt away into
mystery. And I will get to fade away with a legend. I think of Edgar
Allan Poe and Randolph Carter&#146;s &#147;Silver Key&#148; as a powerful chill ripples
through my flesh &#133; and I genuinely smile. I now know what I have been
waiting for. Back in Thornhill Secondary School, my Drama teacher always
said I was &#147;otherworldly&#148;. I wonder if he&#146;ll say the same thing now
whenever someone looks at the Writer&#146;s Plaque left behind in the front
hall&#146;s display case after I am long gone. <P>Then, with this last delicious, satisfying thought in mind I get on the
streetcar and travel &#133; back to the city, to other places, other spaces &#133;
to nowhere, and to everything. <P><P><small>Copyright &copy; Matthew Kirshenblatt 2011 All Rights
