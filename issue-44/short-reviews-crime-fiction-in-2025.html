oth of our previous annual crime review roundups have included stories in <em><a href="https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/">TOUGH</a></em> from Redneck Press, but this may be the last time that happens as, communicated via a cut-to-the-chase post at the start of September thanking past contributors, the zine is now on indefinite hiatus, bringing to an end eight years of operations. If I&rsquo;m being honest, as a reader I found its offerings a very mixed bag, though there were some good tales in there for sure. To which point, three stood out for me over its final nine months.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/05/keeper-fiction-by-scott-blackburn.html">Keeper</a></strong> by Scott Blackburn slips us into lives sunk to the bottom but (mostly) determined to pull themselves up to see better days, and shines a light on the good, and bad, choices such determination may inspire in moments of looming crisis. The musically motivated <strong><a href="https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/04/shriek-of-week-fiction-nick-mamatas.html">Shriek of the Week</a></strong> by Nick Mamatas feels increasingly irreal, drifting almost dreamily alongside a disfigured dropout with a head full of school-shooting buckshot that picks up heavy metal airplay from local radio stations, tormented by conspiracies of corrupt COVID cops in a locked-down NYC. But my favourite was probably Vinnie Hansen&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/03/justice-served-fiction-by-vinnie-hansen.html">Justice Served</a></strong>, a San Diego acid-trip to SeaWorld that&rsquo;s actually (or rather <em>also</em>) a private eye yarn in a fairly classic vein: a brutal mystery to be explored and explained, by a social outsider with a nose for information and a smoking hot blonde for a client. Good fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a shame when a publication closes its doors, but the short genre fic business is very much this fallen comrade&rsquo;s namesake: <em>tough</em>.</p>

n between the gone for good and a new kid on the block, the evergreen <em><a href="https://shotgunhoney.com/">Shotgun Honey</a></em> has been chambering rounds and pulling the trigger on the crazy regular for almost fifteen years. Call it &ldquo;sawn-off&rdquo; fiction rather than &ldquo;flash&rdquo;, three recent releases caught my eye, one of them very much off the beaten path for crime.</p>
<p>The other two first. <strong><a href="https://shotgunhoney.com/fiction/death-valley-by-jacob-sloane/">Death Valley</a></strong> by Jacob Sloane does what super-short fiction is best at: setting things up quick then getting out quick too. In this case, a classic aftermath scene gets a bittersweet twist, heavier on the bitter than the sweet. By comparison, with only a slightly longer word count <strong><a href="https://shotgunhoney.com/fiction/in-a-cage-with-the-sharks/">In a Cage with the Sharks</a></strong> by Hubble Stark somehow manages to seem to take its time, recounting a history, inhabiting its characters, before twisting fate in a way that, yes, you do see coming, but completely don&rsquo;t mind being right about.</p>
<p>And now for that third. When I see the title <strong><a href="https://shotgunhoney.com/fiction/among-the-neanderthals-by-richie-narvaez/">Among the Neanderthals</a></strong> in a zine like this, my mind goes to street thugs, prison yards, that sort of setting – even when author Richie Narvaez started on about caves and tribes and brow ridges and flint-lit fires I thought it must be metaphor. But no: this yarn takes place in the pre-history of our species, and the crime in question could be anything from kidnap to genocide.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the moral? <em>Don&rsquo;t bring a rock to an arrow fight</em>, maybe…</p>
<p><img src="images/Orbit.svg" alt="Orbit-sml &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><glyph >M</glyph>

y final recommendation is more like a case of <em>first amongst equals</em>, as out of the mere five stories which have to date appeared in <em><a href="https://coldcallermag.substack.com/">Cold Caller</a></em>, a new crime zine platformed on Substack, four struck me as more or less equally interesting reads. I won&rsquo;t link them all, there&rsquo;s few enough to sift through, and while I could as easily have gone for <strong>Strangers</strong>, <strong>Used to Be Some Kind of Badass</strong>, or <strong>When Things Get a Little Western</strong>, the one I&rsquo;ll mention in particular is Colleen Quinn&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://coldcallermag.substack.com/p/calamity-creek">Calamity Creek</a></strong>.</p>
<p>What begins as reminiscences about that type of faintly notorious local kid you used to distantly know growing up segues into a glimpse of a community&rsquo;s dirty little open secret, evoking a character-filled corner of small town USA which crams remarkable breadth and depth into it&rsquo;s tight, brief runtime. I really enjoyed the writing in <strong>Calamity Creek</strong>, the personalities and situations past and present all rang true, and I could happily have kept reading beyond where it came to a halt. On the other hand, they do say <em>Always leave them wanting more</em>.</p>
<p>The four stories I named are all very different and I enjoyed them in different ways, but I&rsquo;ll make an observation verging on critique: in each case, I felt that the story&rsquo;s end was not its strongest feature. The fifth piece, <em>The Man Who Hated Dogs</em>, which was certainly not bad, did strike me as a somewhat more &ldquo;complete&rdquo; narrative, though for me it also signposted itself way too clearly, right from that title. Nevertheless, on the strength of what they have published so far I&rsquo;ll certainly keep an eye on <em>Cold Caller</em> in the future.</p>
