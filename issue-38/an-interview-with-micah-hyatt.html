            <p><strong>Andrew Leon Hudson:</strong> Hi Micah! We at <em>Mythaxis</em> know you as a writer of tight, emotive flash fiction and distinctive sf poetry, but tell us a little more about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Micah Hyatt:</strong> I live in Corpus Christi, Texas, and I have four kids, all in Scouts. My wife works as a program director with the Boy Scouts, and we have six dogs: one shih-tzu, one shiuaua, two chihuahuas, one chorkie, and one white wolf. The wolf was a rescue.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> How do you rescue a wolf?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> About three years ago, a police car t-boned us and totaled our vehicle in the dead of winter and this very fluffy puppy came out to inspect the noise. I was still rattled from the wreck, but I picked her up and searched for an owner or a mother or other pups for about an hour. There was snow on the ground and I was worried she&rsquo;d freeze. Eventually a police van took my family home, since the wreck was their fault, pup included. Later, when she got bigger, I was wondering what kind of dog she was, so I did a reverse image search. We were very surprised to find that she was a native Texan white wolf. She&rsquo;s very smart and knows all kinds of tricks, but only obeys me. Her name is Calamity Jane.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> A life with little going on then. How have you kept busy?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> I&rsquo;m a former train conductor and Iraq war veteran. After the war, I was diagnosed with several neurological issues. If you look at my cluster of symptoms, it&rsquo;s basically Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. However, I&rsquo;m too young for that, so I&rsquo;ve been categorized as having various functional neurological disorders and traumatic brain injury. I worked my job at the railroad as long as I could safely, but eventually I had to stop driving and quit working, and then went through vocational rehabilitation training with the Veterans Association.</p>
<p>Recreationally, I swim as much as possible. I like watching foreign movies. <em>RRR</em> is my most recent favorite, followed by <em>The New King of Comedy</em> by Stephen Chow. I also enjoy playing video games. <em>Sekiro</em> is the best game ever made. This is not up for discussion.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> You must mean <em>Knytt Underground</em>. Anyway, as well as contributing fiction here you&rsquo;ve participated in our brief flirtation with generative art, and now you&rsquo;re providing us with audio! What led you to experiment with these different formats?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> I received a master&rsquo;s in English in the Writing Popular Fiction program at Seton Hill University in Pennsylvania. My thesis was a thousand-page military fantasy whalepunk novel. It was pretty good for a thesis novel, not good enough that I&rsquo;d want to send it out. I&rsquo;ve been working on another draft on and off since graduation. While I was at university there was a reading contest every semester, and I took first place every time. People said I had a nice voice. However, as my neurological disorders began to worsen I developed issues speaking, so I decided to start recording stories as a form of therapy to train myself how to speak properly again.</p>
<p>My first attempt was a new edition of the first <em>Doctor Doolittle</em> book. It has all kinds of crazy voices, talking ducks and pigs. But, as much as I loved it, the book is very dated with many racist scenes and jokes. These were taken out in a version edited in the 70s, but that version is terrible, it stripped all the humor too. Since the original is out of copyright, I re-edited it, wrote two new chapters, and recorded the whole thing. It was fun, but I think it took me about 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> Tell us about your studio setup.</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> When I moved to Corpus Christi, I knew that I wanted to continue recording. My previous setup wasn&rsquo;t great, and I wanted to improve recording quality. My upstairs hallway at the new house has a walk-in closet. It&rsquo;s big for a closet, but too small to be a bedroom. I think it&rsquo;s 6&rsquo;x8'.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> My love of <em>Spinal Tapp</em> informs me that&rsquo;s pretty damn small. Oh, right: <em>feet</em>. So that&rsquo;s about&hellip; 180cm by 250cm?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> Sure, why not. I ordered foam panels from Amazon and covered the walls with them. I have a noise-canceling curtain that I slide behind me after I shut the door, and something called a draft blocker for the underside of the door. I drilled a hole in the wall between the closet and my daughter&rsquo;s room, and fed all the cables into there. The only electronics I have in the room are silent running – a single widescreen monitor so that I can have the story on one side and the recording software on the other at the same time.</p>
<p>Reduction of unnecessary heat and sound sources are probably the most important thing, followed by comfort. One thing I quickly realized was that there was no air-conditioning or ventilation in the room at all. For the first year this meant, unless I wanted to be a sweat-drenched monster, I could only record in the winter or the spring. This year I finally had a ventilation duct put in.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> That&rsquo;s the DIY, now dazzle us with the tech.</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> For really good quality sound you don&rsquo;t want one of those USB-to-PC microphones. I use a Focusrite Scarlit 2i2 pre-amp, which is the interface between my microphone and my computer and boosts the mic&rsquo;s signal. My mic is an Audio-technica 5040, which is serious overkill. It&rsquo;s much higher quality anyone getting into audio should buy, there are many other microphones that can deliver nearly equivalent performance for 1/8th the price. But I really wanted it.</p>
<p>As for software, initially I used Garageband. It was not ideal. I tried Pro tools, the professional version, but it isn&rsquo;t really made for audiobook narration. I originally used a Mac laptop, but it would heat up so much that the fans in the room sounded like a 747 was coming in for a landing, so I switched to PC and Adobe Audition.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> What is your process for audio production?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> If anyone wants to get into reading, I think you should seek out other readers you like to listen to and see what their process is. Jeff Hays – an amazing reader who reads the <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> series by Matt Dinniman – has a YouTube channel called <em>Soundbooth Theater Live</em>. I&rsquo;ve learned more from a few of his videos than months of suffering on my own.</p>
<p>Firstly, I just read the story. I note down all the characters with speaking roles and try to get a sense of who they are. Sometimes, especially in short fiction, there&rsquo;s not a lot to go on. Next, I get my booth set up. New file. Test recording. Make sure all the dogs and children in my house know that it&rsquo;s time to be quiet for a while. Then I read the story aloud. I use a multitrack layout in Audition so that I can put individual characters on their own tracks. This is important for consistency, and so I can easily do re-takes on their lines after the first read. So I&rsquo;ll read through, keeping the narration on a single track, and separate out the character voices.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> The variety of voice was one of the first things that stood out in your read of <em>Nightshade Memory</em>, the robotic effect was really striking.</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> My own accent is middle to upper class, middle American, pretty close to what you&rsquo;d expect from a white male reporter on the local news channel in a place like Kansas City or New York. For narration, I use something close to my natural speaking voice, but a little more chesty. This is important, because I don&rsquo;t trigger the neurological stutter if I speak in a false voice or an accent, or if I sing. I try to be clear and add meaningful inflection and emphasis on words in a way that I wouldn&rsquo;t normally do when just speaking conversationally.</p>
<p>Sentences have a sort of shape with peaks and valleys, and it varies from culture to culture and accent to accent. For character voices, there&rsquo;s a bunch of little things you can do – speaking from the front of your mouth, the back, the throat, volume control, raspiness, syllable harshness, etc. I&rsquo;m still a newbie. I&rsquo;m learning. Female voices, especially when there are multiple characters that need differentiation, are difficult.</p>
<p>After the recording is done, post-production involves taking out breaths and background noise. There are automated tools for this, but they have drawbacks. Room noise is easy, as it&rsquo;s minimal for me and just a slight hum on a consistent frequency, the hum of the air conditioning and electrical cables. Breathing, though, and mouth smacks and clicks, are a little more difficult. You can run a filter on them, but I&rsquo;ve found that filter will often degrade the quality of the actual speaking a little, so I tend to manually subtract the breaths and clicks as I Iisten back to the story the first time.</p>
<p>I have a series of enhancements I apply over the audio with software. I&rsquo;ve manually tuned it to my voice to boost the meaningful frequencies. It also changes equalization levels and prevents audio from getting too loud. For characters that I want to add special effects to, like robots, I record the lines and then use filters and such to modify the pitch, the reverb, the distortion. All old-school, 00&rsquo;s tech. No AI.</p>
<p><strong>ALH:</strong> So, what projects do you have your eye on for the future?</p>
<p><strong>Micah:</strong> I&rsquo;m still working on the aforementioned military fantasy whalepunk novel. It&rsquo;s called <em>Lightswallower</em>. It got too big, and I had to take about a year to restructure and re-outline it. I&rsquo;ve been writing the first book, tentatively called <em>The Penitent Bone</em>. It&rsquo;s about Galan, an exiled scrimshander priest, who is summoned back to the temple at the Leviathan&rsquo;s Throat. The high priest, Galan&rsquo;s mentor, has died under mysterious circumstances. In a last will and testament carved in whalebone, Galan is absolved of heresy and appointed as the new high priest. Meanwhile, the city comes under siege by a steamwork army whose goal seems to be not as simple as conquest – they want to destroy the secret knowledge hidden in the Leviathan&rsquo;s Throat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also gotten into writing lyrics and poetry, mainly anti-war and anti-military industrial complex in theme. I use AI to turn it into music. This is more of a therapy thing for me. Long writing sessions can be difficult when I have migraines or other issues, but I still want to be creative, and I love music. I can write an intro or a verse and then workshop it with the AI and hear the results right away. I love being able to play &ldquo;producer&rdquo; with a full band and singers at my fingertips. I go by <em><a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/leidenfrostdiver/the-wmds">Leidenfrost Diver</a></em> and you can find tracks on Spotify and YouTube. It&rsquo;s extremely pleasant and entertaining, and I dearly hope the AI scene gets the ethics issues solved, because I love the process and the experimentation of it.</p>

<p>Many thanks again to Micah for taking the time to chat. If you haven&rsquo;t already, check out his reading of <em><a href="https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-38/interlocking-grains-of-light.html">Interlocking Grains of Light</a></em> by LM Zaerr (which, incidentally, features original harp music performed by the author&rsquo;s sister!), and recordings of the other stories of the issue will be released over the coming weeks.</p>
