<div><i>CAUTION: Contact with aliens may damage your health.</i>
<p class=drop>The door swings closed behind Lei Bliley, the latch falling into place
with a click; she turns the key in the lock, listens to the home
security systems come online. Then she stands for a moment, practicing
breathing, something that at this moment remains more of a challenge
than she is particularly happy about. She has been out walking,
exploring the city, looking at the world anew in light of her recent
travels. General Oscar Morse had wanted to keep her under lock and key
deep in the basement of the facility at all times. But the
psychiatrist, Dr Angelique Charles, had argued, insisting that Lei was
scarred, that it was a miracle she had survived, or at least had
survived as intact as she had, and that to cage her would be the final
straw. Dr Charles had insisted that under those conditions Lei would break. <P><p class=drop>None of the others had survived - Hounjet, Panocha and Iteif were all
dead, fragments of bodies returned through the gate; if they wanted
to get anything out of Lei then they would need to take infinite care
of her body and mind. Lei tended to feel that she would have preferred
that they hadn't had that conversation in front of her, even if she
was thankful for the space that it granted her.  <P><div class=lpullquote>Something out
there is tracking her, something out there knows where she is, at least.</div>The trip through the Gateway changed everything; anything she can tell them
is important,
Lei understands that, but her memories are fragmented, and
disturbing. Nevertheless, Lei doesn't want to be treated
like a broken child, even if that is how she feels sometimes, though
very little of that is what you would call her fault. The space and
patience are
essential to her wellbeing, that is clear to her every time she tries to move, let alone go
out. <P>It's not as
if she isn't still being
monitored 24 hours a day - the chip they injected under the skin of her
forearm, the shadows that follow her through the streets, shadows housed next door
so they are only minutes away at any time. She certainly appreciates Dr.
Charles' efforts on her behalf, for all the compromises and balances
that have resulted. The fact that her memories of what happened are
fractured, are far from complete, is something which enrages General
Morse. She can tell, even if he does his best to
keep his temper under control. Those memories which do linger of what
happened are far from pleasant. Her dreams are filled with flashes of
the first contact, of her attempts to communicate, of the screams of her
colleagues. What uncertain horror had made such professional veterans
of space and Exploratory Division missions so hysterical, so distressed? <P>Lei was a language specialist, finishing her doctorate at Tokyo
University, when she was recruited by a branch of military intelligence
and research. The Space Orbital and Extra Dimensional Exploratory
Directorate was a department she had never heard of before, but then
it wasn't exactly an area that she had had previous dealings with. She
was recruited, sworn to secrecy and then they had told her the
absolute bare minimum. She had hesitated; the surgery that was
proposed was extensive, and not something they had mentioned on first
approach, waiting till they had her tied up with contracts and
conspiracies. They offered more money than she could ever dream of,
and then there was the prestige of being an expert in a new language,
one of the few people on the planet to be able to speak an alien
tongue. There had been others before her, who had failed to fulfil the
mission requirements, though she had never been told in
what way they had failed to live up to those requirements. <P>So she had signed up, and started to learn the language through
intensive sessions, from documents, from the transcripts of dreams. It
had seemed absurd to her, the very idea that the alien language had
been derived from dreams! Never had she thought to ask, where do these
dreams come from, who are these people afflicted by dreams of alien
worlds, and what is it like to experience these things? She took it
for granted, the transcripts which she was provided with, the notes
supplied without context.  <P>Now she has become one of those who dream nightly
of horrors; part of this is clearly the memories she has buried from her
visit, part of it is that her brain has been opened, and something out
there is transmitting directly into her mind every night. Something out
there is tracking her, something out there knows where she is, at least.
That is how she feels, the impression she has, lying there alone at
night, drenched in sweat, waiting to see if tonight is the night he
comes for her. <P>But she had done her job, went
through the motions, asked no questions, knowing she would get no
answers, and gradually over time she had cracked the language. The
syntax had been torturous to learn, word structures beyond anything
she had previously encountered, a language that was truly alien, but
as time passed she could actually make some sense of the patterns. <P>"Bath," she calls, listening for the initial, heavier splash, lessening
as the water starts to collect. They have housed her in an apartment
with all the latest facilities, in of one of the city's towers - a
government-owned office building with accommodation located securely at
the top - with a breathtaking view if she were to stand at the window
and look out. Certainly it has everything she could ask for, and more.
She has taken steps to reduce the input from the building's AI - she has
no desire for machine communications. The irritating voice constructed
from a bank of recorded words, with its faux concern for her health has
had to be switched off, feeling too invasive. With her unquiet thoughts
she craves silence, she craves peace. She tugs at the first straps,
taking her time as they come free, buckle by buckle. She has to handle
everything with care, the slightest hurry and she would bruise, the
slightest scrape and she would bleed. They did things to her body before
they travelled, engineered her for a different gravity, tweaked systems
to breathe different atmospheres. They had told her that this was the
first planet they had discovered with this new technology. The planet
was called Slu gishgo Dhom; she had told them that, derived from the
words she had studied, Lei having gone further with the language than
those who had gone before her.   <P>While they boasted about the discovery,
they never revealed how they had discovered
the gateway, the world on the other side - how many failed explorations
had there been? How many failed trips, dead ends, and false leads had
there been? What kind of probe systems were they using in order to
collect the kind of data that was at the root of the work they did to
her? Part of her had wondered how reliable was this data? That was, like
everything else, a secret. So she never said anything out loud,
surrounded as she was by people who seemed very convinced of the
knowledge they had, and the power that not sharing gave them. Though now
Lei had her suspicions that certain things had an inevitability of their
own - perhaps there had been no other explorations, perhaps before the
dreams of that planet leaked into human heads there had been nothing?
Over-confident bastards, Lei cursed. How many of them would suffer the
way that she did now? How many them would be tormented and devoured by
the chilling sight of the alien? Each night she dreamt the answer to
those questions &#150; many would suffer. <P>She hangs the torso harness in its charger by the door. Flexes too-long 
fingers, to work out the feeling of stiffening. Still not used to
the way her skin was discoloured by alien skies, the burnt out red sun
tinted her an ash grey, something else to add to the list of things
they wanted to sample and prod - collecting flakes of skin and hair
samples, daily syringes of blood. She runs one hand across the other,
runs a hand to her elbow, flexes again, and another stroke. Constantly
convinced she can brush the changes away, or at least feel the
difference beneath her finger tips. She can't, it feels like flesh,
just flesh. She winces, closes her eyes, takes slow abrasive breaths.
The latest spike of pain flashes through her, she rubs her temples.
Her skull feels too close to the surface, somehow warped and out of
shape. It seems as though veins pulse there, each circuit a physical pain,
so that Lei suspects her head will implode at any moment. <P>She had been changed too much, what has she now become? Human, or
alien, or some absurdist hybrid, some missing link found between the
two? Is it any wonder that people stare at her as she walks through
the bustle of the city streets? Her warm ash grey skin, intense red
eyes. They made her too tall, too thin, and now she needs the
exo-harness in order to walk any distance. The frame keeping her
upright even during the worst of the pain. Through streets awash with
rain and neon, she feels now as though every day is an alien encounter.
These strange humans, flesh she used to know, rushing through
underground tunnels and colossal concrete structures. It all takes on
a sheen of the unknown. <P>They had adjusted her brain, her eyes, so that she could cope with the
sleeping planet - its environment green and brown, waves crashing
against sluggish shores where the gateway had deposited them. Strange
structures, riddled with the written form of the alien language. Alien
geometries that would never be entirely knowable, would never feel
entirely real. Do what you want with surgery, with training; you could
never get over that kind of "alien". Huge doorways, and Lei had been
surprised how easily the first had opened beneath Ambassador Hounjet's
touch, a career diplomat assigned to the mission, and trained in the
new field of first contact. The darkness had been alive, within a
pulsing slumbering form. Shari Hounjet had slapped her, while Dr.
Maarten Panocha looked on embarrassed, and Sergeant Hayk Iteif
remained neutral. Hounjet told her to pay attention, to stay focused
on him and his words, then he had started shouting, and the alien had
woken as Lei translated his words blindly. <P>In one ear out the other, Lei looked into the building again, had seen
tentacles, piercing red eyes, strange hoofed hands, she had heard the
flap of thick leathery wings. She had felt faint. She had felt sick.
"To me, pay attention to me," Hounjet had snapped at her again, and
she had focused on him as the alien words came. The language spoken by
a native was entirely different from what she had studied. Her mind
raced, flailing to keep up with the words, to make some form of sense
from them. They had come stumbling from her mouth, only in that last step
from her brain to her mouth clicking into place in a way that seemed
to make sense. That in the process seemed to be actually changing her
thought processes with each spoken syllable. "I am awakened. Chairman
Hu. I am. Awakened from deep slumber." Lei can't remember what she said
after that. Dr.Panocha had started screaming, while Ambassador Hounjet
fell to his knees, clawing at his eyes, and Sergeant Iteif had tried
to run. And Lei had continued to translate word for word the full
extent of the alien's response to the humans' intrusion, like a
puppet. No longer operating under her own volition. No longer
conscious of her own actions. The same way she had finally staggered through the gate home some
time after, and the next thing she remembers is the soldiers who
caught her and offered support. <P>There are rails along the walls, Lei uses them to support herself, to
pull herself along towards the bath. The exo-suit stripped, the
protective padding left behind; she shivers a little from the cold,
from the memory, from any number of involuntary reactions. She
anticipates the bath, in the same way as she hoped that it would rain
when she was out. Moisture reminds her of there, and soothes her,
warm atmosphere more suited to the body she finds herself in now. She
eases into the bath, taking great care, conscious of just how fragile
she is, lets the water cradle her and hold her, and envelop her. <P>"What happened next?" Morse asked her again and again, over and over,
every day, the good cop / bad cop interplay of Charles and Morse. With
Sundays off for good behaviour she takes advantage of being allowed
out to walk the city streets. A chorus of clicks and whirrs with every
step, she recalls, closing her eyes, hoping the water takes her away
from it all. Heads turning at every sound, stolen glances taking in
her human alien form, whisperings and confusion stalking her progress.
She brushes her body again, fingers exploring muscular pains, and
doing their best to offer relief. Plunging limbs beneath the surface,
before weakly swirling them around, embracing the tentative therapy
that offers. As the liquid warmth takes her into its embrace she
closes her eyes and sighs deeply, sliding in and down to her neck.
Perhaps she is crying now, it would not be the first time, but she is
trying to keep on top of the sensation, resist self-pity. Though for
all that, the idea of cutting her wrists and sinking into death passes
through her mind again. It is unlikely she actually would though; she
is confident the AI would trigger an alarm - undoubtedly it could
drain the bath in seconds and refill it with suspension foam,
undoubtedly in one of the neighbouring apartments where they have the
shadows housed there will be a medic; undoubtedly they have
analysed each potential scenario more thoroughly than she could. <P><p class=drop>Lei finds that she has been dozing in the bath, fatigue having caught
up with her. The water is still lukewarm, so she can't have been off
for too long. Yet it feels oddly nice, to have had a moment of peace.
She pulls herself to a standing position, pushes the button that
drains the bath, pushes the button which produces the hot air to dry
her. Clinging there as she is buffeted like a fallen leaf by the warm
blasts that come from all around her. Shivering, she steps onto the
floor, lowers herself to the bath edge and sits there, holding
herself, before building up the determination to get dressed for bed,
to see if she can get some proper sleep. Knowing with certainty that this
will absolutely not happen, but still having the resolve that she must
pretend to be as normal as she can. As she goes through these motions
she recalls this afternoon's walk, how there had been a different mood
to the city, a different buzz in the air. People had seemed too
distracted to pay her too much attention, she had passed some people
standing staring into the sky, hobbling by with her clicking
contraption, and they didn't even look. Perhaps she should have paid
more attention, but she had enough problems without being concerned by
trivia. Perhaps tonight will be different, she yawns. <P>Lei pulls herself along, using the bars, till she gets to her bedroom,
tottering with each step, a helpless child relearning the art of
walking. Reaching the bed, she crawls up, managing to cocoon herself in
the thin blanket, curling into a ball, wrapping around herself.
Closing her eyes, she steadies her breathing, absorbed in meditation
techniques she has been taught to focus and relax. As with every
night, this is enough to allow her to get to sleep in the first
instance. But it is a restless sleep; she rolls from one side to the
other, approaches awakening, hovers and dives back into dreams. Murky
images, eyes staring, alien voices insinuating themselves into her
head, strange lights, strange structures half glimpsed. <P>At last, inevitably, she finds herself awake, breathing heavily,
aching inside. That interminable presence lurking in her head, thick
and malevolent, like dirty fingers sifting through her thoughts, like
tentacled caresses. She half sits, chest heaving, spikes of pain, 
and she struggles with each breath. It takes her a
moment to notice - the silence; the darkness. From her window she can
see the city lights, hear the odd city sound now and then. In her apartment
there is always some sound, the subliminal hums and clicks of modern
living. The moon hangs in the sky, sickly and discoloured; to a degree its
diseased pallor describes a feeling that is growing in her. The silence is a blanket that becomes claustrophobic,
"lights!" she calls out. Nothing. Darkness. Silence. The feeling that
there is something in her head grows. She is not alone. There is
something here. At last. <P>Then, a sound, a slithering, a shuffling. He is here. At last. Beneath
this gibbous moon, the Chairman has come for her. Lei closes her eyes.
There was only one way that this could end, and she has known it all
along. Anticipation. They rebuilt her to travel to Slu gishgo Dhom,
the Chairman rebuilt her to return to Earth. They poked and prodded
her, tried to undo some of what had been done to her. With their
mastery of human engineering, they could not make her human again,
they could not undo the alien work. She was the Chairman's creature,
and he has come for his youngest child. Lei climbs out of bed, wobbles
in place, then gathers herself, stands steady, finding a strength she
hasn't felt in a long time. He has come for her, shuffling through
this human structure, tracking her as though she were a beacon returned to
Earth. Her presence guiding him, through dimensional fabrics. She
takes a breath, filled with a near crippling sense of anticipation.
The door opens; with a wet slapping sound, moist drops plop to the
floor, eyes red and piercing stare at her from the dark. A tentacle
furls out, lazily, brushes past her face, she smiles.  <P><small>&copy; Peter Morrison 2008 All Rights Reserved </small>
