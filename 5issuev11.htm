<div><i>Book Launch - 3rdField style</i>
<p class=drop>Patella 3rdfield sat in front of the mirror
adjusting her ear-rings: spiral swirls of diamond-dust studded with tiny
sapphires and rubies held in an invisible cloud of programmed nanogel.
She was wearing the deep blue cashmere and silk outfit which Aurelian
said matched her eyes.  Her dark blonde hair was neatly pinned back. The
ear-rings were simplified models, of course, but the accelerated
movement was detectable even under quite low magnification.  Her
daughter Paeony used to play with them when she was about nine or ten,
solemnly peering for hours in the hope of finding the black holes which
she had been told were hiding inside.  Savouring the memory, Patella
smoothed her hair, slipped on her designer floats, and glided downstairs
to where her husband was waiting patiently.  Holding her at arm&#146;s
length, he looked at her critically.  &quot;Now, do I think that was
worth waiting an extra five minutes for?  Absolutely!&quot;  They both
smiled, and set off for the launch party at Fissile &amp; Sprent.</P>
<P>Morton Quanderpyre was already there, his voice booming above the
hubbub.</P>  <P><P>&quot;&#133;about as much panache as a shrivelled stoat!
Where&#146;s the artistry, the finesse, eh, Croles?  In <I>my</I> day &#150; and
yours I dare say, there used to be a great deal more preparation, more
<I>honing</I>.  Now it&#146;s all manic capering and caterwauling.&quot;
Trafford Croles, veteran actor, murmured his agreement while
unobtrusively craning to look past Quanderpyre&#146;s shoulder, where the
Spandrels were making their flamboyant entrance.  Agathon and Ludmilla
had already flounced in, each with glossy dark hair fanned out into a
halo.  They were clad in cerise taffeta with glints of emerald at head
and foot.  Thor followed, in his customary black tunic and belt wth
silver clasp, wearing his mirrored shades, then Wu Ying in something
scantily diaphanous under her prismatic cloak, and Pepito, Milton and
Scapula; all three in bioluminescent garments pulsing in phase.  Miss
Derbyshire wore a multi-fringed dark crimson dress whose edges
coruscated with fractal sparks, and lastly came little Clint, under an
enveloping dome of a hat, apparently disguised as a bipedal
mushroom.</P>
<P>Sprent wondered how the Spandrels had managed to find their way on to
the guest list.  He did not doubt their celebrity status, or their
appeal to the vidkid generation, but to the best of his knowledge they
had no literary credentials.  And if it were not for his enormous wealth
and media influence, that noisy oaf Quanderpyre would have been
excluded.  Had old Creg Fissile still been alive, he would have ensured
a more stringent check on the invitations, and would probably also have
stationed security guards with identipads at the door.  On the other
hand, Sprent reflected, the humourless Fissile, for all his probity and
pursuit of excellence, would very likely have overlooked the potential
popularity of Patella 3rdfield&#146;s work, which he, Pentheus Sprent, was
quietly proud to have been among the first to recognize.</P>

 <P>He glanced up at the ads spinning slowly round the walls, blossoming
 and dissolving:<P> <P> <P>A sudden burst of applause by the entrance prompted guests to turn
 towards the arched doorway.  And there they were!  Sprent strode
 forward to greet them, beaming.  &quot;Ah, Patella, our guest of
 honour, and Aurelian, welcome!  We are truly privileged.  <I>So
 </I>good to see you both. Patella, you are looking lovely!  And
 Aurelian, <I>so</I> distinguished.  I heard that you have become part
 of Dizmin Harf&#146;s repertoire &#150; quite an accolade.  Now, Patella&#133;&quot;
 He led them away, animatedly outlining the order of proceedings.</P>
<P>The evening was quite a success. Patella judiciously kept her speech
short, the champagne flowed, multimedia sales of &#145;Hoolocks and Hellions&#146;
were satisfyingly brisk.  Quanderpyre tried to corner Pentheus Sprent,
seeking another sounding-board for his unsolicited opinions, but
fortunately the Spandrels intervened, sweeping between them on their way
out in a scintillating, lurid flurry of colour, like some wayward
ceremonial Chinese dragon, followed by what appeared to be a swiftly
moving inverted wok.</P>
<P>Trafford Croles still possessed the easy charm which had endeared him
to an earlier generation.  He was comfortable with adulation, and mildly
resented having to watch it bestowed on others.  Rationally, he allowed
that Patella 3rdfield deserved her triumph, but as she was only a
writer, he had no cause to be jealous.  What he found irksome was that
hardly anyone in this gathering seemed to recognize <I>him</I>, even
though he had been standing profiled against an illuminated patch of
wall, simply exuding charisma, and ready to share the unique benefits of
his accrued wisdom and theatrical experience.  He sipped the last few
drops from his fourth glass of champagne; about the only thing here
which probably matched his own age, he thought morosely.  That ghastly
Quanderpyre had briefly loomed in front of him, complaining about
something or other, then the peculiar but eye-catching Spandrels had
trooped in, creating something of a distraction until the 3rdfields
arrived.  Sprent had acknowledged him with a polite wave of the hand,
but apart from that he was virtually ignored.  It gradually dawned on
him, as he casually abstracted another glass from a passing tray, that
most of the people here were far too young to remember his stage
appearances, and unless they were historians, too preoccupied with their
own concerns to bother with anything screened before trid or holo.  He
blinked up at the relentlessly revolving ads, and still clutching his
glass with automatic care, slid slowly to the floor.</P>
<P>Aurelian and Patella, having duly circulated independently,
eventually found themselves together again, to their mutual relief.
&quot;How was it for you?&quot; asked Patella, with solicitous good
humour.   <P><P>&quot;Oh, bearable,&quot; her husband replied.  &quot;Frankly,
I was pleased not to be the object of attention; it meant that unlike
you, I could choose the people I wanted to speak to.  I had an
interesting chat with P&aring;r S&oslash;derstr&oslash;m, the designer.
Did you know he breeds miniature giraffes?  But what about you, Pat? You
must be exhausted.&quot;   <P><P>She smiled, then stifled a yawn. &quot;Oh, I&#146;m
fine.  They were all very kind.  Some of the younger ones are a bit
awe-struck and tongue-tied at first, but their questions are quite
thoughtful.  Sprent looks very pleased with himself, so I suppose we can
say it went well, despite the occasional sound of Morton Quanderpyre&#146;s
bellowing.  I&#146;m not quite sure what he was doing here, or the Spandrels,
for that matter, although they did look rather striking.&quot; <P><P>&quot;They enjoy showing off, &quot; said Aurelian, &quot;and they&#146;re
a
bit of a cult with the  
vidkids.  Unlike poor old Croles,&quot; he said
sympathetically, nodding toward the crumpled figure against the far
wall, whose snores were distinctly audible across the room.  &quot;Do
you remember how Paeony used to love those old pompous pre-trid
performances of his when she was little?&quot;  <P><P>&quot;I was thinking
about her earlier ths evening,&quot; Patella said, gently fingering an
ear-ring.  &quot;Shall we go home?&quot;</P> <P>
