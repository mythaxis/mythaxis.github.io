<p class="drop">"Don't feel too bad, Doctor Alvarez. It's
not the first time we've seen that reaction." <P>"I just didn't
see this advance coming," Alberto Alvarez said, shaking his head with
something approaching despair. Harriet Bali offered him a sympathetic
smile.  <P>"When they thought technology would get bigger-instead, it went micro.
When it was thought we'd be working less hours, enjoying more leisure
hours-the opposite occurred. Overpopulating the Earth-and we hit a
crisis in the birth-rate and increased incidence of male impotency."  <P>The last made Alberto shiver with unease, and he saw Harriet lower her
head to hide a smile.  <P>"Doctor Alvarez. Please. We really appreciate your presence here.
Without it, we'd still be fighting for official recognition and
acceptance of what we've achieved. We're hoping that, with your
collaboration, we can maximise the potential of the Stargaze Process."  <P>Alberto shook himself.
He nodded.  <P>"Of course. I'm sorry. And, let me also say I'm honoured to be invited
here to witness the process in action. I know the
media, the movies, would have scientists always pooh-poohing any new
breakthrough that wasn't their own, but it's not always like that. Those
that take to badmouthing others' achievements are invariably those who
are trying to defend their own previously-announced discoveries. The
rest of us still remember what it's like to love the field we've chosen
to work in. We get just as excited as anyone, therefore, when there's a
major breakthrough."  <P>The Stargaze Process easily qualified in the 'major breakthrough'
category. It had broken through more than just scientific boundaries-it
had broken through the confines of their own known universe. And beyond. <P>
In layman's terms: why leap into a
rocket and travel to the stars, when you could send your eyes to distant
galaxies from the confines of your own living room in order to
experience it for you?  <P>Of course, it was rather more complex
than just packaging your senses and posting them into the heavens. And
for 'living room', read the 'Stargaze Main Projects Room'.  <P>When
you delved deeper into the science of it all, you found the only thing
that was truly simple was the rather crass-but infinitely sellable-name
they'd given the whole endeavour: <i>Stargaze.</i> The marketing boys
and girls had clearly been sitting in on the meeting <i>that</i> day. <P> 
<p class=drop>"Here," Harriet said. "We nicknamed
the part that's positioned in front of the gazer's face <i>'the silver
carrot'</i>. Due solely to its shape, I assure you."  <P>"Quite,"
Alberto said, craning round to observe where the thicker end of the
carrot would slide forward to cover the subject's face. The carrot was
hollow and horizontal, so you could look straight down its reducing
cone. "It seems much longer than it really is when you look at it on the
inside." It had a corkscrew rib, running like the bore on the barrel of
a rifle. "Quite the optical illusion. Mirrors?"  <P>"Kind of,"
Harriet said with a smile. "It's to encourage the mind to reach further.
As the carrot turns, the senses are drawn out. Like drawing silk from a
silk worm without, in the process, killing the worm."  <P>"But
nothing is actually 'removed'?"  <P>"No. It's merely to help the
senses to stretch. Picture it like standing on a hilltop on a perfectly
clear day and letting your ears reach out and focus in order to hear the
sound of a car horn in a city a hundred kilometres away."  <P>He
smiled back. "Hardly the same, I imagine."  <P>"Hah! No, I'm afraid
that image is rather prosaic rather than accurate on two counts.
Firstly, there's no sense of sounds reaching the ear-rather the ear
going in search of them. The other is the distances involved. For a
hundred kilometres read&#8230; well, <i>'considerably further'</i>.
Would you care to take the seat and try it for yourself?"  <P>"That's why I'm here," Alberto said. But getting into the chair was more
awkward than it looked. His frame was accustomed to being hunched over a
keyboard rather than contorting to fit what resembled a kind of cockpit. <P>
Apt, considering the distance part of him was due to travel. <P>
"There you go. Just slide down until the back of your neck
feels the padded rim."  <P>"I feel like I'm about to have a
haircut," Alberto said shakily.  <P>"You're not the first to draw
that comparison. The chair's quite comfortable when you get into place.
And when the process starts, you won't be aware of it at all."  <P>"You've tried it?"  <P>"Just try stopping me!" Harriet said, her
smile peeling her lips back to reveal a healthy set of gums too. "Who
doesn't want to throw their mind out into space, see what's out there?
Starting with the stars we see in our night sky, and then beyond even
them? Currently, we have no idea just how far the Process might let us
see."  <P>"It's curious. I mean: all that stuff about remote
viewing, out of body experiences? I'm told it's not like any of that." <P>
"The Russians ran programs in the Cold War to test
extra-sensory abilities. Hitler had his scientists looking into the
occult. The Americans had Oppenheimer. Teflon came about because of the
space program. Science is forever a weird and wonderful innovator." They
shared a smile.  <P>Although Harriet had been charged with
personally showing Alberto around, it was clear she shared his love of
the new and admired those daring to not just ask but <i>see</i> if it
were possible.  <P>Well, with the possible exception of Hitler and
Stalin, the megalomaniac sadists.  <P>"Okay?" Harriet asked and
Alberto nodded. She turned and raised a hand to someone the other side
of the one-way mirror behind them. "They're going to start the Process
now, Doctor Alvarez. Just look straight forward. You don't need to focus
on anything--your senses will adapt automatically. In turns out our
senses were equipped with this ability all along. We've always suspected
they were once far more potent or had hidden depths we simply stopped
using or forgot how to tap into&#8230; Stargaze merely facilitates their
release, as it were."  <P>As the silver carrot slowly began to
turn, Alberto chuckled.  <P>"Excuse me for saying so, but this
reminds me of some mind-control apparatus, or the torture device, used
in some old spy film. James Bond was it? Back when Sean Connery or Roger
Moore was still playing the part?"  <P>"You're wondering if it
could all just be a form of hypnotism? That's understandable. The mind
can play funny tricks, even on itself. Think of all those convinced they
were Cleopatra in a past life due to regression therapy. I can assure
you, though, you'll be able to tell the difference. Once you feel it
start to happen, you'll know it's genuine.  <P>"You'll be in
control at all times. The initial 'pulling' part of the process is only
to ease your senses out to a state where they might reach further. At
first, you'll feel the momentum build, like your senses are pressing
behind your eyes-then they'll just snake out as easy as party streamers
from a compressed gas canister."  <P>"And when I want to come
back?"  <P>"Like I said: you're in control. Don't worry if the
first time the sensation gets the better of you and you snap back quite
quickly-it's quite unnerving and it can take time to build up confidence
to let it all just happen naturally. If you're worried you won't know
<i>how</i> to pull yourself back, then don't: various instruments are
monitoring your heartbeat, breathing, brain activity&#8230; If we see
anything at all to alert us that the experience is anything but
pleasant, and we'll bring you straight back."  <P>"How?"
 
 She tapped the carrot. <i>"'What's up doc?'</i>" she said in a passable
Bugs Bunny voice. "Just like a fairground ride: we'll stop it spinning."
Alberto laughed at her impersonation and settled back down again.  <P>He had expected the effect to build slowly, almost like the thing
was drilling a steady hole through a thickly-reinforced wall. But it
happened quickly. And so smoothly, Alberto realised at once that
Harriet's assertion had been true: this was a natural ability they all
possessed. Like a baby thrown into a swimming pool instinctively opened
its eyes, held its breath&#8230;and then <i>swam.</i>  <P>Alberto
swam forward.  <P>At least, his senses did. Momentarily, it felt as
if his eyes were bulging, suddenly full of liquid before they oozed out
of his sockets in long, horizontal flagella whose ends flowered and
burst and then were pulled forward, still somehow connected to his
optical nerves, to the part of his brain where all this information was
processed.  <P>They rushed down the endless silver funnel and then,
wonderfully, his vision exited the carrot as if it had been nothing more
than a barrel to shoot his eyes out.  <P>He found himself far above
his own planet.  <P><i>Already?</i> How could he have leapt so far
already? He had only just been stretching to the tip of that carrot, and
that was barely a metre and a half long. Maybe two, if he'd actually
taken the effort to measure it and examine the schematics before taking
his seat. Surprising him further, his mind had accompanied them rather
than just waiting for the filmed information to be transmitted back to
it.  <P>He looked down and saw what Armstrong, Aldrin and others
had marvelled at. It was a familiar image to anyone who'd ever picked up
a book on astronomy. But, just like seeing an animal in the flesh
compared to seeing one on a postcard, the real thing was an entirely
different experience. And the animal analogy wasn't an erroneous one:
that planet, that incredible sculpture of blues and greens and whites,
was a living thing.  <P>It gave one an understanding, a humbling
appreciation of what Earth truly was. Gave you cause to believe in the
miraculous once again.  <P>The vision fed his senses and he
acknowledged that more than his eyes were out here to process what he
witnessed. And that a living thing always recognised another that shared
its miracle of existence.  <P><i> Always.</i> <P><p class=drop><i>"Doctor Alvarez?"</i> The rapping on the
door was a mixture of knuckle and the soft flesh that peaked below the
little finger when you made a fist. It came again, the rhythm choosing
to become that deliberate pounding you got with a bad hangover.  <P><i>The baddest hangover of them all.</i>  <P><i> "Doc. Tor. Al. Va.
Rez. It's me. Harriet Bali. Please. I only want to talk to you. Doctor
Alvarez?" </i>  <P>Alberto hurried over and crouched down to
replace the black-sock draught-excluders he'd placed along the bottom of
the door and which Harriet's enthusiastic banging had dislodged. It
wasn't to keep breezes out. Nor in. It was to reduce the light. The
curtains had been drawn, pinned, then covered by blankets looped over
the curtain-rails and held in place with pegs and duct-tape. But even
with his shades on it was still too bright.  <P>Too
<i>illuminated.</i>  <P><i>"Doctor Alvarez-I got the key from the
janitor. I'm sorry, Doctor Alvarez, but everyone's extremely worried
about you. I persuaded them to let me come alone. To talk to you. So I
could assure them you were alright." </i>  <P>"Nooooo!" Alberto
moaned when he realised what she intended and turned so he sat with his
back to the door.  <P><i>"Alberto. Listen to me: if I can't tell
them you're okay, they'll send others here. Those others will very
likely take you away with them. They'll ask you questions and won't let
you go home until you've answered them." </i>  <P>There was a pause
and he heard her swallow, pictured her collecting herself.  <P><i>"Doctor Alvarez-if they think you're sick, then they maybe won't let
you
go home again afterwards. Do you understand? After the way you ran
off&#8230;without saying anything&#8230; People need answers, Doctor
Alvarez. There's a lot riding on this. You were the official witness to
what Stargaze is trying to do." </i>  <P>"I don't want to!" He
craned his neck round to scream it at the door. "I don't want to! You
can't make me!"  <P><i>"You have no choice, Doctor."</i> He heard
the sigh in her voice. The exasperation. He looked at how his hands
trembled. Even in the darkness they seemed to displace the air in black
waves.  <P>"If I talk to you? You'll tell them? You'll tell them to
leave me alone?"  <P><i> "If you tell me what we need to
know&#8230; Then I promise you, I'll do all I can." </i>  <P>"You
promise?"  <P><i>"All I can,"</i> she confirmed.
 
He rolled
away from the door and got to his feet. He was wearing his dressing gown
over a thick jumper, baggy green corduroys, three pairs of socks on his
feet. On his head was the brown felt hat with earflaps he wore when he
went fishing. The sunglasses were wide, wraparound ones, bought for an
aborted skiing holiday fifteen years ago.  <P>He was glad he'd
never gone. He never wanted to even <i>think</i> about being up so high
again.  <P>"I'm opening the door," he told her. "Get ready." He
opened it a crack, pulling his head back like he was avoiding the
searing heat from a partially opened oven. "Quickly. Get in. Quickly." <P>
The sight he must have been. The way he'd barricaded himself in
here. It was understandable when Harriet hesitated. But as he became
frantic, as he made it look like the door would be closed again, she
nodded, and squeezed through the gap.  <P>He shut the door after
her, stuck black masking tape back down the seam and worked it into the
crack, then kicked the black sausages over the gap at the bottom of the
door.  <P>"It's too dark," Harriet said. "I can't see you." <P>"Your eyes will adjust&#8230;" It was just one of the many things
your eyes kept secret from you that they could do. "You'll get used to
it."  <P>"Maybe my sense of sight, but not my sense of smell," she
muttered, not quiet enough to avoid him hearing it. There was obviously
plenty of annoyance burning away inside Harriet Bali for the predicament
he'd placed her in when he'd woken from his stargaze, ripped himself
from the chair, and then ran out the building like his hair was on fire
and with nothing available to dowse the flames.  <P>"You want a
drink?" he asked.  <P>"No. Just an explanation."
 
"You can
sit down."  <P>"Where?"
 
"There's a chair behind you. It's
okay, there's nothing in it. It may smell a bit stuffy in here, but
everything's clean, I assure you."  <P>"Okay." He watched her swing
a hand about until it bounced off the arm of the chair and then felt her
way round to its seat. "Can't we just have a <i>bit</i> of light? Not
even a candle's worth?"  <P>"No."
 
"Is it because of what
happened? We tested the machine after you'd sat in it and it hadn't
malfunctioned. No one else has had a bad reaction when using it. Are you
sure you weren't suffering from some condition before you came to see
us?"  <P>In three quick sentences, she'd run the entire gambit of
corporate arse-covering.  <P>"The equipment worked just fine. That
wasn't it."  <P>"I'm relieved to hear you say that, Doctor Alvarez.
It would have been a lot better for us, though, had you stayed around
long enough to say that to our Board. Or responded to their frequent
requests for an explanation since. You're a scientist--"  <P>"Am
I?" he asked her. "Are any of us what we really think we are?" The
silence that came after indicated this wasn't the type of question
Harriet was capable of answering. Nor the type she had come here to
ponder with him.  <P>"Then I'm supposing it's something you saw on
your travels?"  <P>"Yes. Yes, that's it exactly."
 
"Space
is a vast, unexplored area. And we're the pioneers. I warned you it
could be disorientating. What exactly did you see?"  <P>"Life." A
simple word, but the most potent in all galaxies. The biggest miracle of
them all. The one that made a supernova nothing more than a flaring
matchhead.  <P>"But that's every scientist's dream, Doctor Alvarez!
My God! I mean, we traced your route afterwards, but we never
thought&#8230;"  <P>"What? What did you say? Traced my..? No one
told me that you could find out where we went?"  <P>"Well, the
tracing process takes time. We can't just follow you by pointing one of
ourselves in your direction. There are a billion tiny alternations in an
individual's chosen route that could throw us into another galaxy
entirely. But the computer records your movements, plots a path, as it
were, so we can do it that way. We're not just pioneers, but
cartographers."  <P>"But no one's gone where I went?" he asked
frantically, both hands curling fingers over an invisible bar set before
him.  <P>"Not yet. But&#8230;<i>Life?</i> If that's what you saw,
we have no choice but to investigate it, do we? It's the Holy Grail of
space travel."  <P>"You mustn't!" Her saw her wince at the volume
of his voice. "Don't you see? You simply mustn't!"  <P>"Doctor
Alvarez. I, we've, been patient with you. But wailing words of doom
isn't going to cut much with us. We're scientists. So, please, give me a
reason to think <i>you're</i> still capable of thinking like one too." <P>
"Okay, okay. Yes." He looked towards the door, seeing neither
escape nor sanctuary. There were no doors. No boundaries, anymore. And
as for windows&#8230; "I'll tell you. But you must believe me. And
then&#8230;then you must stop them from trying. They mustn't go there.
It could ruin everything. For everyone."  <P>"I'm listening." <P>"I went. Out there. It was just like you said it would be. I looked
down on the Earth and it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
Then I turned away and went further. I didn't have the sensation I was
choosing a direction as such, just that I felt some urge to go towards
one particular star. There was nothing about it that was remarkable. If
anything, it was dimmer, more distant than others more immediately
approachable. But for some reason I was attracted to it.  <P>"I
<i>hurried</i> there. I passed through vast amounts of space and in so
doing I passed through a similar quantity of time. I didn't move
backwards and forwards in time, I merely mean that for such vast
distances to be travelled, time has to be bent the same way light is
influence by the effects of gravity.  <P>"I couldn't pull up from
my trajectory even had I wanted to. I certainly couldn't alter my path.
I was going to see what was on the principal planet orbiting that star,
like it or not.  <P>"Because it wasn't me flying my senses out
there. It was something else&#8230;something that was pulling me in." <P><p class=drop>"You mean this, whatever it was, had
caught you, or that it was attracting you in some way?"  <P>He saw
Harriet was holding back from expressing outright scepticism. The
Stargaze Process was new, so how could they discount anything until they
knew the full scope of its possibilities and what might actually be out
there?  <P>"I mean&#8230;" He didn't complete his sentence.
Instead, he changed scenes in the story, switching to another memory
camera, as it were. "I came in closer and closer and the planet grew
more distinct as I descended. It was green in places-but emerald, not
the softer greens of Earth. And the seas were a darker, shinier blue. It
was as if the planet were wrapped in different coloured foils. There
were silver patches too: irregular and without pattern.  <P>"But
when I was close enough, the silver tarnished to a light grey. Like the
shading of a graphite pencil? It still glinted in places but was not
metallic--but like shells. Because that's what they turned out to be. <P>
"Down I went. Down, down. I thought I was going to crash into
that mass of grey shingle, but that would have made a nonsense out of
what I was whilst I was travelling in that realm. As you told me: I was
nothing but a satellite of sorts from my own mind. So I slowed, braking
hard-but as with all that happens with your process, it was a smooth
sensation of deceleration.  <P>"And then I was amongst them. <P>"Their shells wore whirls like on the outside of a snail's shell.
But these shells were also far more rounded, larger too-each about the
size of a beach ball. They were mottled, tortoiseshell, each marked
differently but cast from the same basic design, but limited by the same
limited choice of colours. And from each shell extended a soft-limbed
creature like a sea anemone, or a snail that had sprouted many tentacles
or antennae rather than just the customary two. The creatures were a
light orange, with green threads running through them which I don't
think carried blood but were instead flows of nutrients from the
pale-green mossy plant-life they were grazing upon.  <P>"The
tentacles quivered in the air, not feeling for me, but rather for each
other and that fuzz they fed upon. They were blind in our terms of
sight, and as I looked around I saw that only those nearest me were
moving. The rest of them were still, but the shells not dull, but shiny,
filled with living creatures as they were.  <P>"Those others seemed
to be sleeping.  <P>"There was one though that had turned towards
me. <i>Sensed</i> me. I knew it was the one that had drawn me here and I
wanted to ask it why it had done so. How it had known of me, felt me out
there&#8230;"  <P>"You think it possessed some sensitivity of its
own?" Harriet suggested. "Or that it simply possessed the same talent
we've discovered in ourselves but that it didn't require some slowly
spinning silver carrot to achieve it?"  <P>"No." Alberto's denial
was short, sharp, adamant. "Because there is no 'talent' we possess. Not
the way you've all been thinking of it. That creature wasn't calling out
to me. That thing was bringing me back. It wasn't trying to communicate
with Doctor Alberto Alvarez. It <i>was</i> Doctor Alberto Alvarez. Or,
rather: I am a part of it. We're not the ones extending our thoughts out
there, Ms Bali. <i>They're</i> extending their thoughts, their senses
out <i>here</i>."  <P>"That's impossible!" Harriet said shaking her
head. "I mean, come on&#8230;"  <P>"I'm not saying we're just their
senses. Nor that we're just their dreams. We're living, breathing
creatures. We live, we die, just like any other living thing. But
haven't you ever wondered what it is <i>really</i> that sets us apart
from the other living creatures that share this planet with us? Not just
our superior intelligence-which has always been obvious-but why we do
things like imagine, create, argue over semantics and philosophy, and
concern ourselves with abstract concepts such as reason, justice, mercy? <P>
"It's them. That part of us responsible for all that I've
mentioned isn't us. We're just the animal part. The monkey or tree shrew
we were further down the chain. Take away that different part<i>
they</i> provide, and we're just another version of our evolutionary
ancestors once more. If we have a soul at all, then it's the sensory
ability those things are projecting into us."  <P>"You're saying
we're slaves of snails?" Harriet asked, and despite her earlier attempts
to avoid stooping to such tactics, the sarcastic scepticism was now out
and having its voice. "Rubbish! That would mean they themselves had
directed us to make a machine which would, in turn, find them again!" <P>
"I&#8230;I can't figure that bit," Alberto said, rubbing
vigorously at his temples as if something squirmed and chewed there. It
probably did at that. "Maybe we possess our own residual intelligence.
Maybe, over the years, we've grown capable of such thought in our own
right. I only know they're out there. That we're not really who we think
we are&#8230;"  <P>"Then why would you be talking to me about this
now? Why would you think it makes any difference if I'm just another
snail-person, controlled by a remote server?"  <P>"I'm not sure.
Maybe because they don't have the control over us they once did.
Scientists, maybe some people with greater mental abilities, or maybe
those who think too much on these types of things, might be getting free
of them. Maybe some of us can't be controlled the way we once were." <P>
"<i>Some</i> of us?" Harriet asked. "No one else has had your
experience, Doctor Alvarez."  <P>"But they might do. I mean: if
they ride the Stargazer the way I did&#8230;"  <P>"On the other
hand, what you're suggesting would make the Stargaze Process the perfect
way to find out who had this peculiar talent of independence, of
defiance, don't you think?"  <P>Though he expected it to be there,
he realised any trace of sarcasm had gone.  <P>"Not 'some' having
such a unique capability, Doctor Alvarez," she told him. "Just one. We
had to be sure about you though."  <P>"No! You&#8230;I have to go.
To warn people!"  <P>"No, Doctor Alvarez. I'm afraid you're not
going anywhere. Not anymore." Harriet Bali smiled, slowly. At a snail's
pace. "<i>'Monkey and tree shrew'</i>, indeed&#8230;"  <P>
