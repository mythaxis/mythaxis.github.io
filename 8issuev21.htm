<p class="drop">Junho set down the knight tile on the
board with a
clack. "Checkmate."  <P>Alice clapped while smiling, her
pink robe sleeves flapping around. "Good job, big brother. You
finally beat me."  <P>"I don't get you. You're happy
even though I won, and somehow, I don't feel all that glad." Junho
rested his chin on his hand. The warm afternoon rays from the
window behind him made the orange-black fur on his ears glow
golden.  <P>"That's because you take this too seriously.
It's a game. It's supposed to be fun."  <P>"You've been
talking to Mizael again, haven't you?" He crossed his arms,
wrinkling the elbows of his Western suit.  <P>"What's
wrong with that?"  <P>"Nothing, I suppose." Junho rotated
the King tile between his fingers. "It's just, he's a Makuranian.
Zangi is a game that simulates war. Someone who never had a war
fought on their own homeland wouldn't understand us. He can think
it's fun, but I can't help but take it seriously."  <P>
Alice fell silent for a while. She didn't really know how to deal
with her older brother when it came to war. "Don't worry about it
too much. It's not like this game really matters."  <P>
"You're right. I got worked up for no reason. Sorry."  <P>
A rumbling came from outside. They turned to the window. A line of
spider tanks marched through the dirt road by their house. Gravel
crunched under the weight of their metallic grey legs. A little girl
ran out into the street chasing after a ball. Her mother pulled her
back before she reached the tanks' procession, and the ball was
flattened under the tanks. She cried as her mother dragged her into
their tiny house. The papers said the Oblivion War was over four
years ago, but that didn't mean war had ended.  <P>
"Sometimes I wonder whom this country belongs to. We just traded the
Solradian occupiers for the Makuranians," Junho said.  <P>
"Someone's got to maintain law and order. It can't be helped," Alice
said.  <P>Junho continued staring at the tanks and
clenched his fist. What if it could be helped? Alice was afraid of
the answer to Junho's unspoken question. Everyone had lost so much.
She didn't want to see anyone else lose anything.  <P>
Someone knocked on the papered sliding door.  <P>"You may
enter," Alice said.  <P>A middle-aged servant in white
robes slid the door open and bowed, his tail flat on the ground.
"Young Lady, Young Master. The Count has a message for you. The
Makuranian Deputy Minister of State will be at five o'clock. Please
prepare to greet him."  <P>"Thanks, Kyuhan," Junho said. <P>Kyuhan closed the door. <P>"What time is
it?" Junho asked.  <P>Alice grabbed the pocket watch
chained to her sash. "Four fifty. Straighten your tie. Comb your
hair too." She looked around. "Let's see. What else&#133;" Everything had
to look perfect for Minister McLazarus.  <P>Junho put his
hand on her shoulder. "Relax. I know you like Mizael, but you don't
need to go overboard to look good in front of his father." <P>Her
heart screamed. Alice's face flushed and turned hot.
"W-what are you saying, big brother? There's no way I like Mizael." <P>
He sighed. "Whatever. Just follow the usual
procedures we do for foreign diplomats, and we'll be fine." <P>  <P> They headed out to the lobby area, where the white
 crystals of Western alchemic chandeliers shined brilliantly. The muted
 red wood and the golden lines around the columns were garish in the
 face of such bright light.  <P>The front door slid
open. A blond human in an expensive-looking suit followed by two men
in sunglasses entered. He raised his hand above his crisp, combed
hair. "Ugh. I told Count Lee that these lights were a bad idea. He
never listens, does he?"  <P>Alice wanted to nod, but she
couldn't embarrass her father like that publicly. She and Junho
bowed to Minister McLazarus. "Welcome to the Avalon Inn."  <P> <P> "Oh, you two must be Count Lee's children," Minister
McLazarus said.  <P>Junho's striped tail twitched, but Alice
remained silent.  <P>One of
the bodyguards whispered in his ear.  <P>"Ah, yes. Junho
and Alice."  <P>"The Count is expecting you," Junho said.
"We'll show you to your room, and a messenger will come for you when
he is ready to receive you." <P>The Minister and his
bodyguards followed Alice and Junho through a corridor and around
the corner. A few of the staff ladies whispered as the Minister
passed by the unlit wooden halls.  <P>"This is your room,
Sir," Alice said as she turned the knob and opened the door for him. <P>"And my guards?" <P>Junho gestured to the room next door. "They'll be close
by, rest assured." <P>"Good."  <P>A young girl in an orange staff robe
approached them. "Welcome, Minister McLazarus. I'll be your service
staff for your stay. Just ring the bell in your room if you need
anything."  <P>Alice rushed next to her and whispered,
"Yuna, the bow!"  <P>Yuna hurriedly bowed ninety degrees,
her twin-tailed hair swinging around. "Sorry."  <P>
"Apologies, Sir. She only started today," Alice said.  <P>
"As long as she can do the work, I don't mind," the Minister said.
He handed his suitcase to his bodyguards and stepped into the room.
The guards inspected the entire room, even testing the ceiling
panels in the closet.  <P>After getting the Minister and
guards settled in, Alice and Junho returned to Alice's room. They
sat across from each other at a low table. The sun had almost set.
Dark grey clouds gathered over the horizon, and a dull grey light
passed through the window.  <P>"What do you suppose the
Minister came to talk about?" Alice said.  <P>"Judging
from the tanks, I'd say it's about how to strengthen Radiaurora, or
at least this side of it. Maybe they think the dwarves will make a
move soon," Junho said.  <P>"I hope there's no fighting.
Why can't the Dwalvic Union just leave already?"  <P>"I
imagine some of us Radiaurorans on the west side are saying the same
thing about Makuran."  <P>"Excuse me," Kyuhan said from
outside the door.  <P>"What is it?" Alice asked.  <P> <P> "I'm here to inform you of my absence this evening."  <P> <P> "For what reason?"  <P>"It's the thirtieth
anniversary of my father's death. I'm going to visit his grave. The
Count has given his permission."  <P>"I see. Be safe on
your journey," Alice said.  <P>"Yes, young lady."
Kyuhan's footsteps trailed off.  <P>Alice and Junho
played a few more rounds of Zangi to pass the time. At some point, a
group of footsteps passed by the room, and the Minister's voice was
saying something in Ilysveilan that Alice couldn't completely
understand.  <P>"Agree&#133;. purge&#133; plan&#133; tonight."   <P>After their games, they each took to
reading their own
books. Alice flipped open to her bookmark in <i>No Longer Human</i>.
Junho
was absorbed in <i>The Odyssey of Hong Gildong</i>, not even looking up
as
Alice stared at him. She focused back on her own reading; it was
best to let him have his peace in his own little world.  <P>Alice clapped her book closed and looked out the window.
It was completely black outside, a new moon, as Mizael called it. Rain
pelleted their window like bullets. The darkness itself was flowing,
carrying with it memories of the war.  <P>"Well, it's
time to turn in. Good night," Junho said.  <P>"Good
night."  <P>He slid the door closed behind him as he
left. Alice pulled the cord on the ceiling light and crawled into
bed. Sleeping in a bed, soft, was indeed superior to sleeping on the
floor in a futon. Perhaps she also had Mizael to thank for that.
After all, her father had only begun to modernize this inn after he
came. Reminded of what Junho had said earlier, she cleared her head
and sank into slumber.  <P><p class=drop>The next morning, Alice awoke
to some commotion down the hall. She slid open her door and headed
to the source of the noise.  <P>Several staff ladies were whispering to each other outside the
Minister's room. One of them was hugging Yuna tight as she cried. The
bodyguards hung their heads low. Alice rushed over.
	
"What's going on?" <P>"Young lady,
you should not see this," Nina said. The elderly chief maid held
Alice's hand.  <P>She broke free and looked, anyway.
Minister McLazarus lay dead in a pool of his own blood. Alice
staggered back and braced herself against the wall. The bloodshed
was supposed to have ended.  <P>Junho ran up to them. "I
heard what happened. Has the Count been informed?"  <P>"S&#249;khua has been sent for him," Nina said.  <P>A cane
rapped on the wooden floor. Her father approached from down the
hall, escorted by S&#249;khua. Her father wore a stern expression,
further creasing his wrinkly forehead. His greying goatee bore a
resemblance to that of solemn Western gods.  <P>"Move
aside," he said.  <P>Alice, Junho, and the staff all
backed away from the room. Her father looked at the gruesome scene
for some time. He turned to them.  <P>"S&#249;khua, telephone
the Makuranian embassy and inform them of what's happened. The rest
of you, return to your duties. Do not enter this room. We'll let the
police find the truth."  <P>"Yes, my lord," S&#249;khua said.
He brushed aside the bangs of his wavy hair and walked off with
haste and elegance. The Western butler suit looked too good on him. <P>The staff dispersed, and Alice and Junho returned to
her room.  <P>"Looks like it hasn't been reported in the
paper yet." Junho held up the June 25, 1949 issue of the Radiaurora
Daily.  <P>"We only found out this morning," Alice said. <P>"It'll probably be in an
extra by the afternoon,"
Junho said.  <P>"How could this have happened here?"
Alice looked down.  <P>"The war never really ended. I
hate to say it, but as a Makuranian minister, he probably had a lot
of people who wanted to kill him, even if he hadn't done anything." <P>
An hour later, Mizael blazed through the front,
yelling, "Where's my father? Take me to him."  <P>Alice
and Junho went out to the front.  <P>"Mizael, I'm so
sorry," Alice said. She avoided his eyes; she didn't know how to
look at him after what had happened.  <P>Two human men in
grey uniforms and caps entered behind Mizael. "Please step aside and
let us do the investigating."  <P>Mizael shook his head,
his spiky blond hair shaking. "I want to see his body." Clad in a
trench coat, he wore all black, as though he were already in
mourning.  <P>"You may look, but you must not interfere.
Come with us," one of the military police officers said.  <P>
 They all went to the room where the Minister lay dead. <P>
 Mizael clenched his fist. "What about the murder weapon?" <P>
The officer put his hand on Mizael's shoulder. "Leave
the investigating to us. We'll make sure the culprit is brought to
justice."  <P>The two officers entered the room and
closed the door behind them.  <P>Mizael turned to Alice
and Junho, his normally clear blue eyes now icy. "Tell me everything
you know."  <P>"We shouldn't talk here. Let's go to
Alice's room," Junho said.  <P>They sat on tatami mats
around the table in Alice's room. The mournful heavens continued
pouring outside.  <P>She couldn't bear to see Mizael like
this, so Alice broke the awkward silence. "Have you lost someone
before?"  <P>Mizael looked away and down. "Ah, you could
tell? Before I came here, my mother passed away from pneumonia.
My father was the only one I had. And now, I have no one."  <P>
"We can't promise anything," Junho said. "But if it will
make you feel better, we'll tell you everything that happened."  <P> <P> He sat up straight. "Please do."  <P>Alice and
Junho told him what they remembered of last night.  <P>
"So my father arrives at five. You hear him leave his room and go
past your room, but you don't hear him come back. You went to sleep
at eleven? When
do you think he left his room?"  <P>"Nine thirty," Junho
said.  <P>"How are you sure? You said neither of you
checked the time."  <P>"Dinner services end at nine
thirty. I heard them locking the dining hall."  <P>
"Perhaps he didn't lock his door?"  <P>"I don't think
so." Alice tilted her head. "He had the only room with a lockable
door by his request, and he had bodyguards too. Would someone like
that really not lock the door?"  <P>"This is just
speculation. What we need are facts," Junho said.  <P>
"How about we ask the staff some questions?" Mizael said.  <P> <P> Alice had a mischievous smile on her face. "I've got an
idea. We can eavesdrop on the police when they're questioning the
staff." <P>
"Are you going to use one of those weird tigerborn
magic spells?" Mizael asked.  <P>Junho looked at Mizael
askew.  <P>Alice shrugged. "I'm not very good at magic,
so nothing that fancy. We've got an attic, and we can hear
everything that goes on in the inn from there."  <P>They
gathered in the dusty attic, their faces close to the floor. Many
voices were scattered throughout the inn. Alice listened for the
officers.  <P>"Where were you yesterday night?" an
officer asked.  <P>"I went to visit my father's grave,"
Kyuhan said.  <P>"Did you see any dwarves around here as
you headed out?" <P>"No." <P>"Think
carefully. It doesn't have to be a state official or anything. Any
dwarves at all?"  <P>Mizael whispered, "I know what's
going on here."  <P>"They seem eager to pin this on a
dwarf," Junho said.  <P>"The Dwalvic Union is Makuran's
enemy. They want a justification for action. I don't like the
dwarves as much as the next guy, but this is just a sham. They're
not interested in who actually did it."  <P>"Let's keep
listening," Alice said. "Even if they have an agenda, we might be
able to find something out."  <P>"Do you know if his door
was locked last night?" an officer asked.  <P>"I don't
know. I wasn't here."  <P>Later, a high-pitched voice
came into the room. "Am I in trouble?" Yuna asked.  <P>"No. Just answer our questions. You were the staff in charge of
serving Minister McLazarus. When was the last time you saw him
alive?" <P>"Eleven-ten maybe?" <P>"Do you
know for sure?"  <P>"I think so." Her voice was small. "I
looked at the clock before I came to his room."  <P>"What
was he doing?"  <P>"He was drunk, so his guards were
carrying him to his room."  <P>Alice said, "They're being
more thorough than I expected."  <P>"Even if they want to
blame the Dwalvic Union, they at least need a compelling case.
They'll probably just blow up any link they find at the end," Junho
said.  <P>"Did he lock the door?" an officer asked.  <P> <P> "I heard the door lock," Yuna said.  <P>"Did he
say anything to you or his bodyguards?"  <P>"No. I asked
him if he needed anything, and he didn't say anything."  <P>
 "Was this before or after he locked the door?"  <P>
"Before. The men put him in bed and closed the door. I asked if he
needed anything, and he didn't reply. He just locked the door, so I
thought he didn't need me."  <P>They spent the rest of
the interview trying to grab straws at any link to the dwarves. Nina
was questioned next.  <P>"I hope I can be of some help to
you, but I didn't see much of McLazarus around," Nina said.  <P> <P> "Just tell us what you can. All the times you saw the
Minister."  <P>"I saw him once as he was first walking to
his room. And once later when he was going to meet the Count."  <P> <P> "Did you notice anything unusual?"  <P>"No, his
guards were with him every time I saw him." <P>The
rest of the interviews yielded no useful information, at least as
far as Alice could make out. Even her father's account was
predictable. They had discussed political matters and made small talk,
and the Minister had too much to drink and was half-asleep as his
guards carried him to his room.  <P>"Even my father
doesn't know anything." Alice sighed.  <P>"It makes
sense. The Count is on good terms with the Minister. He's the least
likely to have any knowledge of a plot to kill him," Junho said. <P>Mizael looked at them curiously. <P>"What
is it?" Alice asked.  <P>"You two are siblings, right?" <P>
"Maybe
it's just a cultural difference, but I just wanted to know why you
call him your father, but Junho calls him the Count. Sorry, it's
off topic,
but it was bugging me," Mizael said.  <P>Alice
looked down. "Ah, that&#133;" She was sure it was a painful memory, or
lack thereof.  <P>"Did I ask something I shouldn't have?" <P>
"No, it's okay," Junho said. "It's not a secret. I'm
an adopted son. I was part of the An clan."  <P>"I feel
like I've heard of that name."  <P>"They were one of the
noble clans that took part in the February 1st movement in 1919. The
protest against the Solradian occupation. There was a crackdown in
the years after that, and when I was young, they dissolved the clan
by arresting or executing most of them, including my parents. I was
only five, so I don't even remember their faces. Then Alice's family
adopted me. That was fourteen years ago," Junho said.  <P>
"I'm sorry to hear that," Mizael said.  <P>"That's
ancient history though. Let's take a look at the room."  <P> <P> Alice wondered whether it was worse to remember such a
tragedy, or to have knowledge of it but have lost one's memory of it.
Either way, if it was ancient history, Junho was still living in it, and
Alice couldn't say anything to him; she had no right to. Her family had
collaborated with the Solradians, building an inn for occupation
officials in exchange for subsidies. No matter how much she loved her
older brother, her words would only sound hollow to him.  <P>
They stood in front of the room where the Minister had lain, his body
now gone. The pool of blood had disappeared too.  <P> "The
police really cleaned this place up. Not a trace of my father." Mizael
looked at the doorknob. "Is there any way to pick this lock?"  <P>"No, there's only one way to open it from
the outside if it's locked," Junho said. "You have to draw a special
magitech pattern on the knob. The only two who know the pattern are
Nina and the Count." He stepped inside the room and turned the lock.
"The only way to lock it is from the inside."  <P>"What
about magic?" Mizael asked.  <P>"Mizael, there's no magic
that convenient. Radiaurora is importing magitech from Ilysveil and
Makuran. If there were any magic that could just open a simple lock
from outside without damaging it, you would know before us," Alice
said. <P>"The window?" <P>Junho walked up to
the one window in the room. He felt the hinges on the left and
right. He looked at the glowing sphere attached to the center of the
two window panes. "The hinges are fine. The locking talisman is
fully functional too. This window can be closed from the outside,
but it only opens from the inside."  <P>"Secret
passageways?"  <P>"None that I'm aware of, and I've lived
here for years. And the bodyguards inspected every corner for stuff
like that."  <P>Mizael sat on the floor. "This doesn't
make any sense. The only way into the room is through the door. The
door was locked from the inside, and it wasn't tampered with. My
father locks the door at eleven-ten, and he's just dead in the room
in the morning?"  <P>Alice twirled a lock of hair between
her fingers. "A few things are out of place."  <P>"You
have some ideas?" Mizael asked.  <P>She smiled. Alice had
never imagined she might be helpful to Mizael like this. It wasn't
right to be happy in a situation like this, but she couldn't help
it. "It might be nothing, but it's worth checking out. Yuna just
started the other day, so why was she put in charge of an important
guest like the Minister? Wouldn't a veteran normally be assigned for
such a guest? Who was in charge of the assignments?"  <P>
"That would be Nina, since she's the chief maid," Junho said.  <P> <P> "We should talk to her. It's not like I suspect her or
anything, though," Alice said. She wasn't sure whether she had said that
to justify her course of action to them or to herself.  <P>
They caught Nina hanging clothes on the drying line behind the inn. Yuna
handed her a blanket from the basket, and Nina hung it up on
clothespins.  <P>"We would like a word with you,
Nina," Alice said.  <P>"Yes, of course, young lady," Nina
said. "How can I help you?" Her wrinkly smile was gentle.  <P> <P> Alice felt guilty about asking these questions but
pressed forward. She chose her words carefully. "Why did Yuna get
assigned to the Minister? I know it wasn't her fault, but she had a lot
of responsibility from day one, and the way things turned out, it must
be weighing on her."  <P>Yuna hid behind Nina and grabbed
onto her robes. Nina stroked Yuna on the head and sighed. "This
child has had a hard life. Her father died in the war. He was one of
the conscripts in a factory in Hirosaki when the void bomb hit." <P>
Misery loved company. The suffering of war always
spread beyond its immediate victims. "What about her mother?" Alice
asked.  <P>"The provisional government needed some women
to&#133; earn some money for the country through any means. I've heard
the odds of her coming back home are slim." <P>"What does
that have to do with her assignment though?" Mizael asked.  <P> <P> Nina looked at Mizael. "As you can imagine, the Count was
hesitant about hiring a twelve year-old. I told him I would take
responsibility if he gave her a chance to prove herself by serving
McLazarus satisfactorily. I know it must hurt to lose your father, but
please don't be angry with her."  <P>"Can we just ask
her a few questions?" Junho said.  <P>"Are you up for it,
Yuna?" Nina asked.  <P>Yuna nodded. "I want to be
helpful."  <P>"When were all the times you saw the
Minister?" Junho asked.  <P>"I saw him when he arrived.
Later, I brought him some coffee. The Count told me Minister
McLazarus prefers coffee to tea. He left to go to the bathroom for a
bit after that. He went out to meet the Count at night, and he came
back drunk. I checked up on him a bit after he came back, but he
didn't answer me and just locked the door."  <P>Junho
patted her on the head. "That's all. Thanks for helping us out." <P>
"Let's talk to S&#249;khua," Alice said. "The last thing
the Minister did was talk with my father, and S&#249;khua's my father's
personal butler. Maybe he noticed something."  <P>They
ran into Kyuhan carrying a tray of beef bone broth and pickled
cabbage. "Hello young lady and young master."  <P>
"Welcome back, Kyuhan," Junho said.  <P>"It's good to be
back, though I heard about what happened," he said.  <P>
"It's not your responsibility," Alice said.  <P>"Yeah,
don't worry about it." Mizael looked somewhat down as he said it,
though. "That looks good. What is it?"  <P>"S&#249;lr&#249;ngtang
and gimchi. I don't think you would like it though. Westerners think
the gimchi smells bad."  <P>"I think my father would have
liked it. He didn't care about the smell of foods, only the taste." <P>
Kyuhan patted him on the back. "My old man had bad
breath too. I still loved him. It's hard, but you've got a long life
ahead of you. I've got to get this delivered." He walked down the
hall and around the corner.  <P>They filed into the main
staff room and found S&#249;khua boiling tea. Aside from the smell of
cleaning solution, a soft scent of green tea and herbs floated
throughout the room. He looked up as they entered.  <P>
"How may I help you?"  <P>"We were looking into the
Minister's death for Mizael here. You were one of the last ones to
see him alive, during the meeting with my father. Did you notice
anything strange?" Alice asked.  <P>"Unfortunately not. I
told the police. The lord was talking about acquiring a
construction company to build more branches. The Minister was
talking about offering him a contract to build some part of a new
military base. Other than that kind of standard political talk, they
made some small talk."  <P>"Everything was normal up
until he was murdered&#133;" Junho said.  <P>"No, that's	wrong. It wasn't," Alice said, looking back up. <P>"What
do you mean?" Mizael asked. "Was there something wrong about that
conversation?"  <P>"No, not the conversation itself. But
things weren't normal before the meeting either. The Minister came
here at five, and he was supposed to meet my father soon, but he
didn't meet him until nine-thirty. Why?"  <P>"Ah, that."
S&#249;khua took the steaming kettle off the stove as it screeched. "All
of the staff were in a meeting with the lord, well, except Yuna and
Nina."  <P>"It wasn't scheduled. What was this all
about?" Junho asked.  <P>"Many of the staff wanted the
lord to support the People's Legion. They begged and pleaded for a
while."  <P>"The Linkists?" Mizael cried. "Did the
Dwalvic Union actually have something to do with this?"  <P>S&#249;khua shook
his head. "No, no. I don't think it was
anything of the sort. I didn't see any dwarves with them nor did they
mention any alliance with the Dwalvic Union. They said the people had
suffered under the old Radiauroran dynasty, and again under Solradian
occupation. They asked the lord to cut ties with Makuran and support
equality."  <P>"What did he say?" Alice
asked. She had heard of the Linkists. She didn't fully understand
them, but she got the sense that the turmoil in this land had not
subsided.  <P>"He refused. For better or for worse, he
chose to collaborate with Solradia and now Makuran. He believes he
protected Radiaurorans by making a place for them."  <P>
"What's going to happen now?"  <P>"We may lose some
employees, I'm afraid."  <P>"One more thing. When did the
meeting with my father end?"  <P>"Ten fifty-five."  <P>"Thank you." She didn't want to lose
anything, yet the
world around her was tearing at its own throat. Alice had already
had a premonition that something terrible had happened right under
her nose, but now the pieces all fit together. "Mizael, Junho, I
have an idea."  <P><p class=drop>They sat in her room once again. <P>"You have that look on your face that says you know
something," Junho said.  <P>"I'm not completely sure, but
I think I figured it out," Alice said.  <P>"Tell us,"
Mizael said.  <P>"I don't know if I want to believe it
myself, though." <P>"It's <i>my</i> father. I'm ready for the
truth, no matter what it is, so there's no reason for <i>you</i> to be
afraid."  <P>There was, but she had to say it. "Kyuhan
killed your father."  <P>"What? He was the one person who
couldn't have done it. He was at his father's grave," Junho said. <P>
"I know. That's why he was the perfect person to do
it. No one would suspect him. And he wasn't alone. He did the
killing part alone, but others set up the situation."  <P>
"A completely locked room. That means Nina had to have opened the
door for Kyuhan since I doubt it was your father," Mizael said.  <P>
 "No, that would be too obvious. I'll go through
everything in chronological order. The Minister arrived here at five.
The guards inspected the room for any secret passageways and such. Yuna
greeted him. A bit later, Kyuhan leaves the inn for his father's grave.
Instead of the meeting with the Count happening as planned, the staff
are all protesting in my father's room. Yuna gives the Minister the
coffee during this time and later he goes to the bathroom before he goes
to meet my father at nine-thirty. The Minister gets drunk by the end of
the meeting, and he returns shortly after ten fifty-five. Yuna sees him
but doesn't do anything until eleven-ten when she knocks on his door.
The door is locked and no one says anything. The next morning, Yuna is
worried that the Minister is not answering the door, so Nina unlocks it,
and here we are."  <P>"Right. Those are the basic facts. He had to
have been killed between eleven-ten and the morning," Mizael said. <P>
"No. He was already dead by eleven-ten," Alice said. <P>
"But he locked the door, so he must've been alive." <P>
"How do we know that was him, though? He didn't say
anything. I think it was the killer who locked the door."  <P> <P> "How did the killer get in though? His guards would've
heard someone trying to enter."  <P>Junho gasped. "No, there
was one time he could've gotten in. The door can only be locked from
the inside."  <P>Alice nodded. "So when he went to the
bathroom, and his guards were with him the whole time, the room was
unlocked."  <P>"But all the staff were accounted for
except for Yuna and Nina, and they couldn't have hid in the room the
whole time. People would question where they went," Mizael said. <P>
"All except one. Kyuhan was not supposed to be here,
so no one would question that he's not present. He's the only one
who could've snuck back into the inn and hid in the Minister's room
without raising suspicion. Perhaps in the closet or under the bed." <P>
"This feels like a stretch," Mizael said.  <P> <P> "If you want a smoking gun, there is one. Kyuhan was
supposed to have left right after the Minister came. Kyuhan said that
his father had bad breath <i>too</i>. You only said that he didn't mind
smelly
foods, not that he didn't take care of his breath. I didn't notice
anything unusual about his breath either. But if he came back drunk, his
breath would have stunk of alcohol. There was no way Kyuhan could have
known that if he wasn't with your father after the meeting," Alice said. <P>
"That bastard. Tell your head maid to
suspend him right now so we can get the police." Mizael stood up,
but Alice grabbed him by the sleeve.  <P>"No, we can't
tell Nina. There's more."  <P>Mizael sat back down. Junho
looked away. It seemed he understood where this was going.  <P> <P> "There's the question of why didn't Nina just assign
herself as his service staff and just go in and out late at night since
she could unlock the door? That's exactly why she didn't. Suspicion
would fall on her immediately. That brings us to Yuna. I wondered why
Nina chose her. I do believe her story about her parents. But that's why
she's perfect for her role. A kid with that much to lose is the least
suspicious. The plan relied on the Minister going to the bathroom at the
right time. There was no way to guarantee that unless he was poisoned
with something nonlethal. If it was lethal, then the staff would be
easily suspected. Yuna served him coffee, but where did that coffee come
from? Coffee is very fragrant, but when we went to the stove, there was
only the smell of tea. Nina must've given her the coffee from somewhere
else."  <P>"There's no way to know when he's going to go
the bathroom though," Mizael said.  <P>"There isn't."
Alice buried her face in her hands. It felt as though the whole
world turned its back on her. "It was weird that the staff tied up
my father for a whole three and a half hours with their pleas. They
had to be stalling for time so Kyuhan could slip in after the
Minister went to the bathroom. Everyone was in on it."  <P> <P> "Why? Why is everyone so determined to kill my father?" <P>
 Alice couldn't answer that.  <P>"1919." Junho
looked at Alice, and then at Mizael. "Kyuhan said this was the
thirtieth anniversary of his father's death. It's 1949 right now. A
lot of patriots died in 1919. Yuna had her father ripped away from
her by the Solradians, and the Makuranians sent him to his grave. The
provisional government collaborating with the Makuranians took away
her mother. From their perspective, the Makuranians are just the
Solradians all over again. The Count is a collaborator, and the
Minister the occupier."  <P>"I can't just let this go,
even if the culprit is everyone," Mizael said.  <P>"I
don't want to lose everyone, but this is a murder. There might be
nothing I can do," Alice said.  <P>"These people aren't
evil. They're patriots that have been through a lot, and they're
still fighting for Radiaurora," Junho said.  <P>Her big
brother was right next to her, yet he felt so far away. Everyone
did. "I just wanted everyone to be happy."  <P>"There's
no way to make everyone happy," S&#249;khua said, leaning against the
doorway. "Sorry
for eavesdropping. I was curious about the case myself, and it
seemed you three knew something."  <P>"Did you come here
just out of curiosity?" Mizael asked.  <P>"No. I said
there's no happiness for everyone. But there is a way to make
everyone equally unhappy."  <P>"Anything," Alice said. <P>
"We'll tell the police about the main participants.
Nina, Yuna, and Kyuhan, but we'll give them advance warning so they
can run."  <P>"But what about the rest of the staff? The
explanation will have holes without their involvement," Junho said. <P>
"That's why this will make everyone unhappy. One
person needs to be a scapegoat. Someone who was the ringleader of
this People's Legion protest. The staff were just unwitting
participants in the murder plan. This person, if caught, unlike the
others who will go to jail, will likely have a public execution." <P>
The room went silent. Even if they had killed the
Minister, a public execution was too much.  <P>"I'll do
it," Junho said.  <P>"Junho!" Alice cried. "What are you
thinking?" She grabbed his sleeve as he stood up.  <P>"My
family died fighting for independence, and I grew up spoiled by a
collaborator's family. I love you, Alice, but it's time I fulfill my
duties as head of the An clan. I'm going to fight. To protect
everyone. I can't let anyone else die fighting an occupation."  <P> <P> "Pack your bags, then," S&#249;khua said.  <P>"You
know I can't accept this," Mizael said.  <P>"I won't ask
you to. There is no justice here. If you won't do it for the people
here, at least do it for Alice. Just let it go this once. You can do
whatever you want afterward," Junho said. <P>"I'm going to hunt all
of you down. You know that, right?" Mizael said. <P>"Yes."  <P>"You'll be executed." <P>"I've made my peace," Junho
said. He left with S&#249;khua.  <P>Mizael kicked the wall and
screamed.  <P>Next morning, Alice awoke with tears in her
eyes. No, it hadn't been a dream. She had lost Mizael's friendship,
Nina who had been like a grandmother to her, Kyuhan who had served
her since she was little, and even her beloved older brother, all in
the span of a day. She got up and looked out the window. A brilliant
dawn was rising from the horizon.  <P><i>Big brother, are
you seeing the same dawn I am?</i>
