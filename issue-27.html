    </header>

    
    <p>Some stories wear their inspiration on their sleeve, and the title of Kyle E. Miller&#39;s wonderlandish excursion through a decaying plane pays clear homage to the Harlan Ellison classic, &#34;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&#34;. Prepare yourselves for a similarly rich, strange journey, but there the similarities very definitely end...</p>

    <p>You&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking where you left it, or so the unhelpfully wise would tell you, forgetting (or ignoring) that this doesn&#39;t account for interference from any bad actors out there. Gabrielle Bleu shows that what you might instead need could still be nearby, and yesterday&#39;s enemy could be today&#39;s friend.</p>

    <p>Life Isn&#39;t Fair - the formative lesson of childhood, preparing us for the painful reality we&#39;re going to have to grow up and live with for seventy years or more, if we&#39;re lucky. But while you&#39;re learning to accept it, Hannah Hulbert suggests you consider: If life isn&#39;t fair, could it be that unlife is?</p>

    <p>Ghost stories and romance — what could be a more perfect match? Oh course, there&#39;s inevitably the risk of tragedy with such a pairing, but Daniel Rabuzzi gives us reason to hold out hope that love really can conquer all… even across centuries.</p>

    <p>Social Media - some love it, some hate it, but there is certainly a rich vein to mine in how the contemporary digital landscape will evolve in the future. Paul Alex Gray strikes more than just crypto-currency with this tale of a pre-apocalyptic soldier-for-hire who has to deal with a whole lot worse than online trolls.</p>

    <p>Here we have the first of two substantial sci-fi pieces with a focus on family, one in which overcoming separation is at the heart of things, the other with gaining independence as the goal - both presenting futures of interplanetary colonisation. Jalyn Renae Fiske takes us very far from home and, against all circumstance, shows that there could be a home there too.</p>

    <p>Depression is a kind of war. Oppression is as well. When you find yourself living through intolerable times, just surviving can be a small act of defiance, or even rebellion. But as Katie McIvor&#39;s story underlines, there may still come a point at which survival-rebellion isn&#39;t enough.</p>

    </header>

    
    <p>Closing out this issue is our second long sci-fi read, and as previously hinted at, they serve as inverted reflections of each other. In Claire Scherzinger&#39;s tale, we focus on a daughter seeking escape rather than a father desperately searching, and while the previous story swiftly departed from a technological environment for a more primitive one, this time it&#39;s a seemingly simple way of life being abandoned for an infinitely wider world.</p>
