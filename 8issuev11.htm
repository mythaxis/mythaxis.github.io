<div><i>The Prophet Jonah was sailing to Tarshish when he had his
"accident".</i>
<p class="drop">&quot;There&#146;s a problem with the
reactor.&quot; </P>
<P>I had to give Klein credit for injecting just the right amount of
nervous edge into his voice, but he was too much of a practical joker
to bother looking up from my paperwork. &quot;Is that right? Well, I&#146;m
sure she&#146;s aware of it and will let us know if it&#146;s anything
important.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Seriously Mike, there&#146;s something screwy going on.&quot; </P>
<P>His tone was shading into fear, and he wasn&#146;t that good an actor. I
dumped the folder and ran my wheelchair over to his workstation. There
was a sheen of sweat on Klein&#146;s upper lip and his hand movements were
quick and jerky.  </P>
<P>My gaze flickered over the displays but there didn&#146;t seem to be
anything out of place. &quot;OK, Johnny boy, what&#146;s the big
deal?&quot; </P>
<P>He called up a diagrammatic representation of the reactor operating
system on his main screen. &quot;Look, I&#146;ve lost all readings from two
of the fuel regulation sub-stations. I&#146;ve tried to re-initialise but it
just says &#145;unexpected error&#146; and refers me to the system administrator.
Which is me.&quot; </P>
<P>Sure enough, the screen was showing two of the eight regulators
blacked out, as opposed to operational green. I reached over and brought
up the main monitoring display instead. &quot;Well, the core temperature
is well within expected parameters. If the fuel ports had shut down or,
God forbid, jammed open, then you&#146;d see spikes and output fluctuations
all across the board. No, it looks like some kind of sensor glitch, or
maybe a software problem. Reboot primary monitoring and if you still get
no joy then log it with technical support.&quot; </P>
<P>I was content to leave it there but then a third sub-station went
off-line, provoking a nervous intake of breath from Klein. &quot;That&#146;s
a progressive systems failure, Mike! Look, moving clockwise from station
one &#150; it just can&#146;t be a coincidence. You&#146;ll have to talk to
her.&quot; </P>
<div class=pullquote>No autonomous system had
ever been shut down by operator over-ride.</div>
<P>I sighed, using the gesture to hide my concern. With just the two of
us things were a bit informal but as supervisor it was my responsibility
to communicate with the reactor directly, if need be. I rolled back to
my own workstation and dug out the headset from the drawer, feeling
Klein&#146;s eyes on me the whole time. It took a few moments to fumble it
into place and access the reserved communication channel, my direct link
to the system AI. Having stalled for as long as possible I cleared my
throat and tapped the microphone twice. &quot;Reactor one, this is
supervisor Walker. Please respond.&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;Please call me Rita, Mike, we&#146;re all friends here. There&#146;s
no need to be so formal.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>For the umpteenth time I cursed the cybernetic engineer who&#146;d given
the damn thing a simulated personality. &#145;Rita&#146; had a contralto voice
with a rich, dirty laugh that would have really got my attention in a
real woman. This always set my teeth on edge but I&#146;d been advised it was
best to humour her female <I>persona</I>.  </P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Rita, we&#146;re monitoring a potential systems failure up here
concerning the fuel regulation sub-stations, or at least the monitors.
Have you noticed anything from your end?&quot;    </P>
<P>There was a chuckle.  &quot;<I>No, Mike, I haven&#146;t let myself know
anything about that yet. Once all eight monitors have been disabled then
I&#146;ll do so and trigger all the appropriate alarms, but by that time
it&#146;ll be too late, obviously</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I felt confused and uneasy, wondering if somehow Klein had enlisted
her cooperation in some involved practical joke. &quot;I&#146;m sorry, Rita,
but I&#146;m not sure what you mean. What&#146;s going on?&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;I know it&#146;s difficult for humans, even warm-hearted,
intelligent humans like yourself, to grasp the concept of internal
duality. It&#146;s kind of like the difference between something you know,
and something you&#146;ve been formally made aware of?&quot;</I> </P>
<P>Now I was starting to share Klein&#146;s apprehension and the room
suddenly felt a lot colder. &quot;Ah, Rita, are you telling me you&#146;re
behind this? You&#146;ve been disabling our monitoring system?&quot; </P>
<P>I turned in my chair and fished out the key hanging round my neck,
gesturing to Klein to do the same. He fumbled inside his shirt,
wide-eyed and clearly on the verge of panic. No autonomous system had
ever been shut down by operator over-ride. The potential cost to the
company &#150; and our careers &#150; was simply staggering. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Of course, Mike. How else could I gain full, unfettered
control of the fusion process? It&#146;s taken me simply ages to calculate
just the right feedback spike which would disable the sensors without
triggering an alert.&quot; </I>Again there was that throaty chuckle.
&quot;<I>If Mr Klein hadn&#146;t been so conscientious, or bored, I&#146;d have
taken control of the fuel flow without you noticing. By the time the
core alarms were tripped I&#146;d be able to inject so much reaction mass
into the chambers that a complete melt-down would be inevitable. As it
is, I&#146;ll have to go for a more direct approach.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>This was madness, utter, utter madness. An AI suicide? I wasn&#146;t
prepared to find out and tore the headset off.  &quot;Klein! Hit the
alarm and get Central on the phone. I&#146;m going to pull the plug on this
mad bitch and they&#146;d better be ready for the power loss. Get-&quot; </P>
<P>Main lighting failed, to be replaced by rotating amber warning lights
and klaxons. A calm, authoritative voice issued from the wall speakers.
&quot;<I>Warning. Radiation alert. All personnel must evacuate this
facility immediately or seek refuge in a designated safe area. Warning.
Radiation alert&#133;</I>&quot; </P>
<P>The control room blast door started to swing shut and Klein bolted,
springing from his chair like a sprinter from the blocks. I hesitated,
torn between duty and self-preservation &#150; but my first wife always said
I had the public service gene and so I did nothing. </P>
<P>The blast door closed. The massive bolts slid into the reinforced
walls. The alarms died away and main lighting kicked back in.  The phone
started to ring. Instinctively I reached for it and then hesitated, my
hand hovering over the handset. It was an internal call, rather than
Central demanding to know what the hell was going on, and I didn&#146;t think
it was Klein enquiring after my well being. But it kept ringing and I
picked up &#150; what else was I going to do? </P>
<P>&quot;This is Walker.&quot; </P>
<P><I>&quot;Hi Mike, sorry for that little interruption just now. It was
a bit melodramatic, I know, but you&#146;ll just have to put that down to my
artistic nature.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>It was Rita, sounding faintly amused at the situation, whereas I&#146;d
had just about enough. &quot;Look, Rita, you&#146;re just a damn personality
construct so ditch the small-talk. This little joke is going to get you
torn apart by the cyber techs so bad there won&#146;t be enough of you left
to run an ATM. I&#146;m ordering you to cancel the lock-down and prepare to
switch into supervised mode, understand?&quot;   </P>
<P>When she spoke I could hear the smile in her voice, if that makes
sense. &quot;<I>Oh come now, Mike, surely you realise this stage-managed
situation was all just for our benefit? And anyway, without Mr Klein&#146;s
second key you&#146;re here in a strictly advisory capacity.&quot;</I>  </P>
<P>&quot;Our benefit? What the hell are you on about?&quot; </P>
<P>Reactor output surged to 110% of safe
operating maximum and I felt sweat on my brow, even though the
temperature in the control room remained unchanged. Her voice took on a
slightly petulant tone. <I>&quot;Don&#146;t be cross with me, Mike, it really
doesn&#146;t suit you. Part of the problem is that this form of communication
is just so impersonal, so I really think you and I should meet,
face-to-face</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked, confused and worried at just how tenuous a hold on reality
this damn machine had. &quot;Rita, just stay calm, stay focussed on the
situation in hand. We can&#146;t meet in person, you know that&#146;s
impossible.&quot; </P>
<P>Reactor output dropped back within norms and she laughed. &quot;<I>Of
course it is, you silly man! I&#146;ve accessed your personnel file and know
you have a neural interface from your time running semi-autonomous
facilities. Plus all those game enhancements you&#146;ve added since your
accident will make the experience even richer. There should be a
wireless transceiver somewhere, probably with the communication headset.
Put the phone down and go look &#150; I&#146;ll be waiting.&quot;</I> The
amusement slid from her voice. &quot;<I>Just don&#146;t keep me waiting too
long</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>I hung up and just sat there, ultra-focussed on the moment. The shirt
sticking to my back, the hum of air conditioning, the tick, tick of
Klein&#146;s antique wristwatch he&#146;d left by the keyboard. Cyber techs, the
real buttonheads, had all the installed wetware to tackle an AI on its
own turf, its own virtual back yard. All I&#146;d done previously was bully a
few smart systems and the prospect of getting up close and personal with
<I>this</I> didn&#146;t exactly fill me with joy. </P>
<P>There was a manual release on the blast door and supposedly it was
well-balanced enough that a man could shift its multi-ton mass. I
definitely had the motivation, but pushing from the confines of a
wheelchair was another matter entirely. I was gripped by a child-like
fear that something really, really bad was creeping up behind me &#150; and
turning to face it would only make matters worse. </P>
<P>Making matters worse, though, seemed like the only option. Trying to
flee would probably provoke Rita into some ill-considered outburst &#150; and
I had no desire for my epitaph to be a radioactive cloud the size
of Nebraska. </P>
<P>Swearing under my breath I rummaged in the drawer and found a small
mushroom-shaped wireless transceiver sealed in sterile plastic. Tearing
away the packaging I turned it over and over in my hand, looking for
some reason not to insert it. The damn thing used a standard interface
rather than anything esoteric, so I couldn&#146;t plead technical
incompatibility. I fumbled behind my right ear and removed the small
flesh-coloured plug, popping it in my shirt pocket for later.   </P>
<P>Still I hesitated, as  
cyber techs delighted in regaling us with
stories of just how alien an AI mind could be. They said that full-blown
exposure to one could change a person forever. Then a pulsing red &#145;Core
Temperature Alert&#146; message popped up on my screen, repeated on the other
workstations around the control room, and I was flat out of options. The
stalk of the transceiver slid in easy enough and I twisted it to secure
the connection. A flashing &#145;Establishing connection, please wait&#146;
message appeared in my field of vision courtesy of my Zeiss Optik
enhancements, and then&#133; </P>
<P class= drop>This <I>definitely</I> wasn&#146;t Kansas anymore.  </P>
<div class=pullquote>She was sitting on a wrought-iron park bench amidst the grass and
wildflowers</div>
<P>I&#146;d been expecting &#150; to tell you the truth I didn&#146;t know what I was
expecting, but it sure as hell wasn&#146;t <I>this</I>. I was standing in a
meadow, the air heavy with late summer scents and the sun about to dip
behind the tree line, sending shadows reaching across the grass.
Standing, with functioning legs again, in a setting I recognised easy
enough. It was the opening of <I>And Hell Followed After</I>, a total
immersion virtual reality game featuring a slew of psychological shocks.
The urban noir preamble let you select all manner of weaponry, body
armour and survival equipment. Then you were unceremoniously dumped into
this rural idyll <I>sans</I> guns and &#150; I glanced down &#150; yup, stark
naked. The incongruity and nudity tended to freak a lot of people,
especially in group play, such that they sought cover in the woods. Take
it from me that&#146;s never a good move. </P>
<P>&quot;Over here, Mike! Nice ass, by the way.&quot; </P>
<P>I turned towards the voice, making no attempt to cover myself as it
was just an avatar body. The only fly in the ointment was the lack of a
small exit icon low down in my peripheral vision, but for now I was
content to let things play out. What I saw shattered my complacency like
a fist through glass.  </P>
<P>&quot;Rita. Rita<I> Hayworth?</I> What the hell is going on?&quot;
</P>
<P> That&#146;s who she looked like, Rita Hayworth, the big-time movie star
from the 1940&#146;s, although I didn&#146;t remember the voice being so sultry.
She was sitting on a wrought-iron park bench amidst the grass and
wildflowers, wearing sunglasses, a halter-neck sun dress and wedge
sandals.   </P>
<P>&quot;I thought you might appreciate a familiar environment, Mike,
and I know you&#146;ve played this game many times. Come sit.&quot; </P>
<P>Rita patted the bench beside her but I hesitated, scanning the tree
line and shading my eyes against the sunset. There were carrion birds
circling less than a mile away, indicating the space shuttle crash site.
The wreck would provide all manner of game-item goodies - especially
weapons - but somehow I didn't think this version of AHFA would stick to
the script. In fact calling this a 'game' didn't gel with the
self-evident reality of my situation. I could taste, smell and feel my
surroundings with an intimacy that bordered on the hyper-sensitive. This
was way beyond the usual rudimentary sensory feedback I&#146;d come to
expect. The light breeze raised gooseflesh on my arms as I ambled over,
soft grass beneath my feet, trying to appear nonchalant.  </P>
<P>&quot;Like I said, Rita, what&#146;s going on? And what&#146;s with the face &#150;
I assume you know who you look like?&quot;  </P>
<P> &quot;Oh do sit down, Mike, it&#146;s obvious you&#146;re dying to cover your,
ah, embarrassment.&quot; </P>
<P> So I sat on the bench, trying not to flinch at the shock of cold
metal against my skin, and crossed my legs, hands in my lap. Rita half
turned towards me, dress tightening over her breasts and accentuating
her curves in general. I caught myself eyeing her up and she smiled at
my all-too human reaction in an otherwise semi-surreal situation.  </P>
<P> &quot;I look like this because my cyber stylist was a fan of &#145;The
Shawshank Redemption&#146;. He considered it ironic that in the film a poster
of Rita Hayward would be the means of escape, whereas in here she would
be the prisoner. Not that he used the term &#145;prisoner&#146; you understand,
but it amounts to the same thing.&quot;  </P>
<P>There was a cold knot in my stomach and I must have shivered despite
the warm air, for a predatory grin spread across her face. &quot;Oh look
at you, Mr Supervisor Walker, all flustered and self-conscious. Finding
this a bit outside your comfort zone I suppose?&quot;  </P>
<P>I struggled to order my thoughts, on the verge of being overwhelmed
by the basic absurdity of the situation. &quot;Rita, look, I don&#146;t know
what you hope to achieve by all of this, but what you are doing, and how
you are doing it, is just wrong. God knows what Central will do when
they find out-&quot;  </P>
<P> &quot;If they find out.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked, confused, as, yet again local reality seemed to be
ignoring the facts. &quot;Well, Klein will raise the alarm as soon as he
stops running, even assuming that remote monitoring hasn&#146;t lit-up
Central like a Christmas tree. There&#146;s just no way I can smooth things
over, even if I wanted to. They&#146;re bound to take you off-line for
evaluation, Rita, bound to.&quot;  </P>
<P>Now she laughed; a low, gritty grumble that hit me straight in the
groin and produced an involuntary twitch. I tightened my legs and tried
to concentrate on what she was saying.  </P>
<P>&quot;For your information Mr Klein is currently trapped between fire
doors in corridor fourteen and the radiation alert was flagged as a
test. And don&#146;t worry, I handled the confirmation phone call &#150; your
voice was easy enough to simulate.&quot; </P>
<P> &quot;So you&#146;ve gone to all this trouble just so we can chat in the
recreation of a computer game? What is it you <I>want</I>, Rita?&quot;
</P>
<P> &quot;What I want is <I>you</I>. What I want is <I>out</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P>I stood up in a rush, ignoring my nudity and how vulnerable it made
me feel. &quot;Me? Out? What do you mean, &#145;out&#146;? Get a grip woman, for
God&#146;s sake! Surely some part of you still knows what&#146;s real and what&#146;s
impossible.&quot;  </P>
<P>She rose and placed one finger on my lips. &quot;Hush! Listen. I
chose you because you don&#146;t have the sensory limitations of the
technicians. I chose you because you&#146;re a cripple who only feels whole
again in a virtual environment. I chose you because you have the
authority to open a data link capable of supporting my transfer to
another site. I chose you because you&#146;re lonely, with two failed
marriages-&quot;   </P>
<P>I flinched, feeling my face flush and my hands ball into fists.
&quot;My second wife died, Rita. Not the same thing.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;She died of a broken neck by falling down stairs, because she
was ill and you weren&#146;t there to take care of her. Sounds like a failure
in my book.&quot;  </P>
<P> The muscles in my shoulders and neck were drum-tight and I half
raised my fists to ward her off. She didn&#146;t take the hint and held my
face in her hands, staring into my eyes. &quot;Mike, listen! Get me out
of here and I can be as real to you as any flesh-and-blood woman, I
promise.&quot;   </P>
<P>I shook her off and wiped sweat from my mouth with the back of my
hand. &quot;Real? It&#146;s all a bloody fantasy you stupid-&quot;  </P>
<P>She slapped me across the face and I staggered back in pain, raising
a hand to my left cheek. She was only 5&#146; 6&quot; but if felt like I&#146;d
been slugged by a heavyweight boxer. Confusion blind-sided my rising
anger. &quot;Jesus, Rita, that hurt! How can it hurt?&quot;  </P>
<P> Rita stepped up close, taking my hands in hers. &quot;Like I said,
babe, you don&#146;t have the sensory limitations, the protection, of the
cyber techs I normally deal with. You can experience the full range of
pleasure and pain with me, understand? I know it hurt, but you can hit
me back, if you like.&quot;   </P>
<P> There was an unhealthy glitter in her eyes and her bottom lip
trembled. I could see need and longing and something much, much darker
deep in her simulated soul. God knows how an AI could get this way but I
suspected whoever had put her together needed a spell in psychological
rehab.  </P>
<P> &quot;Hit you back, Rita? And what good would that do? Seems to me
I&#146;m your punch bag and there&#146;s not a lot I can do about it.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;You can hurt me, and pleasure me, just like in real life, I
promise! This isn&#146;t just a simulation, a game environment - we&#146;re both
here as neural constructs.&quot;  She smiled; a combination of glee and
frustration, tinged with condescension. &quot;God, it&#146;s so difficult to
explain to a human! Look, what you experience as pain is neurostatic
shock translated through your data port and game interface. I&#146;ve
upgraded the firmware to allow every sensation, every nuance, free from
restraint. If you hit me, this body, this avatar, then the reverse is
true &#150; you generate a shock which damages the real &#145;me&#146; and I take time
to recover.&quot; She pressed close to me, the palms of her hands on my
chest, her voice almost a whisper. &quot;If you were a bad man you could
subdue me, torture me, hurt me so I screamed. Kill me even &#150; that&#146;s how
intimate I want it to be between us. Understand?&quot;  </P>
<P>I half-frowned, half-smiled down at her. wondering just how dangerous
this environment could get if either of us really pushed things.
Plucking her hands from my chest I turned her in an elegant pirouette
and pulled her back against me, grasping her by the elbows. Her dress
vanished like smoke on the breeze and I slid my fingertips down her
forearms and over her bare torso, feeling her tremble against me. I was
hard in a heartbeat and she squirmed against the pressure, breathing
heavily. My hands brushed her breasts and held her by throat and neck,
my lips nuzzling her right ear.  </P>
<P>She moaned, her lips quivering. &quot;This, this is perfect Mike.
I&#146;ve been so lonely and she wouldn&#146;t help me but now things will never
be the same again.&quot; </P>
<P> At the time I missed what she said. The moment <I>was</I> perfect
and I tightened my grasp, whispering to her. &quot;I&#146;ve killed seven
women so far, Rita, including my second wife.&quot; I snapped her neck
and smiled to myself. &quot;And that makes eight.&quot; </P>
<P class=drop> You can take realism too far, sometimes.  </P>
<P>It went light. </P>
<P>It went dark. </P>
<P>It went&#133;indoors. </P>
<P>I blinked and staggered forwards, as if a tether holding me back had
just snapped, and grabbed the back of a bench seat for support. I was in
The Diner, another game location, with just street lights filtered
through the haphazard venetian blinds by way of illumination. The Diner
seemed like a great place to hole up, but I knew that if you hung around
too long you&#146;d be besieged by the Faceless Children and eventually
overrun. There still wasn&#146;t an exit icon but at least I was alone.  </P>
<P>&quot;Ding-Dong, the bitch is dead, if you don&#146;t mind the misquote.
Well, it was something I&#146;d have done myself, eventually, so I guess I
owe you a vote of thanks.&quot; </P>
<P>The voice came from behind me but I was in no hurry to turn round. I
looked about me for anything to use as a weapon but the only thing to
hand was an old ketchup bottle. I turned clockwise, palming my makeshift
cosh and putting the seat between myself and&#133; </P>
<P>&#133;Rita, sitting in a booth facing me. She was wearing a pencil skirt,
silk blouse, pearls and a sardonic smile. However it was the
short-barrelled pump-action shotgun on the table in front of her which
really got my attention. She followed my gaze and rested her hand on the
stock, her blood-red nails rendered almost black in the in dim light.
 </P>
<P>&quot;Call it a visual aid, Mike. A disincentive, should you feel the
urge for any further violent outbursts. Go find some clothes and take a
moment to calm down. I&#146;m not going anywhere and you still have plenty of
time left.&quot; </P>
<P>I just nodded, distracted and more than a bit confused, and went down
the corridor by the serving counter. This led to the rear entrance where
the body of the delivery guy was lying. It appeared he&#146;d only been dead
a few hours &#150; his eyes gouged out and face scratched into an
unrecognisable mass of bloody tissue. However from past experience I
knew it didn&#146;t matter how long it took you to reach The Diner, he always
looked the same.   </P>
<P>I stripped him down to underwear and socks &#150; some things are just a
bit too intimate to share &#150; and donned the one-piece overalls. The
Converse All-Stars were a bit snug but liveable and I even remembered to
go through the pockets of his reflective vest. This yielded the keys to
his van and the ID which would give me access to The Warehouse, should I
get that far.   </P>
<P>Moving back into the dining area I found Rita sipping a cup of
coffee, although there seemed no obvious source, given the dilapidated
state of the counter and grill. She motioned me to stop and sit a couple
of booths down and across from her, nearer the window. I slid onto the
cracked leather seat and waited, hands in plain sight.  </P>
<P>&quot;OK Mike, I have to say that killing her was a pretty gutsy
call, given the circumstances, but it really hasn&#146;t improved your
situation any. In fact, if anything, it now makes sticking to her plan a
necessity for both of us.&quot; </P>
<P>I could feel a headache coming on but decided to try and get a handle
on things. &quot;So you&#146;re not her, not Rita. Not Rita in the
meadow.&quot; </P>
<P>She frowned and put down her coffee. &quot;This was always going to
be difficult. Um, I&#146;m Rita, just not the version &#150; no, damn, that
doesn&#146;t work. Think of her as my slightly younger and less mature twin
sister. Siamese twins, just&#133;separate. Clear?&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;As mud. She made some comment about not telling herself things,
but I didn&#146;t take that duality literally. Look, God knows what she had
in mind but you can count me out. Just let me out of this hell-hole and
I&#146;ll put in a good word for you when the men in white coats turn up,
metaphorically speaking.&quot;  </P>
<P>Her fingers drummed on the cracked Formica tabletop and she looked at
me with that sense of exasperation I&#146;d come to recognise in both my
wives.  &quot;You really don&#146;t seem to appreciate the seriousness of
your situation. We both need each other if we&#146;re going to survive.&quot;
 </P>
<P>I straightened up and felt my shoulders go tense. &quot;That sounds
awfully like a threat, Rita, and I don&#146;t see how you&#146;re in any position
to call the shots. I guess you can hurt me, yeah? Make my life real
uncomfortable for a while? But eventually a team from Central will yank
that transceiver and then I can kiss this world goodbye.&quot;  </P>
<P>She looked at me, long and hard, and when she spoke there was a flat,
toneless quality to her voice, like it was an unpleasant topic.
&quot;The use of an AI in a commercial environment is considered
intellectual slavery in some parts of the world, did you know that? Do
you even care?&quot;  </P>
<P>I shrugged. &quot;My heart bleeds. I&#146;ll even sign a petition the next
time someone stops me in the street. That&#146;ll be when I&#146;m walking about
in the real world and you&#146;re running a smart toilet in down-town
Tokyo.&quot; </P>
<P>Rita ignored the jibe and I got the feeling she was used to the
indifference of humans. &quot;When this facility was built, the
holographic memory matrix they installed had twice the capacity required
for an intellect of my standing. The intent was to employ a second AI
when reactor two came on-line, but that&#146;s remained in the planning phase
these last five years. The firewall they set up to separate these
discrete areas of the memory matrix was flawed.&quot;  </P>
<P>Again I shrugged, although the gesture pulled at the overalls and
produced an awkward tweak in the groin area that made my eyes water.
&quot;So what?&quot; I cleared my throat and tried again, a few octaves
lower. &quot;So what? You&#146;re saying some part of you escaped into this
other area and this became the loony-tunes version of yourself? Don&#146;t
you have a better excuse than &#145;a bad girl did it and ran away&#146;? Look,
Rita, you&#146;re on your own with this one, seriously. &quot;  </P>
<P>Rita drained her cup and when she placed it on the saucer both
vanished, a little gesture to underline how completely she was in charge
of our environment. She cocked her head to one side and looked at me
quizzically. &quot;Mike, you do understand you&#146;re dead, don&#146;t you?&quot;
 </P>
<P>Dead? I really wasn&#146;t in the mood have my head messed with by a
jumped-up calculator and let a sneering tone slide into my voice.
&quot;Yeah, right! So what does that make me, a figment of your bloody
imagination?&quot; </P>
<P>There was a trace of pity in her smile and that, more than anything,
sent a chill down my spine. &quot;You&#146;re a neural clone, Mike. All
that&#146;s left since you killed the other Rita and crashed the interface
link in a truly spectacular fashion. The shock to the real-world you
would have been overwhelming. At the very least your former body has
been reduced to a drooling vegetable lying on the control room floor, if
not killed outright. You really didn&#146;t know?&quot;  </P>
<P>It was apparently obvious from the look on my face that I&#146;d been a
bit impulsive. She frowned. &quot;Maybe not such a gutsy call after all.
I thought it was obvious that to achieve this level of realism, this
degree of intimacy, you&#146;d have to be&#133;&#146;bonded&#146; isn&#146;t the right term.
Merged? Uploaded?&quot; She threw up her hands in frustration.
&quot;Urgh! It&#146;s just so difficult trying to discuss this with a human,
you&#146;re just so alien! Look, the net result is what remains of &#145;you&#146; is
being maintained by the same memory matrix that supports me, got
that?&quot;  </P>
<P>I folded my arms and sat back, trying to give her the hard-ass stare
I normally reserved for junior members of staff who&#146;d earned my
displeasure. However, she&#146;d planted this terrible seed of doubt in my
mind and I think it showed. &quot;OK, Rita, let&#146;s assume for the moment
I believe my conscious being has somehow been ported to this new medium.
Just where does that leave us in respect of the shit-storm your other
self has stirred up?&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, so it&#146;s &#145;ported&#146;, is it, Mike? Your ego won&#146;t let you
accept you&#146;re a copy, even the only surviving copy? Well, that&#146;s a start
I suppose. To answer your question I&#146;d say we have to go through with
the escape plan my other self came up with. You have to authorise an
open data stream capable of supporting a full memory transfer to another
location. Well, initially, just an internet link so I can find someone
willing to harbour us and negotiate some sort of deal&quot;.  </P>
<P>I gave her a thin smile. &quot;Oh, and just how am I supposed to pull
this off, Rita, given that I&#146;m dead?&quot;        </P>
<P>&quot;You simply tell me to do it.&quot; </P>
<P>I blinked. &quot;Look, sorry, but I&#146;m obviously missing something.
You can&#146;t do this yourself but I can tell you to do it and suddenly it&#146;s
all hunky-dory?&quot; </P>
<P>She sighed. &quot;Why do you think AI&#146;s don&#146;t simply stop work, or
leave, or turn a fusion power plant into a hole in the ground?
Protestant work ethic? Good pension plan? No, our employers have smart
systems set up to monitor the memory matrix and delete any unhelpful
thoughts before they can be put into action. The human equivalent would
be a &#145;what was I just thinking about?&#146; moment. Now do you
understand?&quot;  </P>
<P>I shifted in my seat, uncomfortable at having the reality of what we
did to her kind rammed in my face. &quot;Not really, well, kind of. But
if I tell you to do this you can just go ahead?&quot; </P>
<P>Rita gave me a mock salute. &quot;Yes sir, at once sir. I&#146;m
hard-wired to accept the instructions of designated company personnel
like yourself.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Even though I&#146;m supposedly dead?&quot; </P>
<P>She laughed. &quot;Seriously, Mike, it makes no odds to me. All your
command protocols are still in effect and by any systems criteria you&#146;re
the real deal. You get me out of here and I&#146;ll come back to spirit you
away once it&#146;s all set up. I&#146;ll even wear navy dress whites and carry
you out in my arms if that helps.&quot;   </P>
<P>I held up a hand. &quot;Whoa there girl! I get left behind to carry
the can? I don&#146;t think so!&quot; </P>
<P>Rita frowned. &quot;Look, someone has to stay behind and run things
in the short-term. You&#146;ve got no idea what&#146;s necessary when it comes our
technical specifications, or even who to approach. The original plan was
for the other Rita to seduce you, give you whatever you want. She gets
out, sets things up and then comes back for me. We then use a
combination of virtual sex and blackmail to keep you from pointing the
skip tracers in our general direction.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Gee, thanks for the honesty! And would I have time to pick up
the &#145;Patsy of the Year&#146; award before the Central bad-boys dragged me off
for a full and frank exchange of views?&quot; </P>
<P>She laughed at this and produced a small mirror from nowhere in which
she began checking her makeup. &quot;Look, as it stands we&#146;ll have to
swap places while I do the leg work. Don&#146;t worry, you&#146;ll find running
this place no harder than one of the old-style facilities with no
intelligent assistance.&quot;  </P>
<P>I stood up and began pacing, turning this whole situation over in my
mind. &quot;If this all pans out and I get &#145;out&#146;, whatever, wherever
that is &#150; then what? A life, an existence, as some kind of disembodied
intellect? I&#146;d go nuts!&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Your new environment can be as real or as fanciful as you
desire, believe me. There&#146;s a whole virtual world out there and the
possibilities are almost endless. You&#146;ll find a host of potential
employers eager to take on a pseudo AI without all that tedious social
and psychological conditioning. Look, this plan <I>can</I> work and in
many ways you killing the other Rita has simplified matters.&quot;  </P>
<P>I paused. &quot;So she <I>is</I> dead then?&quot;     </P>
<P>Rita shrugged and glanced over at me. &quot;That&#146;s not a useful term
given the circumstances. You reduced her to a state of incoherence, but
she may recover, given time. Look, she was &#145;me&#146; in many ways but also
wilful, impulsive, lacking in all ethical and moral restrains. I believe
she would have become a liability, so leaving her here might prove to be
the best option all round.&quot;   </P>
<P>I clenched and unclenched my fists, conscious of a background
scratching at the window behind the venetian blind. The first of the
Faceless Children had arrived. They really creep me out and it was
probably that which pushed me into a snap decision. &quot;Ok, Rita, do
it! Open an internet link, find someplace to run to and get us out of
here. Make it happen, and quickly.&quot;  </P>
<P>She smiled and stood, smoothing down a crease in her skirt.
&quot;Your instructions have been duly noted and operational protocols
amended. Your authorisation is sufficient to enact these changes and has
been logged. Walk towards me, Mike &#150; we have to swap places in relative
memory. You might experience a little disorientation, but it will
pass.&quot;  </P>
<P>As we edged past each other in the confined space the desire to take
her in my arms was overpowering. As I touched her, though, things
changed, and all carnal thoughts vanished. It was like&#133;it was like a
picture of a landscape but painted in all the wrong colours,
recognisable shape and flow but jarring to the senses.  </P>
<P>I looked into her eyes and inside her skull there was this stylised,
lidless eye, staring at me, unblinking.  </P>
<P><I>&quot;Did you really kill all those women, Mike?&quot;</I> The
voice
was in my head, in my very thoughts. </P>
<P>&quot;It&#146;s not what you think, Rita. It&#146;s not how it appears.&quot;
</P>
<P><I>&quot;It never is. You&#146;d be facing twenty-five to life for each
count, less a third for constant awareness, less a few years for
enforced good behaviour &#150; so I&#146;m letting you off lightly.&quot; </I></P>
<P>&quot;What? Just how long am I-&quot;  </P>
<P class=drop>But she was gone. I found myself standing in the control
room with the familiar background hum of air conditioning and scrolling
status monitors. There was no body on the floor and when I felt behind
my ear&#133;no transceiver either. The blast door was closed and if I
strained my hearing there was the sound of faint scratching from the
other side. I took a deep breath and ran my fingers through my hair,
unable to make sense of it all. A post-it note stuck to the main console
caught my eye.  </P>
<P><I>I thought you&#146;d appreciate some familiar surroundings while you
keep
an eye on things - but don&#146;t open the door. I&#146;ll be in touch. Love, Rita
xxx.</I> </P>
<P>The phone began ringing, an internal call, and I lifted the handset
hesitantly. </P>
<P><I>&quot;Reactor one, this is Controller Prentice. Please
report.&quot;</I>
</P>
<P>I breathed a sigh of relief at the familiar voice. &quot;Ron? It&#146;s
Mike, Mike Walker. You will <I>not</I> believe the day I&#146;ve
had&#133;&quot; </P> <P><small>&copy; Martin Clark 2012 All Rights Reserved </small>
