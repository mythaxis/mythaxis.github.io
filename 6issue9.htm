<div><i>Is handwritten evidence reliable?<P></i>
<I>May 2373 - Account from Professor Mrs Kerstin Johansson,
(semi-retired) of the University of Uppsala</I> <P><p class=drop>In my job, I see a lot of writing, not just on paper, but
carved into stone, metal or wood. As an archaeologist at the 
University of Uppsala, ancient writing is one of the basic data sources
for my science. In particular, handwriting is one  of my specialities,
which, I suppose, is one of the reasons why Olaf Ekman's Book arrived at
my workstation, eleven years ago. <P>Writing by hand is a rarity these days. We see any amount of printed
paper, and lots of tablet notes in a variety of font 
styles, but beyond that... what? People sometimes sketch preliminary
ideas on paper. Shopping lists, score cards, 
yellow sticky notes. The majority of paper manufactured today is used in
an absorbent form to soak up or wipe up spills 
or bodily exudations. You can't write on a nose tissue. I've tried. <P>Writing being such a rarity, I was surprised that the book was
accompanied in its mailpouch by a handwritten note on a 
plain sheet of heavy paper, signed by the Dean himself. It said, in essence: <P>1. Do not disclose anything connected with this book to anyone other
than me. Do not file any data connected with this 
project on any computer database. Use only a secure, non-networked computer for your report. <P>2. You are required to analyse the attached book for authenticity of
origin and language, both in its basic form and, as 
far as possible, with reference to the handwritten additions. Pay particular attention to dates. <P>3. Transcribe into English the handwritten additions to the text. <P>4. Submit a single printed report of your conclusions to me in person.  <P>I was not permitted to retain a copy of the report I submitted, but the
task was so unusual that I still clearly remember 
almost  everything about it. <P>Ekman's 'Book' was actually an old bible. We see a lot of bibles,
q'rans, little red books  and other religious and political 
tracts in the archaeology business. During most of the history of
printing, religious books in particular were produced 
in huge quantity, so it is not surprising. Besides, in historical times,
superstition made people reluctant to destroy holy 
books, which often survived for many years after their original publication. <P>This bible was a dog-eared volume some one hundred and forty millimetres
tall, ninety-five millimetres wide and forty 
millimetres thick, as I remember. It had a soft cover of black imitation
leather, torn and scuffed. It was grubby and it 
smelled strangely musty, as though it had been in close contact with animals. <P>The paper was extremely thin, presumably to make the volume as
physically small as possible. Each sheet was only 
0.05 millimetres thick, so that 1000 pages (500 sheets) measured only 25 mm.  <P>Bibles were traditionally divided into major sections called 'books',
subsections called 'chapters', and short passages 
called 'verses'. The print was small, in two columns per page, with each
Book named, and each Chapter and Verse 
numbered. <P>The publication date of this Holy Bible was 2145, over 200 years old
when I first saw it. It was in English, published in 
London at the Hackney University Press, and must have been one of the
last so-called King James versions published, 
the earliest examples of which date from the 1600s. By 2145, the 17th
century language used was unfamiliar to nearly all 
speakers of English, and the bible in use was commonly rendered in
contemporary language, just as on-line versions 
are today. <P>I sent samples of the cover, paper and ink of the bible for analysis,
without revealing their source. The plastic cover and 
the paper were the right age, the printing ink correct. I was able to
borrow another copy of exactly the same edition from 
Stockholm University library, and it was identical, other than wear and
tear; the physical appearance, the pagination, 
font, printer's marks, even the few accidental flecks that always used
to appear on a printing plate.  On balance, forgery 
of the book itself was very unlikely. <P>However, what made this bible interesting was that almost every blank
space - end-papers, margins and chapter breaks 
- was filled with handwriting in ballpoint pen, whose ink was initially
consistent with the age of the entries. Later entries 
were in a more primitive ink which later turned out to be coffee. The
book, or diary, was, in fact, a palimpsest. The 
original meaning of the bible text apparently meant nothing to the writer. <P>I remember that, at first, I didn't even realise that the handwriting
was in Swedish. Swedish is theoretically my native 
language, but here in the twenty-fourth century, there are few daily
speakers of the language. It was hard to recognise, 
because the handwriting was atrocious. Even after a lifetime of
deciphering ancient documents, I found it extremely 
difficult to read, and the writer, in search of writing space, had
filled all the big areas before resorting to margins and 
column gutters, and the whole narrative was therefore out of sequence,
and the writer clearly lost track of dates very 
early in his account. <P>In my opinion, the language and handwriting style used were consistent
with a Swedish male educated within rural 
Sweden in the early part of the twenty-second century, about two hundred
years ago. For the language, I based my 
assessment on similar documents of comparable age: the vocabulary
(especially the paucity of imported English and 
other foreign words); punctuation; grammar; and sentence structure used.
For the handwriting, my clues were letter 
shapes and connectors, and, particularly, accents and diacritical marks. <P>As to content, the writer calls himself Olaf Ekman. There was no
immediate way to verify this. He was unclear where he 
was living, lacked company, was unclear about his situation but
had adjusted to it. The account was 
long, repetitive and tedious. It also lacked biographical detail. <P>Using parish and census records, I was able to identify more than two
hundred possible Olaf Ekmans living in Sweden at
the approximate period, but there was insufficient supporting historical
data in his written account for a positive 
identification. Certainly, several of these Ekmans lacked information on
date and place of death, but emigration to other 
countries typically interrupts the life records of individuals living at that time. <P>In conclusion, while I was unable to comment on any possible delusion on
the part of Olaf Ekman, the physical book
appeared entirely authentic, and the style of the palimpsest content was
entirely consistent with Ekman's assertions as 
to year of writing. <P>Prof. Kerstin Johansson. May 2373. <P><hr> <P><I>Appendix <P>Some extracts from Olaf Ekman's writings. As I state in the body of this
account, the whole is both
boring and baffling. Part of the confusion results 
from the fact that Ekman does not initially reveal that he is living in
a supermarket delivery van. Late in the account, he 
reveals that the bible, which some other driver had left in the cab, was
not the only paper available to him, but that he 
valued the other paper for lighting fires. He would never burn a bible,
apparently. However, the ball-point pen he had in 
his pocket was the only writing implement available. The pen ran out
before the available paper in the bible and the last 
entries are laboriously scratched with something dipped in a dye made
from coffee. The van load, luckily for Ekman, 
was mostly preserved foodstuffs with a few other everyday items and some women's clothing.</I> <P>1 June 2151: My name is Olaf Ekman. I have been here for about a month,
but I do not remember how I came. The last 
date I clearly remember is  3 May 2151, so I shall call today 1 June. I
have shelter, there is more than enough to eat and 
drink, but my life is empty. I have not seen another person, bird or
animal since I arrived. The van is completely out of 
fuel and the GPS and radio light up but appear to be broken. The solar
panels collect a little energy, but not enough to 
drive the van any distance. Tomorrow I shall walk to the west (the
position of the setting sun) in the hope of 
encountering a neighbour or a road. <P>12 June 2151: Ten days and I was lucky to get home. The terrain is flat
and almost treeless in all directions from here. 
After two days pushing through alternate stony desert and ankle-deep,
flat-leaved vegetation, I came to a low hill, but 
the view from the top, in all directions, was exactly the same. I had
taken enough food for seven days, turned back after 
three, and missed the van on the way back. It took three days to find
it. Perhaps this is Canada. Are there volcanoes in 
Canada?  <P>20 June 2151: I managed to cut down one of the tall plants, about ten
metres high, with a kitchen knife from the van. The 
wood is soft like a cactus, and very light. There was a box of balls of
string in the delivery. I tied a very bright yellow 
frock to the top of the pole, and managed to fix it to the van as a
flagstaff. I will not miss the van next time I explore. I 
have decided to climb the volcano. I will see more from there. <P><I>It appeared to take Ekman several months to achieve this objective.
The volcano was so far away that he was forced 
make huge numbers of part trips to set up supply caches en route because
he could not carry enough food and water 
for the complete journey. In turn, this meant that he needed to signpost the route from cache to cache. </I> <P>20 October 2151: So, in summary, the trip to the volcano was not a total
waste of time. From near the top, it was clear 
that I am on an island, and it appears uninhabited. Although I never see
any aircraft, I am building a sign to attract 
attention and will keep a fire burning day and night in hope of rescue. <P>25 October 2151: It rains a lot here, with remarkable thunder and
lightning. It is difficult to keep the fire lit. It is good that 
the load includes a whole case of gas lighters. <P>6 November 2151: The moon looks smaller from here. Maybe it is the flatness of the land.  <P><I>There follow twenty-two years' worth of increasingly sporadic
entries, most may be summarised by 'got up, ate 
tinned stew, it rained, collected fuel for the fire, went to sleep', a
pattern which must be a feature of the life of any 
castaway. The constant fire was abandoned when it took nearly a day to
collect a day's fuel. Every so often, when the 
solar panels had accumulated a little energy, he moved the van a few
hundred yards to another area with more fuel. 
Eventually, he was only a day's walk from the sea, but his attempts to
catch fish were unsuccessful. He never saw 
another living creature on land or in the sea. Latterly, entries were
interspersed by occasional complaints of this 
type:</I> <P>12 September 2166: Becoming worried that the tins of food will only last
a few more years. I have finally tasted the red 
bush fruit that look like little jugs that I always thought would be
poisonous. I was right. They were almost tasteless, but 
caused terrible stomach pain. So far, there is nothing at all on this
island that I can eat except the tomatoes and grapes 
that still sprout on my dungheap, and I think I brought these here
myself! Happily, the rain water, though it tasted 
strange at first, has always been OK. <P><I>It should have been a soul-destroying existence, very much like a
life sentence in solitary confinement, yet Ekman 
appears to have accepted it without either complaint or curiosity. There is no self-pity even in the last entry of all:</I> <P>1 January 2173: Happy New Year. I opened the last tin today - one I have
been keeping for a final treat - peaches. I hate 
to think how much I owe DK-Mart Supermarkets - a whole delivery! I
estimate 20000 kg of tinned and packet food alone, 
not counting the soft drinks, beer and vodka. And all these ladies'
dresses and sandals I used when my overalls and 
boots wore out! There is no more food, so when I get hungry I will eat
as many painkillers as I can and fall asleep. I am 
sorry, DK-Mart, you will never be paid. Let us say that I have taken my salary in kind. Goodbye. <P><I>Ekman's death occurred two hundred years ago this year. We still do
not know how he came to be marooned.</I> <P><hr> <P><p class=drop>Kerstin showed her unexpected visitor into her kitchen.
The man had
arrived unannounced, presented his identity 
badge to her entry scanner, and been admitted without delay and without
requiring Professor  Kerstin Johansson's 
permission. This was the sign of a very important person. <P>"Coffee?" she offered. <P>"No, thank you. This is your report, recorded recently, is it, Professor?" <P>Kerstin Johansson regarded the rather pale young man with rising
suspicion. He had a friendly face, but that meant 
little these days. He had unrolled a flekskreen, and  passed it across
the kitchen table. She recognised the article she 
had posted on the net the previous day. "Who did you say you were?" She
had been so surprised at his arrival that she 
had not read the admission read-out on her entry screen. <P>"Anders Lid&eacute;n, UN Truth Commission. Your article, is it?" <P>"Yes, but I fail to see the problem." <P>"You are aware that your work on this project was highly confidential." It was a statement, not a question.  <P>She suddenly perceived that Lid&eacute;n's blue eyes were acutely
piercing. Her stomach sank. The UN Truth 
Commission had a reputation for ruthlessness in the pursuit of academics
who crossed the line. "Confidential, yes, but 
eleven years downstream? And it's a sad story, someone marooned for so
long, but it can hardly be important. It 
happened so long ago - two hundred years this year. That's why I wrote the memoir." <P>"And you were given leave to publish by whom?" <P>"No-one. But this is not my original report, which I agreed to keep
confidential, just a memoir." <P>He pursed his lips. "Hmm.. A prevarication. And the quotes from your
transcript of Ekman's journal?" <P>"They were not quotes! You will probably see differences from the
original transcript... I... er... kept images of a few 
pages and re-translated them." <P> Lid&eacute;n rolled up the flekskreen and returned it to his hip bag.
 "A memoir, you say. Could your memory be faulty, 
do you think?" He was watching her carefully. <P>"I don't believe so. I was careful not to guess anything that I could not clearly remember." <P>"Such as?" <P>"Lab results. Number of journal entries. I don't know. How long the investigation took." <P>"I see." <P>"Look. If the information is still secret, then I'll withdraw the net release." <P>"Oh, it was withdrawn this morning, and cleared from all public caches.
There may be a few copies in private hands, but 
without the original, they lack substance. We can handle that sort of thing."  <P>"So, will I be prosecuted for breach of confidentiality?" <P>"Oh, I hardly think so. A prosecution would be too noticeable. No, we
want you to publish, but with certain small 
changes." <P>Kerstin could feel her hackles rising at the prospect of being forced to
publish a lie at the request of the Truth 
Commission. She knew it happened, but not, surely, to archaeologists. "I
don't understand. Was this Ekman 
important?" <P>"You were never told where the book was found?"  It was clearly
Lid&eacute;n's turn to be surprised. He immediately 
appeared less menacing. <P>"No. I wondered at the time, but I wasn't asked to speculate. It seemed
shocking that he was never found, but I suppose 
there are still remote places like that, even today." <P>Lid&eacute;n deployed his flekskreen again and opened a form. "As things
stand, your report is suppressed. If you 
endorse this official security form, I will give you some information.
The form is specific to this information and does not 
constrain you in any general fashion. If we later discover that you have
revealed that information, you will be 
sanctioned. On the basis of the information I give you, you may decide
to publish your report with changes we suggest. 
Otherwise, it remains suppressed." <P>"In short, I have nothing to lose, but not a lot to gain, either." <P>"True. But you are now fascinated to discover the secret. That's a gain." <P>"All right. I am fascinated." <P>"OK. Look at the screen until the retinal scan clicks, and then say 'I
endorse form number ' and read the number on the 
screen." <P>The familiar formality complete,  Lid&eacute;n began. "The book and Ekman's remains were found in 2268." <P>"But that was, what, nearly a hundred years before it came to me. Yet I remember a sense of urgency." <P>"That is because, even with the fastest transport  available, it took nearly a hundred years to get to you." <P>"I don't understand." <P>"Yes you do." <P>"Of course. A space colony." <P>"Pacifica, formerly called HD69830-4. The starship UNSS Shardik was
launched in 2080, when it was feared that our 
planet might soon become uninhabitable. Like the other starships
launched in the late 21st, Shardik carried a 
population of 50000 crew, a self-sustained town. Travelling at an
average of approximately one quarter light speed, 
Shardik arrived in orbit around Pacifica a hundred and eighty-eight
years later. A few of the older travellers could 
remember their grandfathers telling them about Earth, but none had known
any environment but Shardik. Most had been Shardik natives for six or
seven
generations. As you know, a number of starships have failed as a result
of accident, breakdown or civil anarchy, but 
Shardik was a great success." <P>"Yes. I've read about it." <P>"During computer analysis of the aerial survey on the planet Pacifica,
shape
anomalies were identified. Most anomalies in the 
survey turned out, on closer inspection, to be unusually regular natural
features. However, telescopic images revealed 
that one island had on it," he consulted his screen, "a rectangular
structure some fifteen metres in length and three in 
width, and, nearby, some arrays of rocks, hundreds of metres in extent
and partially obscured by low vegetation, 
reading 'SOS', a traditional distress signal. A landing vehicle was
immediately deployed to the site,
and it was revealed that the rectangular object 
was an antique road vehicle containing the remains of a human being. The
human remains and a few personal effects 
were returned to UNSS Shardik, where they were subject to analysis in their laboratory." He looked up. <P>Kerstin grimaced. "They couldn't read Ekman's journal." <P>"They could read the dates, though. The publication date of the bible.
And the expiry dates on Ekman's cans and 
bottles. And they were not pleased." <P>"I'm beginning to see why." <P>"You and your family for several generations travel for a hundred and
eighty-eight years, only to discover that
a supermarket delivery vehicle has beaten you to 
your destination by one hundred and seventeen years." <P>"I see. So Shardik's crew theorised that we, on Earth, had developed a
much faster transport system, making their 
marathon journey and lost generations a bit meaningless." <P>"Exactly. Radio messages to and from Pacifica take forty-six and a bit
years each way, so a lively exchange of views is 
impossible. But we received images of the bible about sixty years ago.
Travelling by very fast unmanned capsule, the 
bible itself arrived together with soil samples and other physical
artifacts from Pacifica just eleven years ago, when you 
saw it." <P>"Presumably, then, UNSA have, indeed, developed a much faster space drive, but do not want to talk about it." <P>"In point of fact, no. UNSA has achieved marginal improvements in ram
ion drives, but nothing that would transport 
Ekman and his truck almost instantaneously.  It was concluded at this
end that since it was impossible, the crew of 
Shardik must have contrived an incomprehensible elaborate  practical
joke, mocking up photographs of the bible, the 
truck, the food cans." <P>"And then I certified Ekman's book as real." <P>"Exactly." <P>"So how did Ekman get to Pacifica?" <P>"That's just it. It can't possibly have happened. Therefore, it did not
happen. Therefore, the whole tale must be a clever 
fake, and your report must make that clear." <P>Kerstin stared at, or, rather, through Lid&eacute;n for a few seconds.
"No. I don't believe it. Disregarding the fact that a 
joke like that is highly unlikely, the bible is genuine. I'm sure of it." <P>"Yes, I'm sure it is." said Lid&eacute;n, "But if the real truth got
out, it would have the most depressing effect on morale. 
Asking you to put a little doubt into the situation is much preferred." <P>"The real truth? All I can imagine is that it was all faked at this end and Shardik's crew made no such discovery." <P>"Not at all. As far as the inhabitants of Pacifica are concerned, it's a
historical fact, and the truck is on view there for 
anyone to see, as you can confirm with your own eyes if you have a couple of centuries to spare." <P>"Are you saying you know how it happened?" <P>"Not in detail, but it is simply another confirmation of a phenomenon
that has been happening since the mid twentieth 
century. The vast majority of these incidents are virtually dismissed.
Anyone pursuing them is regarded as a crank, 
Ekman's case is embarrassing because he turned up a long way from home with supporting physical evidence."  <P> Lid&eacute;n displayed an image of a piece of yellowed paper, printed in Swedish. <P>"What's this?" asked Kerstin, but went on translating aloud,
" 'Bure&aring; Weekly News 5 May 2151'. It's one of those
local newspapers from country backwaters that survived net news because
local events were never reported on the 
net. The date. It's something to do with Ekman, isn't it?" <P>"This may explain why we have no wish to provide confirmation of the
likely explanation."  Lid&eacute;n enlarged a 
small paragraph at the foot of the page.  <P>Kerstin read the brief article quickly. "Ah, small and green, are they?" <P>"Allegedly. We've never caught them in the act." <P>"I can see why me making a mistake is preferable to this." <P>"We hoped you'd see it that way." <P> <hr> <P><div class=t1>Googlefish translation follows:<br><br>
CELESTIAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY<br><br>
On Wednesday night several inhabitants of Skellefte&aring; reported
seeing strange lights travelling across the sky from west to  east at
remarkable speed, making sharp changes of direction and changing colour
from white to pink and back again. Some witnesses reported strange
noises. A farmworker, Karin Lindemann (42), alleged that she was
'bombarded with live frogs'. A huge cylindrical depression was found in
an oilseed rape field, surrounded by burn marks.<br><br>
<img src="nyheter.jpg" align=right> The local UN radar base at Pitea
reported that nothing was seen on their screens, and a spokesman
confided that the villagers had most probably observed the aurora
borealis. Electricity worker Frederik Hansen (55) dismissed this
suggestion, as all local people at this latitude are familiar with the
northern lights. He said this was not the first time that unusual lights
had appeared in the night sky (see Bure&aring; Weekly News 14 Mar 2150),
and that a UN soldier from the radar installation had revealed that the
lights did in fact appear on radar, but were denied by the
authorities.<br><br>In a possibly connected incident on the same
evening, a DK-Mart delivery
truck disappeared on the coast road between Yttervik and Skelleftehamn
It is feared that the driver, Olaf Ekman, may have been distracted by
the
strange lights and plunged into the sea. Coastguards and police have so
far failed to establish the truth of this theory.</div> <P>
