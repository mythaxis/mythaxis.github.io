<div align=center><img src="bronze.jpg"><BR><h2>The Man with Bronze Hair</h2><BR><h3>Les Sklaroff</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>"Roots are not in landscape or a country, or a people, they
are inside you." <small>Isabel Allende</small></i>
<p class="drop">A
few of those involved in the unauthorized landscaping in Smatparrox
knew the bronze-haired man as Farras Grein.  They were
well-motivated, and knew better than to discuss either their work or
his identity with strangers.  They were also well-paid, but this was
incidental to the satisfaction afforded by the importance of what
they jointly aimed to achieve.  There was good reason for the secrecy
of their activities.</P> <P>Rural
hamlets are sometimes described as &lsquo;sleepy&rsquo;.  Smatparrox,
sadly, was comatose.  It was not an unattractive place, but its
amenities had been allowed to decline until the liveliest local
feature was the traffic on the bypass. It was a place from which
those in search of education, work, health-care or public
entertainment were obliged to commute, provided they could safely
negotiate the potholes in the roads.  An oppressive bureaucracy clung
like a suffocating miasma over the workings of Smatparrox Council. 
Any threat to the <i>status quo</i> would set in motion a host of
defensive
measures, supported by ancient statute ready to be cited with
wearying detail by their overstaffed legal department.  It was one of
the hangovers from feudal times which had so far resisted any attempt
at modernisation, along with the rest of that sorry place. <P><div class=pullquote>"It will shock them into wakefulness"</div>With
eight years of research behind him, and the results overwhelmingly
positive, the man who called himself Farras Grein was impatient to
implement his plan.  Knowing that overt action would have been met
with petty obstructions, he had carefully recruited a trustworthy
group with knowledge of the local terrain and an enthusiasm for the
project.  He intended to present Smatparrox with a <I>fait
accompli</I>. <P>Fortunately, a minimum of equipment was required for their nocturnal
operations,
so the chances of detection were reduced.  Essentially, all that was
needed for each procedure was a grid reference and a means of digging
a precise cluster of holes.  Careful insertion of the seeding and
nutrient-release mechanism would then be followed by any necessary
camouflage of the resulting mound. <P>Although
the clandestine planters were never actually observed, inexplicable
signs of disturbance to the faded municipal flower-beds or other
public spaces were blamed on moles, until the curiously regular
distribution of the mounds was eventually noticed.  Suspecting some
kind of sabotage, and fearful of hidden traps, the Council belatedly
called for an investigative team from Snoak. <P>Snoak
citizens rarely had cause, or indeed sufficient interest to visit
Smatparrox.  The Snoak Detechs were still pursuing their own urban
anomalies, and could not be spared, but on learning that it was a
landscape-related matter, Central thought it would do no harm to
provide a few under-employed cartographers, who might conceivably
benefit from an aerial view of the ground. <P>By
that time Farras Grein's biotaps had already begun to interlock their
root system, and were rising to greet the sun. <P>Biotaps
were in effect artificial trees, the product of research and
development at the Quicksilver laboratories in Snoak City, the same
scientific stable which had achieved success with SunCell MonoPods. 
They were self-regulating energy-storage and conversion devices which
used an enhanced form of photosynthesis to yield a high degree of
efficiency with no harmful by-products. <P>The
man known as Farras Grein was himself a native of Smatparrox, and it
had long been among his ambitions to be a catalyst for change in what
many regarded as that provincial backwater.  The provision of
virtually free energy could only be a change for the better.  He had
said as much to his beautiful voluntary cohab and confidante, Sarsel
Bridge4th, the herpetologist, whom he had met at a conference on
solar energy and biosystems, where he had been greatly impressed by
her paper (<I>&lsquo;Spectrometric Analysis of UVB Transmission in
Reptilian Chemotaxis&rsquo;</I> ) before it struck him that she was
also a very attractive woman. <P>&quot;It will shock them into wakefulness, Pi,&quot; she had said, the
night he had first told her about the project.  &quot;And not before
time. 
It's the fresh start they've been needing.  But are you ready to take
the credit when the demand for biotaps turns global?  Even you won&rsquo;t
be able to keep this scheme of yours from attracting world-wide
attention.  The publicity is bound to become very persistent.&quot; <P>What
was not generally known about Farras Grein was that he and
Quicksilver's reclusive founder, Pion Octyl diMotz, were one and the
same.  He had paused before answering, granting her one of his
enigmatic smiles.  &quot;That remains to be seen, my love. 
Meanwhile, I rather look forward to the excitement of escaping from
the confines of the lab.&rdquo;   A mischievous thought occurred to
him.  &ldquo;We could venture out incognito.  You can help me choose
a suitable disguise, and we&rsquo;ll give the Quanderpyre press
something else to gossip about.  Shall we sleep on it?&rdquo; <P>Sarsel
had unclipped the exquisite gold snake bracelet which he had bought
her from Smigs in Yarp Street, and turned to him with a giggle that
some would have been surprised to hear from the lips of such a
reputable scientist. <P><p class=drop>There was no question about the biotaps&#146; efficiency.  They
had been programmed to optimize their performance, drawing radiant and
chemical sustenance from air and earth.  Their roots developed
protective sheathing, formed junctions from which small quasi-metallic
tubers rose to ground level, from where they emitted enticing
pheromones.  On the gently questing stems of each main trunk, the shiny
leaf-blades flashed, sucking in photons, strengthening the
pseudo-plant&#146;s defensive capabilities.  Here and there little blobs and
heaps of organic matter continued to be absorbed, the remains, perhaps,
of unwary wildlife.  Under one particular biotap, of the thousands that
now occupied what was once Smatparrox, close to a slowly liquefying
visor, a few wiry strands of bronze hair had already been half swallowed
by the rapacious soil. <P><small>&copy;Les Sklaroff 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
