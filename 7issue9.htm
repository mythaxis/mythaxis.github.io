<i>Tell us something<br>
(Anything)<br>
 (Yes)</i> <P>I'll tell you about my day. You always know we're coming because we
advertise: our kites go up days in advance, their lasers streaking the
clouds and high rises; adver-screamers roam the streets, hacking phones
and kits, flooding your width with promises. You know what we are - it's
not a secret, it's a selling point - and you dare each other to buy
tickets, to make a night of it. You look ahead and insert yourself into
this scenario. But you're never prepared.  <P><i>Yes <br>
 (She's right) <br>
(Tell us why)</i> <P>You've been spoilt. You're used to 3D Virt, GamingR, ExtraLife and all
the other reality playrooms and you forget this is real, that we are
real, the way a line of code or a pixelated image just isn't. It takes
about twenty minutes to sink in. Then you start to react. <P><i>What happens?<br>
(Are we afraid?)<br>
(I wasn't)	<br>
 (You were)</i> <P>It's never the same. It depends where we are.  <P><i>Meaning?<br>
 (I don't understand)</i> <P>Hang on. It doesn't take me long to make up: I only have to pull on the
dress, throw on some paint, brush and balance this wig - <P><i>Pretty<br>
 (Not real?)</i> <P>- no, not real. I can't even dye my hair. My skin won't take the
chemicals. Because I have free time, I take a few hours to wander each
town. No-one ever realises what I am; I wear a hood and walk the strips,
past the screamers for other shows, sizing up the competition. I'm
looking for a certain type of small shop, somewhere low and grimy. It
will have dirty windows. It will be dark and warm. I'll go inside and
buy a small paper card, running my fingers over the picture, shapes of
cliffs and beaches, and try to learn about my audience. <P><i>Tell us how<br>
(Quiet)</i> <P>It's my own theory: topographical mind mapping. Don't laugh.
Valleys-dwellers widen eyes and apertures but don't move, and they never
ask questions. Mountain-people are sceptics <i>- faked - it's a trick
-</i> and
can't wait to get past the dampers, get outside, plug in and find out
how it's done. Coastals, like here, are different again: silent
watchers, immediate believers. Accepters of myth and the secrets of deep
water. Of creatures left behind. <P><i>Yes. <br>(Go on)<br> (Tell us about here)</i> <P>I found my shop early. As I flicked through the dusty boxes the staff
watched me; they were hosting my advert for the show, but they had no
way of knowing, not without this wig, this paint. All they saw was a
girl. They were sitting on high chairs, leaning back
against the wall, icams
whirring as they focused on my face. <i>Are you going? We're selling
tickets.</i> Each had one eye milked as they paralleled, maybe watching
the
news, a movie, porn-porn of me perhaps; their cams might have been
chipped. Maybe, tucked inside their visual field, I was fucking a vid
creation, a beast, a bird, a monster. Maybe they were hurting me,
watching tears cut new patterns into my blood-stained face. Or maybe
they were just Booking.   <P>They had enough attention left over to complain
about accepting my coins after I exposed my wrist and told my usual lie.
<i>Chip magged, pain in the arse, I know...</i> At least they didn't
charge me
extra for having to use a card. <i>Where's it going, girly?</i> The
question
came out of nowhere, and for a second I thought I'd been recognised. I
stared.  <P><i>Postcard.</i> A real finger pointed to the image in my hand.
<i>Who're
you sending it to?</i> In situations like that I have learnt to smile,
shake
my head and leave. <P><i>(What happened)</i> <P>When I stepped out of the shop there were more bods on the strip, all
looking for a good time. It was getting late, the overheads brightening
the clouds, and there were clubbers outside Pleasure Plaza, calling,
dancing, happy that the working week was over. One skipped over, waving,
and I knew I must have been Booked, but again I could only shrug and
walk away. <P>In the distance the kites swooped and sang, advertising the show,
sending down words and pics to curve on the pavement. They go so high,
anchored by unbreakable steel strings, and the vibration hums upwards,
all the way up to the bright dancing body. I stood and watched. When
it's busy Davvers lets me launch them, unwinding the long loops, sending
them further up to beam back their message, FREEKSHOW 2NITE. Calling to
the crowds. Calling to you.
	
I took my picture back to the tent and propped it against my tray of
paints, so I could study it as I whitened my face, darkened my eyes; one
paper rectangle, framing a point of transition; sea and slate, blues and
greys, one into the other beneath mirroring skies. The natural state of
things. I knew you wouldn't be afraid. <P><i>Tell us more<br>
 (About the show)<br>
(Your words)</i> <P>Bunny always opens the act, voice as deep as your shock. Although only
one of the heads is actually alive, the other never lolls or dribbles.
It always blinks, and seems to look around. It wiggles its nose.
Sometimes, one of the eyes will droop in a wink. Bunny will see it, and
turn to the nearest member of the audience.  <i>Likes you,</i> Bunny
will say, practised leer on the living mouth. <i>Kiss?</i>  Then drop
forward and bring their mouthparts level. No one has ever kissed that
second mouth, which is strange, because Bunny gets a lot of action after
the curtain drops.
	
After the tumbling acts have been on, armPlants whizzing around the
arena, it's the animals. You always love the monkey wedding. I don't
know why. <P><i>Real animals?<br>
(I thought they were fake)<br>
(They look almost human!)</i> <P>As you saw, my act closes. It goes like this. The damping field cuts
in - no-one is allowed to vid me; it would ruin us if pics leaked - and
Bunny leads me out, our three heads bobbing to the sub-enhanced beat. I
sit, smooth my hands over this pink and yellow-striped dress, the whole
look designed to keep me on the right side of cartoon. I am not here to
frighten. <P><i>Why are you here?<br>
(Don't ask that)</i> <P>Well, I'm unemployable.  At first, it was this or nothing, and I
wouldn't smile, which made the audience fear me even more. But I came to
feel differently about it after the third show.  Someone put out their
hand and touched my face as I was doing my act, gently stroking me from
my hairline to my jaw, and thanked me. I asked what for. <i>Because we
forget,</i> they said, golden lip slot gleaming, <i>and we
shouldn't.</i> It made me feel important. When everyone had gone I
climbed up the tent, high up into the roof, and sat on the scaffolding.
I thought about what it means for people like you to see someone like
me. <P><i>Funny!<br>
(Educational)<br>
(An advert?)</i> <P>Perhaps. I think it's more a memory.  <P><i>Go on</i> <P>Lifting the cover is always a tense moment. Sometimes I can't identify
the contents, not at first, and I used to worry about a mistake being
made, something damaging or deadly or just not <i>right</i> - but I've
learnt to trust the team here. They've never let me down. Davvers'
ringruler routine is always perfect, carefully pitched to the crowd's
needs. I know I'm cared for. Davvers will even end the show early if I'm
getting too much of the wrong sort of attention - <P><i>Like what?<br>
(Are we hurting you?)<br>
(Shall we move back?)</i> <P>No, no, you're wonderful. Perfect, in fact. But I sometimes get the
after-effects of fear: pinching, scratching, offers of sex, of love, of
death. I never cry, that would be unprofessional, but Davvers is always
watching, always knows. Then long fingers reach though the crush of
flesh and fakes and draw me out, hiding me under that red tailcoat,
toplight flashing, volume up, roaring me to safety. <P>But not today. Today, everything went well. When I lifted the cover I
was overjoyed. Long green stems, heated with water vapour to soften
them; a small grey fish, also warmed in water, its bulging eye cast up
at me with a wink of seasoning. I was surprised for a moment, and then I
remembered where we are. They're still caught for sport round here, yes?
Someone knows someone who can keep a secret. I picked up the utensils
that none of you can name, and cut. Pushed. Lifted. <P>When the first piece of green went into my mouth I heard a voice.
<i>No.</i> I
chewed slowly, letting you watch the movement of my jaw muscles, knowing
you were picturing my teeth, my wet mouth. I swallowed, smiled, looked
down. Cut into the fish. <P>Davvers started up the low patter that's designed to cover stunned
silences. You were addressed as <i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>, part of the
ambience of the piece, and invited closer. You paused, and then surged,
a wave of bodies, leaning so far over that you knocked me with your
icams. <i>Excuse,</i> I heard, <i>Please,</i> and I smiled again, and
opened my mouth,
displaying the mashed and sticky pile. <P><i>And how do we make you feel?</i> <P>Although many of you came down to be with me, I know that others have
left in disgust. They are outside, Booking each other, chipped in to
whatever gives them comfort, on their way home. Some feel sorry for me,
that I have been neglected somehow. Some always contact authorities,
charities, to get me rescued, to get me healed. Kindly Plant surgeons
offer to work for free. Kindly businesses offer to pay. <P><i>But still you choose to remain you<br>
(Pure)</i> <P>No. Listen. This is important. Each time, afterwards, I explain how this
isn't a choice; my body rejected the Plants as fast as they're
implanted. I'm still just a girl, sat alone on the edges of
communication, of information, of life. There is no higher moral purpose
to this; just a blind person allergic to sticks. <P><i>But you are pure -</i> <P>What value is purity? If you can't change, you can't grow. I'm purest
stagnation. I'm the dullest grey. <P><i>Do you have time for more questions?</i> <P>No. Wait - yes, I do, but they are for you. I have a thousand. Can tell
me
what it means to see the sun sing? How does it feel to be inside the
mind of your lovers? To remember every day of your life? What is it like
to never be alone? <P><i>We cannot (Excuse) (Cannot) (You wouldn't under-)</i> <P>I know. This is why I ask you here. You mustn't falter now. Get out, go
as far as you can, and send back pictures. <P><i>And you?</i> <P>I'll always be here, looking up. I'll be your kite string.
