<div><i>&#147;In the absence of justice, what is sovereignty but organized
robbery?&#148; <small>St. Augustine</small></i>
<p class="drop">The inner airlock doors slid open and the
two of us stepped into the ship proper. There was no reception
committee, which is always a good start where larceny is concerned.
Frank glowered at our Spartan surroundings, but then again, he glowers
at everything. "Wealthy as sin and this is the best he can come up with?
I've seen better appointed bus shelters." <P>I had to admit the access corridor was functional to the point of
bleakness. Not exactly what you'd expect aboard a star yacht owned by
the reclusive tycoon, Lucien Ghent. Everyone we'd spoken to on the space
station had assured us the Scaramanga was a veritable star-faring
pleasure palace. Needless to say, none of the inhabitants of Nebula
Gateway had ever set foot aboard, but all knew of someone who had. <P>Our sources reported that Ghent had gone loopy - if you could break
<i>in</i>
then he'd let you walk <i>out</i> with as much loot as you could carry,
free
and clear. I'd done my research and that sounded mad enough to be true;
Ghent hadn't been seen in public for almost three years and seemed to
treat interpersonal contact as an unnecessary evil. He'd even replaced
most of the crew with automated systems, not that the Scaramanga was
going anywhere in a hurry. It was tethered to the space station by a
host of hawsers and semi-permanent umbilicals - a parasitic entity that
pretty much summed up the great man himself. <P>So it was a challenge, but seeing as how Frank is a psychopathic killer
and I can crack any electronic lock ever made, we figured it was worth a
punt. However, if our initial surroundings were anything to go by then
it looked like we'd be leaving empty handed. <P>There was a flash of light and I felt my skin tingle. Frank hissed at
me, as if keeping his voice down would somehow help. "You said we'd be
invisible to the on-board systems. So how come-" <P>A synthetic male voice issued from the wall speaker. "Welcome aboard the
Scaramanga. Gentlemen. Please wait one moment." <P>I could well understand the system's hesitation as my immediate social
circle were heavily into gender morphing. To get back in shape I'd taken
a blitz course of Tee-He, leaving me with a bad case of drug-induced
priapism. Strapping my dick down in an enforced 'dressing on the left'
had left me with a pronounced limp, to the extent I needed a walking
stick to get about. <P>Water vapor materialized around us, like we'd suddenly flown into a
cloud. I heard Frank cursing but he was lost, obscured by the billowing
white folds. As suddenly as it had appeared the mist dissolved away, as
if burnt off by the rising sun. <P>And it had. <P>We were standing on a rock outcrop, a kind of ersatz observation
platform jutting out from the hillside. The sun had just cleared the
ridge behind us, throwing the semi-tropical valley below into stark
relief. There was no sign of life, let alone civilization, to mar the
lush sweep of vegetation. Away to the left lay the blue haze of the
ocean, and that was that. We were at altitude, but nothing
uncomfortable. I took a deep breath of fresh air which quite lacked the
antiseptic tang I'd gotten used to during my time in space. <P>"It's quite something, don't you think?" The voice came from behind us;
male, sounding  amused. I knew instantly I was going to dislike him. <P>I turned awkwardly, leaning on my cane. The speaker and a woman stood a
few meters away. He appeared squat in comparison to his companion but
that was due to his wide shoulders and heavy-set features. The woman had
catwalk elegance and eyes the colour of dead neon. <P>The man gestured out across the valley. "It's a topographical recreation
of Madeira, an island on Earth, complete with micro-climate.
Occasionally we manifest a small villa down on the coast but other than
that the place is uninhabited. I find bringing visitors here, with its
sense of isolation, leaves them feeling-" <P>"Disconcerted?" I smiled. Frank chewed on a fingernail and said nothing. <P>Our host inclined his head. "Quite. I'm-" <P>"Arturo Roth, your employer's go-to guy and proxy on the board of
Ghent's corporations. Your companion is Sara Hotchkiss, the proverbial
'personal assistant'. But not personal enough, apparently, to warrant a
bodyguard when she leaves the ship. Whereas you, sir, never go anywhere
without a small army in tow. Some might call it paranoia but given the
number of enemies you've acquired I'd say your precautions are entirely
justified." <P>Roth kept up the smile although his eyes hardened. "I see you've done
your homework. Unfortunately you have us at a disadvantage as I rarely
interest myself in those who-" <P>"I'm Jerry. This is my brother, Frank." <P>Cutting him off like that obviously got under Roth's skin. He dropped
the forced good humour and his tone turned dismissive. "Well, it's been
a pleasure meeting you both. I'll leave you in the capable hands of Sara
for the duration of your stay but I'm afraid we won't meet again." <P>I grinned. "You never know. It's nice here, so Frank and I might still
be around when you get back. I have to say, as virtual reality
environments go this one is top-notch." <P>Roth paused in the act of turning away. "Virtual? Oh, no. This may be a
shining example of artifice but there's nothing artificial about it, I
assure you. And what I should have said is that you'll be dead long
before I return. Please accept my apologies for any confusion that might
have caused." Before I could reply he went from three-dimensional to
bas-relief to no more than a cardboard cut-out, and dissolved into
nothingness. <P>Frank giggled, nervously.  <P>With Roth gone Sara seemed to come alive but I cut in before she could
speak, pointing at the spot where her companion had stood. "That's a
phase-transfer distortion effect, meaning all <i>this</i>..." I gestured
around
us, "&#133;is a live matter stream. But it can't be, not on this scale. Even
if your ship were just one big fusion reactor it couldn't generate
nearly enough power to support a reality bubble this large." <P>She smiled; all perfect teeth and insincerity. "Ah, but the Scaramanga
is powered by a Beaumont Singularity, more than adequate for even our
exorbitant needs. All <i>this</i>, as you put it, exists merely as a
mote on
the event horizon." <P>I shied away and even Frank looked worried. My voice trembled. "Fuck
that! There's a damn good reason why a Beaumont is proscribed technology
these days. If your containment field so much as <i>twitches</i> then
this
ship, the station, maybe even the entire system, will collapse in an
instant. So if you don't mind my brother and I will piss off, sharpish." <P>Sara brushed an errant strand of hair back into place. "But I thought
you were here to rob us? Isn't that why you came aboard?" <P>"Look, sister, even if that were true then you have to admit the set-up
isn't exactly as advertised. Or is this all some elaborate joke where
Ghent lures us aboard and then watches while we starve to death in his
pocket-universe playpen?" <P>She laughed. "Oh, no, he really is indifferent to your fate, I assure
you. But being marooned here <i>will</i> be the penalty for attempting
to
escape upon your return to the ship proper. This is essentially a Stone
Age environment and I seriously doubt you possess the skills to survive
for long, even on a diet of fruit and wild vegetables." <P>"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Either we rob you blind or perish in the
attempt." I sniffed. "So, tell me, if we <i>do</i> manage to pull this
off,
will we get to meet Ghent in person?" <P>Sara seemed to consider this for a moment. "Well, I'm sure the novelty
would appeal to him, and he has been known to witness the climax of a
break-in attempt, if it's been sufficiently entertaining up to that
point." <P>"You're not exactly filling me with confidence here, girl. Still,
there's no point in hanging about. Frank?" He nodded, I nodded. "Right
then, Sara, let's be having you." <P>The world around us seemed to snap shut and open again. We were back in
the access corridor, on our own. I laid a hand on Frank's arm in case he
felt like bugging out, but I needn't have worried. He shook off my grasp
and flexed his fingers. "Anything to say we can't just murder everyone
and bugger off? I don't like being screwed with." <P>I snorted. "You and me both, man. However I think full-on homicide might
upset the natives a tad, so rein it in for now." <P>Frank grunted and set off along the corridor with me trailing in his
wake. My augmented vision was sensitive to electronic emissions and heat
bloom, but there were no obvious sensors or hidden anti-intruder
nasties. The phrase 'all too easy' sprang to mind but there was no
option but to press on. Around a dog-leg in the corridor we ran into a
set of double pressure doors blocking our path, with no obvious release
mechanism. <P>I heaved a sigh of relief. "So now it begins." <P>My companion shrugged. "Assuming they don't just open onto vacuum." <P>"That would be crude, and if anything this whole set-up reeks of
over-sophistication. Anyway, by my reckoning we've almost reached the
heart of the ship." <P>"See if you're wrong, I will <i>so</i> kick your arse in Hell." <P>I smiled, handed him my cane, and stepped up. My fingers contained an
embedded tracery of electro-magnetic sensors and micro induction field
generators, meaning I could 'feel' and manipulate circuitry - even when
they were concealed beneath layers of ceramic and armour plate. The
locking mechanism was complex, subtle and booby-trapped. Any attempt at
brute force would trigger the deployment of lateral reinforcement bars,
requiring a thermal torch to make any further headway. Not
insurmountable, and the whole setup seemed designed to frustrate and
annoy the intruder rather than stop him dead in his tracks. <P>I stepped back with a flourish as the doors slid open - to reveal a
short section of corridor and another set of doors. Frank gave me a slow
hand-clap as I limped forward and started over. <P>I opened the second set of doors. <P>And the third. <P>By the time I started in on the fourth set Frank was bored; scratching
Anarchist League graffiti on the walls using the metal tip of my cane. I
glared at him. "Will you stop that? It's an antique original, not some
cheap reproduction. This whole setup is giving me quite enough grief
without you busting my balls as well." <P>He pouted. "You're the technical one, so get technical. But I'm warning
you, if there's another set of bloody doors beyond this lot I'm breaking
out the binary explosive." <P>I snorted. "Oh, very subtle, I'm sure. Even if you did manage to blow a
hole big enough to climb through, don't you think the fire suppression
system might sit up and take notice? They usually go for oxygen
depletion in space, not retardant foam, and I for one don't fancy
finding out which is in use aboard this tub." <P>Frank grunted and switched to twirling my cane, majorette style, while I
got back to work. <P>The doors opened.  <P>Beyond lay a large oval chamber, surrounded by a mezzanine metal-grid
walkway that served no obvious purpose. At the far side, opposite the
doorway, stood a wide sofa. <P>Sara sat there, her arms stretched out along the back of the upholstery.
She gestured to the ice bucket and glasses on a side table. "A glass of
champagne to celebrate getting this far, gentlemen? I assure you it
contains no poison or sedative." <P>It was hard to pay attention as behind her, piled high as a backdrop,
was enough wealth to turn Ali Baba green with envy. I could see piles of
gold ingots, drifts of precious gems, works of art that hadn't been
heard of in over a century. Plus a selection of proscribed technology
that any major corporation would give their eye-teeth to
reverse-engineer. <P>Frank handed back my cane and we made our way over to our vapid hostess.
I bowed from the hips. "I'll join you, if I may, while Frank deals with
whatever comes next. And there is something coming next, isn't there,
Sara? After all, a series of locked doors seems somewhat perfunctory." <P>She patted the sofa beside her. I placed my cane on the table and sat
down, accepting the proffered glass of bubbly. Sara smiled. "Oh, we used
to have guards, electronic wizardry and an array of bio-mechanical
nightmares defending the treasure room. But every guard can be bribed,
every lock can be picked and every cybernetic entity corrupted. Now we
simply depend upon our Hideo." <P>As she spoke a man entered the room by the way we'd come, the doors
closing behind him. He was small, oriental, dressed like a dock-side
supervisor in short-sleeved khaki shirt and loose pants. The 'Hideo'
were a class of vat-grown assassin, stone killers from the genes up.
These neo-ninja possessed enough augmented senses and jacked-up reflexes
to make weaponry superfluous at close-quarters. <P>The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. <P>Main lighting died away to be replaced by a shifting array of
multi-coloured strobes mounted on the floor, gantry and ceiling.
Octagonal mirrored columns rose from the floor and began to rotate,
turning the chamber into a kaleidoscopic visual assault course. Frank
turned to face Hideo, drawing a handgun from the pocket of his coat. He
held his arms loosely by his sides, waiting. <P>Sara leaned in close to me, her tone conspiratorial. "What <i>is</i> he
carrying? It didn't show up on our weapons scan." <P>"A gas-powered needlegun. Ceramic and plastic, firing glass
projectiles." <P>She paused for a moment, frowning, as if listening to an internal voice.
Then she laughed and clapped her hands. "Oh, oh, a <i>themed</i>
robbery! We
haven't had one of those since The Joker and may I say how much we
appreciate the effort, <i>Mister Cornelius</i>." <P>I inclined my head by way of acknowledgment. "This setting is also a
tribute, and one no less obscure. Now, I'll sit this out, if you don't
mind. Frank is the one for the rough-stuff." <P>"Oh, absolutely. Although you do realise you'll share your brother's
fate?" She frowned. "Is he really your sibling?" <P>"Him? Christ, not even close, but we work well together. As to sharing
his fate, well, I wouldn't have it any other way." I sipped my
champagne. <P>Sara raised her voice. "Hideo, you may begin." <P>Hideo bowed.  <P>Frank pointed his gun at a spot three meters to Hideo's left, then seven
meters, then four meters to his right. His arm fell to his side. <P>Hideo's expression didn't change but his stance altered, almost
imperceptibly. <P>Frank pointed his gun at a spot five meters to Hideo's right, then six
to his left. His arm fell to his side. <P>Sara sounded more confused than concerned. "What <i>is</i> he doing? Is
it some
kind of ritual?" <P>I shook my head. "Frank is pointing at the positions, in sequence, where
your man planned to be." <P>"I don't understand. How is that possible?" <P>"I don't understand it either, but that's his singular talent. In combat
situations, where he's directly threatened, Frank can predict the
actions of his adversary." <P>Hideo bowed again, then turned and walked away, immediately lost
from view amidst the visual cacophony. <P>Now Sara sounded nervous. "What's going on? He can't simply leave." <P>"He's been defeated and is acknowledging that fact. No matter what he
does, no matter how random his movements, Frank will nail Hideo before
he gets within reach." <P>Frank's arm snapped up and he fired off to his right; the
<i>twee-twee-twee</i>
of a three-round burst barely audible. The columns ceased rotating and
descended. The strobes cut out, to be replaced by main lighting. <P>A small, crumpled, khaki figure lay on the decking. <P>I sighed. "He had to try, I suppose, even though he knew it was a futile
gesture. Failure in his line of work isn't habit forming." Frank
giggled, spun the needlegun on his finger, and returned it to his
pocket. I stood up, placed my glass on the table and retrieved my cane. <P>Sara's face registered surprise and anger before settling for a forced
smile. "Congratulations, gentlemen. It would be churlish of me not to
honour the terms of our agreement, even if it was only a rumour.
Therefore, to the victors, the spoils. So please take whatever you can
carry and depart, with my blessing." <P>I twisted the silver top of my swordstick, unlocking the blade. With one
draw-and-slash I severed Sara's throat, right through to the spinal
cord. Her head fell back, dangling down the back of the sofa, secured to
the torso by only a few tendons and strip of skin. Blood fountained,
causing me to step away. <P>Frank chewed his bottom lip. "Messy. You should have let me plug her." <P>"No disrespect, man, but I had to make sure of taking out her central
nervous system." I walked around to the far side of the sofa and lopped
off the top of Sara's skull. "Come look." He edged around the spreading
blood pool and peered at the dull-blue crystal lattice I'd uncovered. I
gestured with my swordstick. "Frank, meet Lucien Ghent." <P>He sniffed. "So he's not Roth then? You were taking one hell of a risk." <P>"Not Roth, he's got all the finesse of a fist, and Ghent himself was
never that direct. As I said, Sara can come and go as she pleases - a
classic case of hiding in plain sight." <P>Frank stooped and picked up a handful of emeralds, letting them drop
slowly through his fingers. "We could just take the money and run." <P>"True." I placed my fingertips on the lattice, interfacing with the
neural net. "But why clean out the till when you can steal the entire
bank? Ghent may be gone but I can access the firmware femininity
protocols that he used as Sara. With these and my drugs I can morph into
a facsimile of her, one good enough to fool even Roth. Well, for as long
as it takes to dispose of him." <P>Frank grinned. "And what if he's shagging her? I'd love to see your face
if he starts cozying up in private." <P>"Trust you to think of that, but somehow I don't see Ghent canoodling
with the hired help." I sniffed. "Anyway, he's not my type." <P>"Oh yeah? Wait until you've put your chromosomes through the wringer,
then tell me you don't fancy a piece of rough like our man Arturo." <P>"Enough, already!" I walked around and slit Sara's blouse open. The head
of the eWurm had already emerged from her navel. "Biomass technology,
the cutting edge in living machinery. With this I can control the ship,
and everything in it, just like she did." <P>My companion-in-crime made a face. "Creepy. You really going to let that
thing inside you?" <P>I eased the interface free of the corpse and unbuttoned my waistcoat and
shirt. "Damn straight. It needs a living host to survive and is too
simplistic to support any concept of loyalty to Ghent." I held the eWurm
against my stomach and felt it start to burrow in. <P>Frank went pale and took a step back. Despite his propensity for
violence he can be quite squeamish at times. <P>The pain made me grimace but I kept talking, albeit through clenched
teeth. "I've run the financials. Ghent funds his lifestyle, the
Scaramanga, from the corporate 'Discretionary' account - it takes a
small percentage of the net profits from his investments. With Roth out
of the way I can steadily increase the percentage draw-down and the
automated accountancy routines will do the rest." <P>"Yeah, yeah - but how long will <i>that</i> take? Before we came aboard
it was
a case of you becoming this dude and cleaning him out in nothing flat.
Now we have to wait while you liquidise assets <i>and</i> off Roth as
well?
What happened to 'easy in, easy out', or is my memory playing tricks?" <P>The pain began to ease and I squared my shoulders. "Look, man, you've
got the attention span of a retarded goldfish. If I'd said this was
going to take weeks, maybe even months, would you have been interested
in the big picture? No, you wouldn't. Instead we'd be on our way out of
here with a fortune in our pockets and a price on our heads. Or do you
really think we can kill someone like Lucien Ghent and walk away
scot-free?" <P>Frank plucked at his bottom lip, a petulant gesture of his. "You were
the one who sliced him, her, whatever. He was willing to let us go." <P>I sneered at him. "Yeah, right. His type are all smiling bonhomie, right
up to the instant they start losing. We'd have walked off the ship into
a hail of gunfire, courtesy of Roth's little army." <P>"Still-" <P>"Still nothing. Look, this way I convert everything to bearer bonds and
then its Core systems, here we come. First-class all the way, no expense
spared." <P>He gestured to the wealth on display. "What about all this, then? We
just leave it behind?" <P>"Even if it's real I bet it's tagged in some way, traceable. Anyway,
it's just a drop in the bucket compared to what Ghent's investments are
worth." I tossed him my cane. "Now, I hate long goodbyes, so PISS OFF!" <P>Frank grinned, gave me the finger, and walked away. I called out after
him. "Hang on, you gonna' keep up the 'Frank' persona or what?" <P>"Not sure, but you can leave a message for me with Crank, he'll know who
you mean. See if you were my older brother, though, I'd have killed you
years ago." <P>"See if you were my younger brother, you'd never have been born." <P>He laughed and left the chamber. I sat down, feeling the ships systems
starting to impinge on my consciousness. It was strange, like standing
in a familiar room and realizing there were far more doors leading off
it than before. The housekeeping crawlers would dispose of the bodies
and clean the place up. I'd transition into Sara so that the next time
Roth came calling he'd be dead long before realizing anything was wrong.
Or maybe I'd dump Arturo in our vest-pocket Madeira and let him go
native, lord of all he surveyed. <P>I smiled and lifted a glass of champagne. All in all this was going to
be a very tasty world. <P>A very tasty world, indeed. <P> <P><small>&copy;Martin Clark 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
