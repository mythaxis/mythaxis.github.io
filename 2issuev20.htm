Williamson</i>
<p class=drop>&#147;He still looks crabby.&#148; </p> <P><p>&#147;Brawk from Research says that&#146;s one of his three natural
expressions: basically, preoccupied, sullen and unconvinced. According
to Brawk it&#146;s difficult to distinguish one from the others.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;These quizzicists are trained to be sceptical, I suppose.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;He usually avoids interviews. I wonder what made him agree to this
one.&#148;</p>						 
								 
<p>&#147;You mean apart from Tessany&#146;s charm and good looks?&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;And considerable skill. You have to admit she&#146;s damn good at her
job.&#148;</p>						 
								 
<p>&#147;I know. I see the ratings. She&#146;s irreplaceable.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;Let&#146;s hope she can get him to explain&#133; hang on, I think Twilene&#146;s
finished with him. We&#146;re about to go live.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>Twilene Moach from Cosmetics had indeed completed her emollient
ministrations and had </p>		 
								 
<p>packed away her array of brushes and powders, leaving her latest
subject looking, under her expert camouflage, unthreateningly stoical.
</p>							 
								 
<p>Tessany Flume flashed him a reassuring smile, and turned to the
quietly hovering camera.</p>	 
								 
<p>&#147;Hello again. Well, I hope you all enjoyed as much as I did those
nostalgic tales of the stage from Trafford Croles. I&#146;m Tessany Flume,
and I&#146;m delighted to introduce as my next guest this evening a
distinguished scientist, a quizzicist greatly respected by his peers,
but by the very nature of his work, perhaps less well-known to you at
home: Professor Sivid Padratheleon. Welcome, Professor, and thank you
for joining me on &#145;Tessa&#146;s Guests&#146;.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;Pleased to be here,&#148; murmured Padratheleon, as sincerely as his
temperament would allow.</p>	 
								 
<p>&#147;Now, a few background details for our viewers. You are currently the
Heliard Professor of Theoretical Quizzics at Platport University. And
your wife Preen, also a mathematician, has turned to sculpture&#133;?</p>
								 
<p>&#147;She constructs intersecting lattices, yes.&#148; </p>
								 
<p>The muscles around his mouth flexed into what may have been smile,
but it was not easy to tell whether he regarded this arcane pursuit with
secret pride, or even approval. </p>
								 
<p>&#147;And I believe your daughter is a choreographer?&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;She dances, yes.&#148;</p>		 
								 
<p>Sensing that he was growing impatient, Tessany Flume decided to move
on swiftly.</p>					 
								 
<p>&#147;I&#146;m told that you have formulated a theory which you say is of major
importance to our understanding of the universe.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;That is corrrect.&#148;</p>		 
								 
<p>&#147;And if I might paraphrase one of your colleagues, this theory is so&#133;
bold and innovative that it opens up a totally new area of science.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;Indeed so.&#148;</p>				 
								 
<p>&#147;Would it be possible, Professor, for the benefit of those of us less
familiar with advanced mathematics, for you to give us an insight into
your thinking, in terms that the general public might understand?&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;Probably not.&#148;</p>			 
								 
<p>&#147;But Pr...&#148;</p>				 
								 
<p>&#147;But I will try.&#148; The craggy face contrived to display tolerant
amusement, without conspicuous success. </p>
								 
<p>&#147;Quizzicists are concerned with the nature and properties of matter
and energy. Significant advances in our understanding occur as the
result of a process of continuous questioning, which of course is why
the subject is known as Quizzics. Keeping an open mind is not easy. It
is a facility too often lost after childhood, and particularly difficult
to recover once we have been indoctrinated with a traditionally
piecemeal system of knowledge. However, as a theoretician I have found
it more pertinent to question our basic assumptions, rather than
squabble over additions to a structure whose foundations we have only
assumed to be unshakable.&#148;</p>	 
								 
<p>Tessany Flume knew better than to interrupt a guest in full flow.</p>
								 
<p>&#147;There are limits to what we can observe, even though we have devised
increasingly sensitive instruments to extend the reach of our senses,
but mathematics provides us with tools that can transcend these limits,
exploring regions which would otherwise be inaccessible. I am speaking
here of the very stuff of which the universe is composed. My equations
indicate the existence of a set of unimaginably small.&#133; what for the
sake of simplicity I shall describe as particles, which bind and
permeate everything.&#148;</p>		 
								 
<p>&#147;That&#146;s extraordinary, Professor. You say <i>unimaginably small.</i>
Does that mean there would be no way of actually confirming the
existence of these.. <i>particles</i>, other than mathematically?&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;I am not an engineer. It may be possible in future to develop some
kind of sophisticated apparatus by means of which one or more of the set
of &#145;particles&#146; may be detected, most likely by inference, provided that
sufficiently controlled conditions could be achieved. They exist on a
scale and in a realm utterly invisible to us, ghostly presences
underpinning the whole of our reality. Of all fields of scientific study
I think this must qualify as the most fundamental.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;Then may I ask you, as the pioneer in this field, what we are to
call it?&#148;</p>					 
								 
<p>&#147;You may call it whatever you wish, Miss Flume.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>&#147;That&#146;s commendably modest of you, Professor, but surely such a major
advance deserves to be given a name by its discoverer.&#148;</p>
								 
<p>He frowned, considering the implications of letting others &#150; perhaps
ill-informed detractors, suggest something flippant or totally
inappropriate. The corners of Professor Padratheleon&#146;s mouth again
twitched imperceptibly.</p>		 
								 
<p>&#147;Well, until my conjectures can be verifed experimentally&#133;&#148;</p>
								 
<p>Padrathelion closed his eyes, focussing on the equations which drove
his haunting subatomic vision of an infinite seething field of what,
from a certain perspective, might seem to be intersecting lattices.</p>
								 
<p>&#147;I suppose it would have to be &#145;Phantom Quizzics&#146;.&#148;</p>
