description: "Mythaxis is not typically a home to poetry, nor to reprints, but when we came across this piece while hunting down the author of 'The Third Martian Dick Temple' we were immediately moved, in no small part due to the pandemic gripping the world in early 2020. One year on from the first Covid-19 lockdowns, the world remains profoundly changed from how it was before - but thankfully not this much changed."

## I



Follow me, children, Grandmother says,



Across concrete bridges strangled by vines\
Down deserted streets marked by meaningless lines\
Around the metal husks of cars\
Become the nests of beasts



We will stay away from the buildings\
Where only the dead reside\
Waiting on unpowered elevators\
That will never rise



To the shrine that stands in the midst of the city\
I will show you where our new beginning began



Grandfather grunts\
Tell them the truth this time, he says, not the pretty myth you made\
They deserve to know about—



I will tell it the only way they will understand, Grandmother says\
Too many words have been forgotten, and the parts I’ve left out\
Would mean nothing to them without a background in virology,\
Parasitology and applied microbiology



See? Look how confused the children are,\
Scratching their heads\
Science is dead\
You and I killed it\
Best tell them my myth instead



## II



Grandfather sees\
A squat white building with busted out windows\
And the skeletons of his former colleagues



The summer rains have come early\
And flooded the stairs



He sees it the way it once was\
Busy and alive



The stone globe in the courtyard\
Three rooster statues crowing\
One statue shattered by the bomb-throwing\
Terrorist that gave him his limp



This is the place, Grandmother says,\
The home of our ancestral tribe\
And when the sickness came to us\
We brought our babies here to die



See the moss-eaten rocks of vague avian shape\
Clutching water-smooth stones with their feet?\
This is where Lord Rooster was born\
And mistakes we must never repeat



Find a dry place to sit, now\
The tale is not long the way that I tell it



You tell it wrong, Grandfather thinks



## III



Grandmother’s Myth



When your grandfather and I were young\
Mankind had learned to fear\
The curses beasts could pass to us\
And their knowledge we held dear



Lord Rat was eldest bearer of these maladies\
A black shape skittering through our heads\
The fleas he carried with him\
Would bite us in our beds



And in eight days\
The bells would toll\
Announcing you were dead



Lord Cow was subtle for his size\
The madness he carried in his flesh\
Would pass to those who ate him,\
Even when his meat was fresh



And in a week\
The brain you had\
Would be a runny mess



Lord Monkey was a tricky one\
Plotting from his treetop throne\
His curse stripped away immunity\
So other sicknesses could grow



And without fail,\
The tamest colds\
Would strike us dead in droves



But it was Lord Rooster we feared the most\
For though his wings couldn't take him far\
The little birds he consorted with\
Were numerous as the stars



And when they sang\
At morning’s light\
Lungs seized and ceased to draw



No one could stop the spreading death\
When Lord Rooster walked the earth\
But your grandfather defeated him\
How? I will start with Rooster's birth—



## IV



Grandfather interrupts



They were viruses, you understand?\
The sniffles? The coughs?



He tries to find a way to explain\
Concepts that no longer exist



Small creatures, living things\
Invisible and discrete



Were they ghosts? the children ask



No, he says\
Lines of code in double helix



Do you remember when we\
Grafted the peach and the plum tree?\
When I cut a branch from the one and Inserted it\
Into the other’s cleft\
So we would have plums out of season?



Viruses are like that\
They are the scion,\
We are the stock



They graft themselves to us\
And together we bear fruit



The children stare up at him, baffled\
The littlest one asks if Lord Monkey was a tree



Grandfather tries to think of a better metaphor,\
Until he sees his wife’s smile



He sighs\
Just listen to Grandmother’s story, he says



And walks off a ways to sit alone\
Staring at the rooster statues\
Still crowing at the dead stone globe



## V



Ignore Grandfather, Grandmother says,



Look over there\
See where the rooster statues stand?\
This is where our elders sinned\
And gave their last command



They fought a war they could not win\
But so wicked were their ways\
They summoned up Lord Rooster\
And used him like a slave



They sent him to their enemies\
Without considering the cost\
For when their enemies lay dead\
Lord Rooster remained aloft



They built this shrine to summon him\
Trusting glass tubes to hold him in thrall\
Then brought their children as a sacrifice\
And laid them on his claws



Come to this place, sick spirit, they cried\
Voices rising above the wind\
Come drink your fill of our children\
We will pay in blood for our sin 



Then with their knives they plunged deep\
And reddened water from a bloody creek\
Rolled down the comb and wet the beak



Lord Rooster was born in a droplet—\
A bird thing, his mind gone thin



The statue cracked\
The droplet dropped\
The sickness took to wing



And In the dying dark of night\
Lord Rooster began to sing



## VI



Grandfather clears his throat



They were not children we made sick\
He says,\
Embryonic stem cells never lived\
An egg is not a chick



Our work was ordained\
Sanctioned from on high\
By government officials\
Who wished to never die



They told us to open the disease\
We unzipped it\
Read nature's code like data decrypted



Rewrote its essence to be useful\
And implanted our lie so well\
The human body swore that it was truthful



Listen to me, my grandchildren,\
Lord Rooster is nothing but the name\
We gave it when it jumped from birds to men\
The statue did not awaken\
We are not paying for our sin



## VII



Grandfather’s memory is going, Grandmother says,\
But I remember it rightly



The sun rising, the fluttering wings\
Shedding rock and debris to reveal\
A skinny raw thing\
With its mouth open wide\
And to it we villagers kneeled



We nourished him with blood until he grew strong



White and crimson feathers sprouted\
His granite beak took a yellow hue\
And when we pointed him towards the east\
To our enemies he flew



The littlest grandchild asks,



What do these words mean, Papa\
In the place where Lord Rooster once perched?



My company’s motto, Grandfather replies\
Our knowledge will light the Earth



How did you stop him grandpa?



Who?



Lord Rooster, the child says



Grandfather looks away\
With shame in his eyes\
He says, I did a bad thing 



No, Grandmother says,\
You saved so many lives



Tell the story how you wish, he says\
But leave me out of it



He turns and walks away\
Towards the ruined city



They will be safe without him\
On their return to the homestead\
A side effect of the cure:\
All the muggers are long dead



He perches himself on some rubble, brooding\
Mist rises from cracked streets like ghosts



The surest way to kill a virus\
Is to kill every possible host



Which he has done



It was easy and over fast\
Everything but the regret



He lapses into a long silence, thinking\
I am the reason there are no more birds 



Hours later, the sun rises over a dead city



Nothing crows
