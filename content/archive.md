***Mythaxis Magazine*** has been seeking out quality writing since 2008. We aim to provide a mixture of  speculative fiction in classic and contemporary styles, free from the typical web trappings of click-hungry advertising, and forever free to read.

Here you will find a place for science fiction both hard and soft, fantasy both high and low, horror both harsh and humorous, along with whatever mash-ups or sub-genres our contributors can conceive.
