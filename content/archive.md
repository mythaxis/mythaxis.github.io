## Archives

*Welcome to the Mythaxis Magazine Archive!*

Here you can find not only the more than one hundred-and-fifty pieces of fiction assembled by the magazine's founder, Gil Williamson, but we've also preserved the hand-coded format of the original zine as a lasting legacy of his varied talents.

*Mythaxis Magazine* has been seeking out quality writing for over a decade. We aim to provide a mixture of classic- and contemporary-styled speculative fiction, free from the typical web trappings of click-hungry advertising.

Here you will find a place for science fiction both hard and soft, fantasy both high and low, horror both harsh and humorous, along with whatever mash-ups or sub-genres can be conceived.

We pay our authors what we can, and offer their stories to you forever free-to-readâ€¦ enjoy!
