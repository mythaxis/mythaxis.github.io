Established in 2008 by Gil Williamson, *Mythaxis* began as a self-coded webzine with an unpredictable release schedule and a close-nit group of regular contributors. Edited by Andrew Leon Hudson since 2020, the magazine is now a clockwork-quarterly publication and welcomes new writers from around the world and shares their work in audio too! But some things never change: *Mythaxis* has always been focused on the fiction, with as little distraction as possible - no ads, no clutter, just quality stories to transport you somewhere else.

### Andrew Leon Hudson - *Editor*
Andrew is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing *Mythaxis* he has been published in a small handful of quality zines, and co-authored a serialised alternate history adventure novel. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesnâ€™t [do things online](https://linktr.ee/andrewleonhudson) often enough to count.

### Marty Steer - *Digital Huperson*
Marty is a human-like person who emerged from a Digital Humanities Research Hub at the School of Advanced Study. He likes messing about with humanities data, minimal computing and I also enjoy liminal ideas.

### Micah Hyatt - *the Voice of Mythaxis*

Micah is a veteran soldier, freight train conductor, and graduate of the Seton Hill *Writing Popular Fiction* MFA program. His fiction has been published all across the web, and his light-hearted zombie survival novella, *Eating the Exhibits*, is available through Amazon. He narrates and produces the audio-format of the Mythaxis stories.

### The Story Oracle - *Fictional Genius*
Blessed with guru-like serenity, the Story Oracle graciously bestows their wisdom on such editors as who climb to the peak of Slush Mountain and ask, *"Is this thing as good as I think it is?"* Occasionally, the answer is comprehensible.
