description: "***Mike Morgan*** *has lived on three continents. It wasn't for a bet; it was just how things worked out. (Being easily bored may have factored into it.) He's married with two kids and looks after a foul-tempered pet. Can you tell? His work has been included in anthologies like Flame Tree's* Gothic Fantasy; Science Fiction Short Stories, *NewCon Press's* Best of British Science Fiction 2018 *and* 2019, Unidentified Funny Objects 8, *and multiple issues of Hiraeth's* The Martian Wave. *His novella* Where the Monsters Are *is due out soon from Hiraeth. You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/culttvmike) and his [website](https://perpetualstateofmildpanic.wordpress.com/).*"
