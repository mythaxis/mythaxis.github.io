description: "***Lyra Meurer*** *has wanted to be a writer since they were a stream-wading, story-inventing child. Now they chase that dream in Colorado, where they live with their spouse, backyard skunks, and overflowing collections of journals and books. When they’re not writing, they can be found down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or basking in a sunbeam. Their short fiction can be found in* Trollbreath Magazine, Heartlines Spec, Cosmic Horror Monthly, *and several anthologies. Lyra's contemplations on international music, early 2000s television, worldbuilding, and other bizarre phenomena, along with pictures of their doodles, can be found at [their website](https://lyrameurer.blogspot.com/).*"
