description: "***Addison Smith*** (he/him) *is an amorphous being constructed of suspended cold brew and kombucha. His mind is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast formed around a brainstem of Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis fungus. He's doing his best, though. His fiction has appeared in dozens of publications including* Fantasy Magazine, Fireside Magazine, *and* Daily Science Fiction. *Addison is a member of the Codex Writers Group and you can find him on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/addi.social).*"
