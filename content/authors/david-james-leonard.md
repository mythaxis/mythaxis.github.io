description: "*A native of upstate New York,* ***Devin James Leonard*** *prefers the countryside over cities, and animals over humans. His favorite word is 'urchin', though he’s never used it in a sentence. When he isn’t writing or devouring books, he likes to make crop circles in random cornfields to entice the Men in Black. His published stories can be found on Instagram at [@devinjamesleonard](https://www.instagram.com/devinjamesleonard/).*"
