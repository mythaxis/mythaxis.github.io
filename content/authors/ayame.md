description: "***Ayame*** *settled in Kyoto, Japan, more than 10 years ago. The ancient town and its countless museums feed her love for history and art. Eternally curious, her latest obsessions often end up in her short stories. Ayame is a pseudonym, English her second language, and this her first published work of fiction.*"
