description: "***Pritesh Patil*** *(right) is fuelled by books, stories and coffee fumes. When he isn’t hunting monsters and searching for cracks between realities, he can be found deep in Dream's library spinning tales of hope and revolutions. You can find him on Twitter as [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/TheQuillseeker/).*

***Percy Wadiwala*** *(left) is a Chartered Accountant and MBA who quit his career as a Banker to spend more time with his cats. As his cats are much happier without his company, he engages in other pursuits including staring mournfully at broken glasses and, occasionally, writing. He lives in Mumbai with his family, his books, and a firm conviction that modern civilization is in terminal decline. Until that actually happens, however, you can read his scribbling and connect with him at [his website](https://www.slackerstales.com/), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/PercySlacker/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/slackerstales/). His first book, ‘The Day Money Died’, is available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B079V6NJ4K).*"
