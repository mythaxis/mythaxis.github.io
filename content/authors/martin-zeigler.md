description: "***Martin Zeigler*** *writes short fiction, primarily mystery, science fiction, and horror. His stories have been published in a number of anthologies and journals, both in print and online. Every so often (okay, twice) he has gathered these stories into a self-published collection. In 2015 he released *A Functional Man And Other Stories*. More recently, in 2020, a year we will all remember with fondness, he released *Hypochondria And Other Stories*. Besides writing, Marty enjoys the things most people do. And besides those, he likes reading, taking long walks, and dabbling on the piano. He makes his home in the Pacific Northwest.*"
