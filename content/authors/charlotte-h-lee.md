description: "***Charlotte H. Lee*** *spends her days pondering how best to smash all the boxes people want to keep the world in. It doesn’t matter whether it’s through telling stories to challenge others how we see life, or pushing herself to stretch her own brain in new ways. Her stories have appeared in* Little Blue Marble, Metaphorosis, The Overcast, *and others. You can find links to her published work at [www.charlottehlee.com](https://charlottehlee.com).*"
