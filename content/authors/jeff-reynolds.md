description: "***Jeff Reynolds*** *is a writer from Maryland who works for Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, home of New Horizons and Parker Solar Probe. He's only a software licensing analyst, though, and doesn't do any cool stuff like building space probes or meeting Brian Mays. Jeff's work has appeared in* Clarkesworld, Escape Pod, *and* Apparition Literary Magazine, *among others. You can find links to his work at [his website](https://www.trollbreath.com). If you want to find him, he's likely sitting at his desk day dreaming.*"
