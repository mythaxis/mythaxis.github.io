description: "***A.M. Sutter*** grew up in the beautiful mountains of Central Pennsylvania and has been fascinated with storytelling ever since she snuck downstairs as a child to watch* The Twilight Zone *with her father. She currently works as a zoo and exotic animal veterinarian, and the unique experiences in this field serve as inspiration for her writing. Her works appear in multiple anthologies and fiction magazines, and she is a member of the* Horror Writers Association. *Whenever she’s not arm-deep in tiger guts or elephant poop, she enjoys hiking with her Shih Tzu, who fully believes he is a wolf. Find her at [www.amsutter.com](http://amsutter.com/).*"
