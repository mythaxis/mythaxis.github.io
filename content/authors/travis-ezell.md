description: "***Travis Ezell*** *is a writer, linguist, and filmmaker located in Boston. He has worked as an educator at Emerson College and the Northwest Film Center in Portland, Oregon. His first publication was on human flesh (when a stranger got a tattoo of one of his tweets). He likes cheese, weird movies, his cat Spacecat, and midday naps. Right now he’s probably lost down a wiki-hole or buying more books than he can possibly read. Someone should probably stop him. Travis is currently a participant in GrubStreet’s Novel Incubator program, where his first book,* zMind, *is being revised.*"
