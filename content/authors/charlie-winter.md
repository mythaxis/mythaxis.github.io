description: "*Based in Australia,* ***Charlie Winter*** *is an academic by day and, by night, still an academic but more distractible about it. When not performing the inexplicable rituals of academia, he writes fantasy fiction celebrating everyday magic, eco-optimism, and queer identities. His publications include the* I Want That Twink Obliterated! *anthology and* Tales & Feathers *(upcoming). He can be found at [www.awinterplace.com](https://www.awinterplace.com/).*"
