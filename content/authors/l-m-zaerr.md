description: "***LM Zaerr*** *is a writer and medievalist. She wrote a book on medieval storytelling and sang forgotten tales to the raucous tones of the vielle. She lured students into medieval legends and abandoned them there to challenge dragons, rescue Lancelot, and figure out how to play* gwyddbwyll. *Now she finds new stories and transforms old ones. Her work has appeared in* Uncharted, Wyngraf, *and* New Myths, *among other venues. Visit her at* [www.lmzaerr.com](https://www.lmzaerr.com/)."
