description: "***Monte Remer*** *is a writer from the American west. He tells stories of strange happenings and macabre creatures, both unbecoming of the kind and simple hick that he is. Somewhere in the mountains, his aggressive typing on old keyboards can be heard as the dust rises out of them like smoke from a fresh fire.*"
