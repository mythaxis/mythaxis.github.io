description: "***Les Sklaroff*** *read science fiction from an early age, and though he's now old enough to know better the habit is hard to break. Born in London, educated at the University of Edinburgh, he worked for an antiquarian bookseller before teaching for ten years, then moved to the Isle of Wight and became an independent bookseller, specialising in Mervyn Peake, illustrated books, and modern first editions.*"
