description: "***Peter Wynd*** *is a Polish-based writer and living proof that AI’s randomness will never replace human imagination. In his free time he wonders whether he’s a metaphor. He loves traveling, designing board games, and writing at unexpected places. See more of his cat at* [www.peterwynd.com](http://www.peterwynd.com/)."
