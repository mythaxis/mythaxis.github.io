description: "***L Swartz*** (just L) *intrepidly exposes fairy tale apostates, misanthropic dragons, and shapeshifting ex-lovers from a messy desk overlooking Lazarus Island, which appears and disappears in the drowned river mouth of the Nehalem River as it pours its sorrows into the Pacific Ocean. Indoors, L harbors 1 badass queer partner of 25 years, 4 crime cats, 1 sweet old dog, and 1 screamy parrot. Outdoors, L unapologetically feeds every DGAF corvid and raccoon in the county.
