**As of 2021, *Mythaxis* will be published four times a year, and is periodically open to submissions within the following schedule:**

- **January 15th-31st**
- **April 15th-30th**
- **July 15th-31st**
- **October 15th-31st**

Submissions received outside of these dates will unfortunately be lost and therefore not responded to. When open, we seek and offer the following:

- **Length**: 1,000-7,500 words. This is a firm limit. Generally speaking, the further a story goes beyond 5,000 words the more it will need to impress, but the door is not shut in advance.
- **Compensation**: $20 on acceptance and return of contract. Payment via PayPal only.

We aim to acknowledge submissions the same day they are received. **If you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch**.

We aim to accept or reject within 14 days of that acknowledgment, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. **If you do not hear from us after 30 days, feel free to query**.

We require **First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity** from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies, in event of which an additional full payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the author.

**Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged**. Put your work out there, as many places as you can! We merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible. In the event that we accept first we would expect an positive confirmation, so we recommend sim-subbing to markets of equivalent status - we won't want to wait for someone else you'd like better to turn you down...

**We do not currently invite reprint submissions**.

**All submissions must be the original work of the author**. This is not a market for fan fiction.

We anticipate an adult readership in the sense of maturity, so reasonable depictions of violence, sexuality, philosophy, or bad language are acceptable. However, this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content, categorisation of which is at the editor's discretion.

**We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds**, be they cultural or personal, and submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences, provided they do not seek to attack or demean those of others.

We look forward to reading your work... but first:

 

### A friendly word of advice

It's important for authors to understand what they are giving up when they assign "first" publishing rights to a magazine. After we publish your story, you will only be able to offer it elsewhere as a **reprint**, which may mean you can only sell it for less money, or for free - and some markets don't accept reprints at all.

We want to publish great writing but our budget is modest, there are certainly better-paying markets out there. So why not try to land your masterpiece at the big markets first? Nothing ventured, nothing gained, after all - and when they prove themselves blind to your glory, we'll still be here to help you prove them wrong!

Okay, we've said our piece. If you're still keen to roll the dice...

 

### HOW TO SUBMIT

Email files as an attachment to:

**andrew**(dot)**leon**(dot)**hudson**(at)**gmail**(dot)**com**

Please use the email subject line **MYTHAXIS SUBMISSION – *STORY TITLE*** to evade spam filters.

Feel free to include a concise cover letter and/or author bio, though neither is mandatory. ***Mythaxis*** welcomes authors of all levels of experience. We have a history of publishing first-time authors, and we mean to continue this tradition.

 

### FORMATTING GUIDELINES

Acceptable document types are RTF, DOC, or DOCX.

Straightforward manuscript formatting is preferred for editorial convenience. We recommend using [Shunn's excellent Modern Manuscript formatting guide](https://www.shunn.net/format/story/), but in particular consider the following:

- Please use an easy-reading font (Times New Roman 12pt is preferred).
- Do not manually insert empty lines between paragraphs, or use tabs for first-line indents. **Use paragraph formatting** to set automatic indents or paragraph breaks.
- Use a single centred # to represent essential section breaks.
- Use *italics* for italics, don’t underline instead. Smart (“curly”) punctuation is fine.
- If your manuscript includes any unusual formatting, please alert the editors when submitting and have a really good, story-related reason.

 

### FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

If you would like to receive feedback on your story when we respond, please say so and we shall try to provide something constructive to consider. And if you absolutely do *not* want to receive feedback, telling us in advance is just fine too!

If you track your submissions, you can find ***Mythaxis Magazine*** on [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/Market?id=10939#).
