***Mythaxis* is currently closed to submissions.**

We are open to submissions within the following periods:

- **January 23rd-30th**
- **April 23rd-30th**
- **July 23rd-30th**
- **October 23rd-30th**

Submissions received outside of these dates will unfortunately be lost and therefore not responded to. When open, we seek and offer the following:

- **Length:** 1,000-5,000 words. These are *firm* limits. Shorter or longer works will be considered, but the further a story goes outside these bounds the more it will need to impress.
- **Compensation:** €0.01 per word, with a €20 minimum. Please be aware that payment is via PayPal only. 

If you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch. We aim to accept or reject within 14 days of acknowledgment, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. If you do not hear from us after 30 days, feel free to query.

### REQUIREMENTS

We acquire **First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity** from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies; in event of agreement, an additional payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the author.

**Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged.** Please tell us if you sim-sub, and we merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible. In the event that we accept first, we expect a positive and timely confirmation. Therefore we recommend sim-subbing to markets of equivalent status – we won't wait for someone else you'd like better to turn you down.

**We do not accept multiple submissions.** Please wait until your first submission has been rejected before submitting another work.

**If a story has previously been rejected by *Mythaxis*, please do not resubmit** or inquire regarding doing so, unless explicitly invited to by the editor during the original rejection.

> **Feedback:** Unfortunately, due to increased submission volume, it is no longer possible for us to offer feedback to all authors requesting it. This is a regretful necessity, but without the time required to say something meaningful feedback loses its value. We may, however, offer some comments when rejecting strong candidate pieces along with an invitation to revise and resubmit.
>
> If you absolutely do *not* want to receive feedback in the event of rejection, informing us during submission is absolutely acceptable.

**Reprints:** We do not currently invite reprint submissions.

**All submissions must be the original work of the author.** This is not a market for fan fiction. If your story is a retelling, pastiche, or homage to an existing work, please mention in your email the source you are alluding to.

**Content note:** We anticipate an adult readership in the sense of maturity, so reasonable depictions of violence, sexuality, philosophy, or bad language are acceptable. However, this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content, categorisation of which is at the editor's discretion.

**We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds** and invite submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences both cultural and personal, provided they do not seek to attack or demean those of others.

**Queries can be addressed to the editor at the email listed below.**

### HOW TO SUBMIT

* **NEW:** Access our shiny automated submissions form [here]().
* Email files as an attachment to: **MythaxisMagazine@gmail.com**

**File types:** Acceptable attachments are DOC, DOCX, and ODT (plus RTF, if you absolutely have to). **Do not submit in PDF format.**

Please use an email subject line like **MYTHAXIS SUBMISSION – YOUR STORY TITLE** to evade spam filters (and when we say *"your story title"*, we don't mean that literally…).

Feel free to include a concise cover letter and/or author bio in your email, though neither is mandatory. ***Mythaxis*** welcomes authors of all levels of experience. We have a history of publishing first-time authors, and we mean to continue this tradition.

If you track your submissions, you can find ***Mythaxis Magazine*** on [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/Market?id=10939#) and [Duotrope](https://duotrope.com/listing/10263/mythaxis-magazine).

## A NOTE ON "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"

**We do not invite submissions featuring prose created by generative "artificial intelligence", algorithmic systems, large language models, or similar tools.** 

We recognise the importance of authorial ownership when it comes to an individual's rights. The questionable provenance of AI-derived content, and the uncertain legality of claiming "authorship" of the output of AI tools, means that knowingly signing a contract of sale for an AI-generated submission would be inappropriate. We hope that submitting authors will respect our position.

In the past, ***Mythaxis*** has experimented with generative image tools and used data analytics to investigate the nature of the stories submitted to us. We documented these experiences in a number of editorials (see Issue [28](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-28/editorial.html) for art, Issues [31](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-31/editorial.html), [32](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html), and [33](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-32/editorial.html) for data analysis, plus our final round up [here](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-34/artificial-artificial-intelligence.html)). All data analysed was always fully anonymised and never employed tools capable of producing derivative creative works.
