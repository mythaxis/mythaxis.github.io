description: "Bringing both our issue and the year to a resounding close, it is the editor’s pleasure to introduce a number more crime stories published elsewhere in 2024 to the reader’s attention. So, if the six tales you’ve found here have but whet your appetite, let’s make it an even dozen with four firm recommendations and a couple of not-bads!"
