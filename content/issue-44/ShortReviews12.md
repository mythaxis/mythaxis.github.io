{{<glyph>}}I{{</glyph>}} usually go for recommendations at three publications in these end of year roundups, but since I'm going to hit you with a cluster o

{{<glyph>}}B{{</glyph>}}oth of our previous annual crime review roundups have included stories from *[TOUGH](https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/)* from Redneck Press, but this may be the last time that happens as, communicated via a cut-to-the-chase post at the start of September thanking past contributors, the zine is now on indefinite hiatus, bringing to an end eight years of operations. If I'm being honest, as a reader I found its offerings a mixed bag, though there were some good tales in there for sure. To which point, three stood out for me over its final nine months.

**[Keeper](https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/05/keeper-fiction-by-scott-blackburn.html)** by Scott Blackburn slips us into lives sunk to the bottom but (mostly) determined to pull themselves up to see better days, and shines a light on the good, and bad, choices that determination may inspire in moments of looming crisis. The musically motivated **[Shriek of the Week](https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/04/shriek-of-week-fiction-nick-mamatas.html)** by Nick Mamatas feels increasingly irreal, drifting almost dreamily alongside a disfigured dropout with a head full of school-shooting buckshot that picks up metal airplay from local radio stations, tormented by conspiracies of corrupt COVID cops in a locked-down NYC. But my favourite was probably Vinnie Hansen's **[Justice Served](https://redneck-press.blogspot.com/2025/03/justice-served-fiction-by-vinnie-hansen.html)**, a San Diego acid-trip to SeaWorld that's actually (or rather *also*) a private eye yarn in a fairly classic vein: there's a brutal mystery to be explored and explained, by a social outsider with a nose for information and a smoking hot blonde for a client.

It's always a shame when a publication closes its doors, but the short genre fic business is very much this one's namesake: *tough*.

{{<glyph>}}M{{</glyph>}}y final recommendation is more like a case of *first amongst equals*, as out of the five stories which have to date appeared in *[Cold Caller](https://coldcallermag.substack.com/)*, a new crime zine platformed on Substack, four struck me as more or less equally interesting reads. I won't link them all, there's few enough to sift through, and while I could as easily have gone for **Strangers**, **Used to Be Some Kind of Badass**, or **When Things Get a Little Western**, the one I'll mention in particular is Colleen Quinn's **[Calamity Creek](https://coldcallermag.substack.com/p/calamity-creek)**.

What begins as reminiscences about that type of faintly notorious local kid you used to distantly know growing up segues into a glimpse of a community's dirty little open secret, evoking a character-filled corner of small town USA which crams remarkable breadth and depth into it's tight, brief runtime. I really enjoyed the writing in **Calamity Creek**, the personalities and situations past and present all rang true, and I could happily have kept reading beyond where it came to a halt. On the other hand, they do say *Always leave them wanting more*.

The four stories I named are all very different and I enjoyed them in different ways, but I'll make an observation verging on critique: in each case, I felt that the story's end was not its strongest feature. The fifth piece, *The Man Who Hated Dogs*, which was certainly not bad, did strike me as a somewhat more "complete" narrative, though for me it also signposted itself way too clearly, right from that title. Nevertheless, on the strength of what they have published so far I'll certainly keep an eye on *Cold Caller* in the future.
