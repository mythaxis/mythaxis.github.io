In case you hadn't noticed, we're undergoing something of a transformation here at ***Mythaxis***.

Our Spring issue coincided with the podcasting at *Upbeat Tales* of Emma Burnett's *Friends in High Places*, and subsequently one of our other contributors, **Micah Hyatt**, reached out with an audio version of his story, *[Nightshade Memory](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-37/nightshade-memory.html)*, and asked if we'd like to platform it directly. We tried not to snatch it from his hand too eagerly, and you can hear it at the link right now.

But don't click too quickly. In the conversation around making that happen, we learned that Micah had narrated and produced the recording in a home studio he'd set up himself – impressive – and upon our shamelessly asking whether he'd also like to do audio versions of all our stories we were equal parts surprised and delighted when he immediately said, "Yes." Since then he's been busy recording the accompaniments for Issue 38, [the first of which is live right now](https://mythaxis.co.uk/issue-38/interlocking-grains-of-light.html), with more to follow on a weekly basis.

We were planning to include a short interview with Micah in this editorial, but it turned out to be far too interesting to be buried in here, so instead you can find it closing out the issue alongside the stories he'll be progressively giving voice to. Therefore, let's cut this one short – there's more than enough going on in the magazine itself this quarter.

Until next time, happy reading… and listening!
