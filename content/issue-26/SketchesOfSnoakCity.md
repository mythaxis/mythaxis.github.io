description: "Back in 2012, Les Sklaroff had already been contributing quirky pieces to Mythaxis for several years. Issue 11 introduced us to a variety of unusually named persons — Paeony 3rdfield, Dundro Fappit, a collection of rivals negotiating the maze of someone called 'Foroquont' — all denizens of a single, strange, intriguing city, possibly ancient, possibly future. Over the following eight years we've returned to Snoak City numerous times, but the connections between these moments has never been as clear as now."

**Editor's note**: a change from our normal fare this time! 

While in years gone by Les Sklaroff's excursions have come to us one by one, we've now created a dedicated home for them all, creating a sort of guidebook in the process.  Connections between the people and places that make up this unusual metropolis were hard to spot when spread out across years, but now they (and the rich language that renders them) can be found side by side on the page, conveniently bound for the traveller's benefit.

In real life, Les was a long-time friend of ***Mythaxis***' dearly departed creator Gil Williamson. While the individual stories are still in place across our archive of back issues, I'm sure Gil would be happy to see them compiled and complementing each other as they now are. And this *Who's Who* and *Where's Where* is far from completed—in future editions, the sketches boasted of on that cover will be more than merely figurative…

In the meantime, if you'd like a personal tour of the strangest corners a strange place has to offer, we invite you to peruse:
