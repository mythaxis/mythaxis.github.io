While casting about for a subject for this issue's editorial, a friend proposed the topic *"Why I think writing an editorial for my incredible magazine whose quality fiction speaks for itself is more important than writing my own incredible fiction"*. They went on to observe that, *seriously, editorials are boring and pointless*, asserting that *nobody reads them* (dissenters to this claim being a statistical anomoly, likely akin to the one suggesting that there is intelligent life in the universe), before wrapping up their position with a concrete suggestion for the editorial's full content:

> What are you doing reading this bit? Go on, shoo! Go read the stories! Go on, get out of here! Shoo!
> Signed, the Editor

The problem is, once you start down the write-an-editorial path, it's hard to get off it again. I mean, the tab's right there in our masthead banner options thingie, it'd be silly to waste it. Plus I need a place to thank our cover artists for their generosity, can't skip that (on which subject see below why not). There's not a lot we can do without completely overhauling the magazine's whole design really, is ther—

…oh. *Hmm.* Now there's a thought.

Because it has occurred to me, as I've worked on this year's issues, that ***Mythaxis*** and myself approach a little milestone. Although Gil Williamson comfortably remains our longest-serving editor, founding the magazine in 2008 and helming it for exactly a decade, it was always published on a when-the-urge-took-him schedule. When he handed me the reins (an act that has genuinely changed my life!) I decided to aim for regularity instead. As a result, as of today, I have overseen more issues than Gil did. By one. Come the end of 2025, by two.

These two eras of ***Mythaxis*** history have basically presented different faces to the world (as you can see for yourself if you check out the **Back Issues** and **The Original Archive** on our [Archive page](https://mythaxis.co.uk/archive.html)). Therefore, why not launch our first issue of 2026 with another new look? Why not commission a new logo? Why not a whole host of them? 

I think I shall!

Anyway, what are you doing reading this bit? Go on, shoo! Go read the stories!

Go on, get out of here!

Shoo!

### Signed,
