The ***Mythaxis Magazine*** catalogue is your one-stop shop for all content listings, by title, author name, category, and genres. [The data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mythaxis/mythaxis.github.io/master/data/xway2metadata.json) is distributed in a variety of formats [and a variety of temporal chunks](https://github.com/mythaxis/mythaxis.github.io/blob/master/content/archive.md) (because AI will do your work for you). Or use [the original format](https://mythaxis.wordpress.com/mythaxis-magazine/) of a list of plain old alphabetised table rows, or a [sitemap for a singular www source](./sitemap.xml).
