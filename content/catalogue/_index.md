The mythaxis magazine catalogue is your one stop page for all content listings, [by title, issue, date, author](https://github.com/mythaxis/mythaxis.github.io/blob/author-index/data/xway2-metadata.json), [genre, topic or category](https://github.com/mythaxis/mythaxis.github.io/blob/master/content/archive.md) (because AI will do your work for you). Or use [the original format](https://mythaxis.wordpress.com/mythaxis-magazine/) of a list of plain old alphabetised table rows.
