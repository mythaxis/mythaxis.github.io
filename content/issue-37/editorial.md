We'd like to salute the talented artist responsible for our cover image, **AstroCats**: [Michal Kváč](https://linktr.ee/kvacm), a freelance environment concept artist and illustrator from Czech Republic. Click that link to check out his work or make contact (or you could click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlCzFe8E3Dg) to see a time-lapse video of him in action – quite a long watch, but interesting to skip through at least). Many thanks, Michal!"
