<p>Established in 2008 by Gil Williamson, <em>Mythaxis</em> has always been focused on the fiction, with as little distraction as possible - no ads, no clutter, just words on the page to transport you somewhere else.</p>

<p>You can follow <em>Mythaxis</em> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MythaxisMagazine">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mythaxis">Twitter</a>, and to receive each new issue's Table of Contents in your inbox, you can sign up at editor Andrew Leon Hudson's very infrequent and utterly non-spammy <a href="https://j.mp/ALH-MailingList">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><em>Mythaxis</em> is forever free-to-read, but if you would like to support the magazine <a href="https://ko-fi.com/mythaxismagazine/">you could always buy us a coffee</a>.</p>

<h3>Andrew Leon Hudson - <em>Editor</em></h3>
<p>Andrew is a technical writer by day, and is technically a writer by night as well. In addition to editing <em>Mythaxis</em> he also creates the story art, using of rights-free images provided by too many generous people to mention here - check after the stories. He lives in Barcelona, Spain, and doesnâ€™t update <a href="https://andrewleonhudson.wordpress.com/">his website</a> or use <a href="https://twitter.com/AndLeoHud">twitter</a> very often.</p>

<h3>Marty Steer - <em>Digital Huperson</em></h3>
<p>Marty is a human-like person from a Digital Humanities Research Hub at the School of Advanced Study. He likes messing about with humanities data, minimal computing and I also enjoy liminal ideas.</p>

<h3>The Story Oracle, atop Slush Mountain</h3>
<p>Blessed with guru-like serenity, the Story Oracle graciously bestows their wisdom on such editors who climb to the appropriate peak and ask, "Is this thing as good as I think it is?" Occasionally, the answer is comprehensible.</p>
