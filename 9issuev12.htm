<div><i>Hey! Let's be careful out there!</i>
<p class="drop">Jack Newman shouldered past the six-inch
reinforced alloy frame of the self-driving armored personnel carrier
into SoMa town, San Francisco, shards of glass and crumbling asphalt
crunching beneath his tactical boots like the rib cages of small
mammals. He squinted through mean wind that tasted of burning batteries,
to take in the broken majesty of AT&amp;T park. Half of the Giants
Stadium had collapsed like some 20th century rendition of the Roman
Colosseum, its steel bones digested by the stomach acid of Pacific sea
salt and the floor-by-floor demolition of state budgets. The more
obscure consumption of the United States by its financial &eacute;lite,
that infestation of white-shoed tapeworms who devoured all legitimate
business, all productivity, leaving nothing but stinking piles of
economic feces and fraudulent bank paper where metropoli once boomed.
The Bay itself had gone the color of bile, the ocean heaving nauseous
from a trillion tons of anthropocentric carbon, vomiting itself across
South Beach Harbor parking lot and playground, washing wrecked yachts
across the highway against bent street signs and abandoned cars and the
dark windowless husks of skyscrapers.  Shoals of trash and untreated
sewage festered and smothered whatever remained of the coastal
ecosystem.  The bodies of poisoned fish, seals and whales were left to
rot, the fly-ridden flesh thin and grey
and everywhere, like black and white photographs of Nazi camp
mass-graves. <P>It&#146;d been ages since Jack had actually seen un-mediated, unpolished
urban decay in meatspace, let alone actually had to wallow in it, and it
made his skin crawl with a kind of ambient tension and Rousseau-esque
guilt. It made his head hurt more to think about what it meant that he
felt such revulsion toward reality. Visions of the Agent Smith-Morpheus
showdown asserted themselves like popup ads into his mind&#146;s eye. <P>&quot;I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever
you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if
there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink
and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.&quot;
The smell, that&#146;s what it was. The smell of burning ash and rotting
garbage and dead mammals. All of these un-targeted,
un-personalized stimuli, all this terrible &#145;serendipity&#146;, this
unprogrammed experience. It was viscerally repulsive to Jack. He closed
his eyes, nudged the microprocessors in his corneas awake with a
three-thought Ideocode sequence -- visualising his mother's face, the
melody to All Along The Watchtower, and the memory of his first
successful assassination with a humanoid drone. He clicked his heels
together for good measure.  An Encephalock reader membraned over the
tissue of his cerebral cortex, scanned the chain of neural firings in his
brain, unlocking a transparent cerulean HUD of timestamp, taskbar, and
compass that crept into his peripheral vision.  With a wink at a virtual
tab, Jack papered over the sight of disgusting reality with the clinical
rectilinearity of his AR-overlayed email inbox. He felt instantly
better.  Even if it was a wall of X-Pandgen penis enargement
gene-therapy spam and messages from his wife hounding him over some
birthday party planning he couldn't be bothered with.  Even the
ubiquitous marquee ads for depleted uranium flechette pistols that kept
chasing him across the net were a comfort as they scrolled over the
tangled snarl of a sixteen car pile-up in South Beach playground.  No
place like home. <P>It was unusual, to say the least. The heavy brass had called Jack and
his team of Troubleshooters out of the bunker arcology down into San
Fran, demanding in-person oversight of the investigation. That never
happened, especially not beyond the Ameribank City barrier. RPLCNTS and
air drones were teleoperated in the field from climate-controlled
C&amp;C hubs, or programmed for autonomous detective-mode as the primary
means of on-the-ground actual police work. That was the CyberSec M.O. If
human beings were called out of the green zone into the battlefield, it
meant someone very high up was personally pulling strings. Strings such
as the fat end-of-the-year bonus that had suddenly appeared in Jack&#146;s
bank account, one which his immediate supervisor would never authorize,
not even for cluster-bombing an abandoned Costco full of World Class War
jobless insurgents. Not that Jack had an argument with the money, per
se. <P>A Valkyrie drone transport was crouching near the crime scene.
The Emergency medical drones had made it in time to stop the bleeding but
the kid had slipped into a coma, and all the king&#146;s nanites couldn&#146;t put
his prefrontal cortex back together again. Multiple cerebral contusions,
face smashed unrecognizable- Jack hadn&#146;t seen that kind of gutty gore
since the Compton prison guard robots went AWOL from a bad firmware
update, pounded the inmates&#146; skulls into corned beef with fire
extinguishers. That incident had been a bitch to cover up. It took the
cleaners six hours to scrub the goopy chunks of brain and hemoglobin
from the cell walls and bars. The cover story about a facility-wide
prisoner revolt had been a stretch, but necessary to ward off all the
Human Rights and Anti-Robot organization limpdicks salivating at the
chance to score political points against the big-box automated prison
industry. Jack had pulled multiple Red Bull-powered all-nighters taking
down whistleblower blogs and humanitarian sites using DDoS hacking
attacks, shouting down activists in forums and chatrooms with an army of
AI-run counter-poster accounts. Jack nipped all attempts to expose the
incident in the bud. The spin team CGed black faces onto all the
released security footage; the undying fear of the angry black man could
always be counted on to sway public opinion in a pinch. <P>But this wasn&#146;t an airbrush job for the corporate Elite; for the first
time in months, Jack was actually being asked to solve an
honest-to-Gnossis crime. <P>&quot;I&#146;m feeling like a real police officer, I think I need to up my
dosage,&quot; Jack bantered into his mic. <P>&quot;Book &#146;em, Dano.&quot; Stasia laughed back, exiting the vehicle
beside Jack, ballistic leather-analog creaking as she slapped him on the
shoulder. <P>&quot;The boy, one Justin Diamond. Stable condition. Son of Alistair and
Margaret Diamond, Divorced. Father is a senior executive at Vitanet
Medical. Former governer of New Hampshire and New Jersey. On the board
of the American Medical Association. Duck-hunting buddy of President
Vanderlyle&#146;s old man.&quot; <P>&quot;Vitanet? Jesus. That explains, well, everything. Of course the
trillionaires can afford to buy their own personal investigation into
their son&#146;s near-murder.&quot; <P>Jack pulled up the boy&#146;s files into an unused section of retina real
estate, thankful for the overlay&#146;s breakup of the real-world overload.
The brick and mortar was starting to grate on his eyeballs. <P>&quot;Last connectivity, today, 9:34 AM. Via a dVice Ubiq.&quot; Jack
fiddled through the kid&#146;s pockets, coming up with only lint and
date-rape pills. <P>&quot;No dVice on him. Looks like someone out there is running around
with stolen hardware. Let&#146;s run it by the registries.&quot; <P>Jack examined the area surrounding the chalked outline, stepping over
the metal column of a fallen street lamp, fluted green metal blistering
with rust. There was another dead body, thirty feet away. A spider
crawled over to the mess, scanned the face and took a DNA sample. A tiny
hooked implement like a dentist&#146;s scraper ejected from the forensic
bot&#146;s mandibular area. It used the scraper to extract a dollop from the
pool of blood beneath the corpse&#146; head. The blood had congealed
in a pothole like strawberry Jell-O. <P>The results for the second victim were instantaneous, and the dossier
tabbed itself like a playing card beside the primary&#146;s file. <P>&quot;Amit Garcia. Ex-accountant. Former Ameribank City citizen till a
few months ago when his citizenship was revoked due to consecutive
delinquent payments.&quot; <P>&quot;Double homicide? Or a separate incident?&quot; Stasia hypothesized. <P>&quot;Maybe. Hard to say. It&#146;s dangerous, chaotic out here in the Bay
Area. Life expectancy rates aren&#146;t so great.&quot; <P>&quot;Chaotic? Aren&#146;t we going to at least look into it?&quot; <P>&quot;He had his citizenship taken away for failing to make payments.
That means this guy&#146;s a Deadweight. An Unemployed. He doesn&#146;t count as a
person as far as we&#146;re concerned.&quot; Jack pointed to Amit&#146;s former
white collar office shirt, turned grey from living in the street, as if it
was QED. <P>&quot;As far as we&#146;re concerned? So we&#146;re going to look the other way?&quot; <P>&quot;As far as our bosses are concerned. We&#146;re not being paid to
investigate deaths of unimportant individuals.&quot; <P>Stasia performed a Premium Internet search with Amit&#146;s facial biometrics. <P>&quot;Look, there&#146;s a video of Amit and some other jobless San
Franciscan tearing at each other&#146;s throats. A human dogfight. It&#146;s got
fifty thousand hits on the &#145;Tube and is circulating semi-viral on
Friendbook. It looks like Justin here wasn&#146;t exactly innocent.&quot;
Stasia held the jittery clip up in Jack&#146;s face. Jack feigned
incredulity. <P>&quot;We don&#146;t know that. It could&#146;ve been anyone filming the
brawl.&quot; Jack said. <P>&quot;&#146;San Fran Food Fite to Teh Deth&#146;, uploaded 9:34 AM today by
Darkshado, registered name: Justin Diamond.&quot; Stasia held up the
streaming video of the soon-to-be-dead Amit having his head crushed
against the point of a fire hydrant by another unemployed Deadweight
bum. A cracking teen voice laughed and wagged a bag of fast food at the
starving Deadweights, egging them into killing one another in sick
gladiatorial fashion. <P>&quot;It&#146;s just high schoolers being stupid high schoolers, that&#146;s what
they do. Things got out of hand.&quot; Jack brushed the video aside. <P>&quot;Jesus, somebody is dead, Jack! And this rich little silver spoon
brat was directly responsible. We have to do something.&quot; <P>Jack sighed, pulled an Altoid tin from the inner pocket of his
double-breasted trenchcoat, one of the few pieces of dumbware he kept on
him for sentimental value. <P>&quot;I said I feel like a police officer, Stas. But that&#146;s not what we
are. Police don&#146;t exist anymore. We&#146;re Troubleshooters. Sooner or later
you&#146;re going to learn what that means.&quot; He offered her one of the
flat white cylinders. She turned away. <P>Jack waved away the autotriage, which beeped subserviently. Attached by
braided wires, a blood pressure monitor self-strapped itself to the arm
of the brutalized teen&#146;s unconscious body as the self-driving stretcher
wheeled up into the loading bay of the awaiting Valkyrie drone. Jack
sheltered his eyes as the drone&#146;s four swimming-pool-sized rotors spun
up, blowing a typhoon of dirt and trash up from the San Fran sidewalk.
En route back to Ameribank City, polished crystalline skyline shuddering
through the grimy atmosphere like a hallucination. To Justin Diamond&#146;s
mega-rich parents, soon to be devastated mega-rich parents, then
vindictive mega-rich parents. A very dangerous combination. <P>&quot;Look, I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m tired and this unpurified air is bad for my
asthma. Let&#146;s just get through this, yeah?&quot; Jack touched Stasia&#146;s
back. The smell of her apple cider washed hair was a refreshing oasis in
the blunt reek of the necropolis. Her frazzled business-punk do made her
seem younger than she already was. <P>&quot;Yeah. Maybe I&#146;ll let you buy me a drink, explain to me the dark
riveting history of how you became such an asshole.&quot; She took the
piss out, batting Jack in the head as she ran through juxtaposed charts
of either victim&#146;s vitals, intersections of their social graphs, teasing
out potential connections. She was fetchingly smart, impossibly
passionate, a fireball, a shooting star, and she reminded Jack so much
of himself, of his wife, twenty years ago, before he&#146;d burned all his
na&iuml;ve idealism out in the suffocating atmosphere of the hardball,
neo-feudal world. Which might&#146;ve been why he&#146;d given into the nepotism
and pulled strings to make sure Stasia survived whenever the monthly
Layoff Games came around and management looked for more &quot;fat&quot;
to be trimmed from the already bleeding bone, to be fed to robots and
automation. Nothing unforgivable had happened yet between them, but Jack
wondered if there would be anything to forgive, given that his marriage
had deteriorated precariously close to emotional bankruptcy. The thought
would be a useful talisman against guilt if anything did happen, Jack
mentally noted. <P>Concentric yellow semicircles surrounding an antiquated phone symbol
radiated from the corner of Jack&#146;s eye. Not a text, not a voicechat, an
honest-to-Gnossis telephonic request. It was his wife, he knew,
before even glancing at the caller ID. <P>&quot;Hold on, Joy&#146;s on the line. Need to take this,&quot; Jack said.
Stasia didn&#146;t frown, but Jack could tell she was trying not to. With her
light freckles and turned-up nose it made her look sad but also achingly
cute, and Jack looked away. He walked back to the APC, tapped the
blinking face of his wife, initiating the voice convo, steeled up his
nerves. <P>&quot;Hey.&quot; <P>&quot;What the hell is your problem?&quot; <P>&quot;What?&quot; <P>&quot;Jesus, Jack, again? Really? You forgot again? I&#146;ve already put the
kids to bed. We had to run to Bake Boss to pick up the birthday cake. I
told you I needed eggs for the recipe, and I know you got the message.
I know because I&#146;m looking at the confirmation email that I added the
wall note into your Life Planner, which is the only thing you ever
check.&quot; Jack had indeed accidentally-on-purpose dragged the message
to the trashcan, but he&#146;d already blocked the incident out of his memory
so well that he almost convinced himself he hadn&#146;t. <P>&quot;Well, honey, maybe if you didn&#146;t let the cat get into the chicken
coop, you&#146;d have- Look, I know you&#146;re really on this urban farming kick,
but not everyone is meant to be an Amish hippy and raise their own
food.&quot; <P>&quot;No. You can&#146;t make this about me. If you&#146;re going to miss your
daughter&#146;s birthday party, again, at least have the goddamn decency to
own up to it.&quot; <P>&quot;That&#146;s not fair. You know I&#146;m out here working my ass off just so
she can <b>have</b> cakes and parties and running water. They laid off
another two Troubleshooters today, replaced &#146;em with the new Mach 9s.
Citizenship fees are up 10% from last month and we&#146;re an inch from
slipping underwater on the mortgage. You know that? Of course not.
Because I do all the worrying in this family. Me. The cross is all on my
fucking shoulders.&quot; <P>&quot;That&#146;s because you never tell me anything, asshole. I have to
crawl my way up the ladder through your friends, co-workers and boss just
to get a dead-end number that you never answer. And then I reach you,
and it&#146;s just some chatbot-encapsulated version of you that I&#146;m supposed
to &#145;relate with&#146;? What, you need machines to live your life for you too,
now? God, sometimes I feel like I&#146;m married to a drone.&quot; <P>&quot;Look, I can&#146;t deal with this right now, I&#146;m working. I&#146;ll be home
later. Sometime.&quot; <P>&quot;Fine. Bye.&quot; Jack hung up, recomposed himself. Thought of
solving Rubik&#146;s cubes and Stasia&#146;s hair. <P>&quot;Everything ok?&quot; Stasia asked. Jack just waggled his head
ambiguously, like a Mumbai Taxi Driver. <P>&quot;Let&#146;s just get this done.&quot; <P>As Jack wandered over to some of the nearby crumbling apartments, he saw
that women in hennaed head wraps and hand-dyed, quilted hemp fleece
sarongs were out, hanging clothes up to dry. They joked, laughing over
some small talk as if to spite the withering collapse surrounding them.
The clothes lines of reclaimed, unbraided telephone wire were strung
across the branches of young dogwood trees, cracking their way through
the sidewalk strips. Without illegal-immigrant landscapers paid to keep
hedges and shrubbery suppressed in fashionable rectilinear shapes,
nature had begun to redeem the prodigal urbanity. <P>A father in his early twenties and his waist-high daughter climbed a
ladder made of welded park railings canted against a row of shipping
containers, gathering rust and moss in the street like the lost luggage
of a civilization&#146;s cancelled flight. The containers had most likely
been helicoptered across King Street as barricades during battles
between anti-austerity insurgents and the corporate militaries, left to
sit for years. Atop the industrial metal prisms were planted rooftop
gardens, which the father and daughter tended. The girl scuttled about,
gathering Thai basil, tomatoes, bok choi, sweet lettuce while the father
adjusted settings on a notebook computer, rainproofed with a modified
Gap raincoat. The decade-obsolete paleoware bloomed with recycled
hardware components. Cables, temperature, humidity, and pH sensors,
automatic watering apparatus, monitoring cameras, all wired into an
ecological nervous system, the brain of some sort of self-regulating
aquaponic setup. The man illustrated for the girl how to select ripe
Polynesian taro, cutting the stem an inch above the soft earth, pulling
the corm, replanting the cutting, renewing the cycle. Some fleeting
memory of a &#145;high tech-high-touch&#146; lecture from an eternally
Birkenstocked professor surfaced in Jack&#146;s mind then descended as
quickly. The man was patient, so patient, as the girl accidentally cut
too close to the heart-shaped leaves, spoiling several harvestings. He
demonstrated again and again till she got it right, and Jack thought of
himself lobbing ten-second canned explanations of trigonometric
functions to his daughter&#146;s eager requests for math homework help, and
he felt a hot burning in his face like contempt but he knew not of what.
On arrival, Jack had been too caught up in the urban decay of the
necropolis to notice, but upon closer inspection, one could see that
many of the balconies of nearby uncollapsed apartments were adorned with
similar vertical gardens, solar cells popping up like mushrooms from a
dead log. Green shoots of self-sustainable life sprouting from the ash
of the forest FIRE. The economy of Finance Insurance and Real Estate. <P>The women froze like deer when they saw Jack and his fellow CyberSec
Troubleshooters, the dreadlocked man in the container-top garden
grabbing his daughter&#146;s arm, pulling her in close. Jack approached them,
cautiously, but not so much so as to suggest a defensive stance. <P>&quot;Hi. Nice weather we&#146;re having,&quot; Jack said, regretting the
joke in poor taste, choking on the Beijing-flavored swamp passing as
atmosphere. <P>&quot;Take your Tin Men and leave, Wraith. We have done nothing
wrong,&quot; said the gardener. <P>&quot;We mean you no harm, just want to ask you a few questions. I like
what you&#146;ve done with the place.&quot; <P>&quot;How can we trust your serpent tongue? You are the harbinger of
pain and death,&quot; the gardener said, pointing a gnarled wand of
olive branch at Jack, as if the immutable magic of peace and love might
vanquish or at least ward off &quot;The Corporatist State&quot; or
whatever hegemonic evil these neo-hippies saw when they perceived
Troubleshooters. The man climbed down off the shipping container, lifting
his daughter before she reached the rung fourth from the pavement,
though she protested. <P>&quot;Look, I don&#146;t want to be here any more than you want me to be
here,&quot; Jack said, changing strategy to appeal to mutually assured
beneficence. &quot;I&#146;m Jack.&quot; Jack stretched out his hand. A gull
shrieked, plummeted into the bay, dead of some new, unnamed and
unforeseen ecological calamity. <P>&quot;East,&quot; said the dreadlocked leader of the &#145;cargo cult&#146;. <P>&quot;Have you seen this boy around? This morning perhaps?&quot; Jack
said, offering a picture. Jack tried to gauge the man&#146;s reaction as he
examined the digital portrait. Jack&#146;s Oracles read the man&#146;s facial
expression, ultrasonics detected his heart rate, crunched the biometrics
in a kind of distance-polygraph. <P>&quot;No, I haven&#146;t. He looks like one of the Bent Ones, not from our
community,&quot; the man named East said. The Oracles completed their
analysis. Probability of truth: 62%. Unreassuring. Jack didn&#146;t know
whether to trust his intuition or his technology, either was liable to
fail, he being so out of practice at this real-life police detective
shtick. Jack scratched his chin reflexively and tried to ignore the
smell of undisguised human body odor and mulch. The stink of reality.
And what was this word, &quot;Community?&quot;. A rusted memory sunk
deep into the floorboards of Jack&#146;s frontal lobe struggled into his
mind&#146;s eye, a whirling miasma of sandalwood incense and shared living
rooms and Afro-Celtic drumming and unflinching spiritual and emotional
honesty. Even more than the visceral stench of nature, it was this
abominable adherence to truth that most repulsed Jack. The thought of
facing the ugly minefield that was Jack&#146;s relationship with his wife was
too much to bear, and it was that thought that broke the mirror of
Jack&#146;s reflection. This dirty savage named after a compass direction.
Jack couldn&#146;t wait for this mindless Fortune 500 vendetta chase to be
over, get home, luxuriate recumbent in the serendipity-free saccharine
media bath of his CyberSec office. Watch his perfectly scripted reality
TV shows, listen to his computer-generated Bob Dylan songs without
meanings, amongst the prefabbed pristine marble swept only by the sweet
zephyrs of climate control and skirtsuit perfume. <P>&quot;Is that your daughter, there?&quot; Jack said, eyeing the young
girl who was tethered to one of the two women, trying to pull away to
get to her daddy. They hissed something to her and the girl frowned, but
relented. <P>East&#146;s sun-dried forehead flattened ambiguously, smile lines at the
corners of his mouth erased by a closed stoic stare. <P>&quot;Yes, that is my daughter.&quot; <P>&quot;See, this picture here, that was somebody&#146;s child too. And that
boy&#146;s parents, well, they&#146;re not happy at all about what happened to
their son, right here on your street, earlier this morning. These
people, they have great power.&quot; <P>&quot;They hold your leash, Wraith? And the Tin Men?&quot; <P>&quot;I would put it in other terms, but yes, essentially, I am on the
payroll. What you need to know is that you need to tell me everything
that you know, if you care at all about your daughter.&quot; Jack said,
popping another Altoid into his mouth. East seemed to weigh the thought
carefully, as if considering which betrayal was the lesser of two evils. <P>&quot;There was a&#133; quarrel this morning, yes, although I do not know who
was involved. These happen often, here, you understand. I was out
harvesting copper wire and plastic bottles to melt down, at the
time.&quot; <P>&quot;Is there anyone else who might&#146;ve gotten a good look at
them?&quot; Jack picked up the slightest twitch in East&#146;s right eye. He
could see the skin over the man&#146;s jaw ripple slightly. The Oracles
captioned: &#145;severe distress&#146;. <P>&quot;My daughter. She was out straining the catchment this morning.&quot; <P>Jack crouched down to her eye level. <P>&quot;What did you see honey? Who attacked the kid?&quot; Her hair was
matted the way border collie fur clumps into thick layered scales when
they&#146;re allowed to roam freely, roll about in the dirt. Her eyes were
hot green embers, fierce with a precocious intelligence. She glanced at
Jack&#146;s armored carrier, at the light-absorbing, pristine black leather
of his CyberSec uniform. Clucked her tongue. <P>&quot;He looked like you.&quot; The girl said, pointing to Jack&#146;s
goggles. Jack smiled. <P>&quot;Of course he did. Of course he did.&quot; The little
crunchy-granola Deadweight imp was toying with him. This little
green-thumbed urchin. <P>Then the Oracle&#146;s polygraph results chimed in: 93% probability of truth.
Now that was interesting. <P>&quot;It&#146;s her birthday tomorrow. She&#146;s going to have her first birthday
cake. Almost all the sugar cane was eaten in the machine plagues and
it&#146;s taken us months to collect the ingredients.&quot; East said. Jack
almost said it was his own daughter&#146;s birthday today, then it hit him
how he&#146;d completely neglected to even remember it let alone expend
energy collecting cake ingredients. He filled with an intoxicating
cocktail of disgust, guilt, and infantile hatred that felt like a puffer
fish in his stomach. <P>&quot;She&#146;s very excited, aren&#146;t you, Sunrise?&quot; East said. The girl
nodded her head, popping a cherry tomagranite into her mouth. A
genespliced variant, highly resistant to hydra rust. Also a copyrighted
strain, owned by Demetric, and it was vanishingly unlikely these jobless
Deadweights were paying the monthly thousand dollar rent to lawfully
grow the tomato-pomegranate hybrid. Jack could&#146;ve taken them all in for
agricultural piracy, if he were in a bad mood. Rich, pink soup spurted
from Sunrise&#146; lips as the hybrid fruit burst its sweet tartness. Her
father snatched the remaining tomagranites from her thatched satchel
before she could toss another of the plum-sized juice bombs in her
mouth. <P>&quot;Sunrise, now you know it&#146;s not polite to eat in front of
guests.&quot; East said. She scowled her complaint but didn&#146;t attempt to
steal them back. Jack smiled with half his face. <P>These people reminded Jack of his wife and her bizarrely renewed
nonconformity. He could see her, here, amongst these apocalypse
gardeners, dipping her fragile, post-industrial hands into the rough,
tarry soil of a boulevard parkway, mouthing something about reclaiming
the soil for Gaia. She would reset, retrace the song line of a Steely
Dan anthem back to the dreamtime of liberal undergraduate California,
carved out of the austerity rubble. Her lips accepting the Earthy gift
of kava drink, languishing in the incensed ambience of didgeridoo and
sitar strung with frayed bridge cables. Here, she would forget her
nursing career truncated by quasi-sentient blood pressure machines. She
would forget her underwater and soon-to-be-repossessed home, the private
school tuition she could no longer afford. She would forget her distant
husband whom she&#146;d forgotten how to love. She would forget about being
stuck, and worrying about being stuck. <P>Her neon batik silk whirling dreamlike under bioluminescent lighting
would strike sparks off the eye of a djembe virtuoso. He would court her
with black Hindu magic, say he&#146;d seen her through a third eye. She would
want to and then would believe him, riding the velvet crest of a
lungfull of cannabis. They would make love in the back seat of a
permanently stalled VW Bus, make love like Jack hadn&#146;t since before he&#146;d
taken the CyberSec job, and she would feel nothing but the hot flare of
youth and bliss uninterrupted by guilt, uncomplicated. Guilt could wait,
could be postponed, like a refinanced mortgage. The image expanded to
fill Jack&#146;s mind like a computer virus, compromising his every thought,
and the immune reaction was a tremendous and impotent hatred. <P>Jack knew these things, because he could see his wife&#146;s song lines,
traced in time and space like snail trails, on the GPS tracking window
he&#146;d obtained from her wireless provider&#146;s database. Jack, through his
privileged access as a corporate security officer, had been monitoring
his wife&#146;s every credit card purchase, every email, had watched her
through a thousand intelligent surveillance cameras stationed throughout
the city. He knew that Joy had been lying to him for months. Every
weekday yoga class, every visit to her sister in Red Wood, every morning
when he would kiss her goodbye and they would both do their best to
soften their lips like sponges, as if to soak up the mess with
pleasantry into the trajectory of the past. Jack knew. And he never said
anything, would never say anything. Because Jack was a grown up, unlike
all of these frolicking, crunchy, nymph-like children, and that is what
grown ups do. They keep quiet about systemic problems and double down.
Bailout. They refinance. <P>&quot;Well, better run the place through the wash,&quot; Jack mumbled,
cracking the remaining sliver of Altoid, thin as communion host, against
the roof of his mouth. It was a comforting and familiar sensation. <P>Jack dialed in directives to the intra-cloud network, twitches of his
finger tips, read as input by his haptic gloves. A team of RPLCNTS
fanned out like an oil slick from the rear loading bay of the
carbon-black, behemoth class CyberSec vehicle. The roboSWAT team grouped
organically into squads following a flocking algorithm that Jack had
personally helped develop during a contracting project for the US
Department of Defense. Mostly the software was used to automate the
slaughter of Kenyans and Kazakstanis who, it was revealed, were sitting
on caches of lithium and copper the size of the Himalayan mountain
range. Lithium's and copper&#146;s vital r&ocirc;les in electronics having replaced
long-peaked oil as the fulcrum for the next resource war, of course. The
ability of the human race to find new reasons to kill one another in the
face of insurmountable abundance was truly commendable. The advent of
the robotized ground troop solved the PR problem of flag-wrapped
coffins coming back from war zones, and the bleeding-heart journalist fodder
created when Predator drones accidentally blew up hospitals full of
Pakistani children went away. With those moral safeties clicked off,
half of Asia and most of Africa was leveled and strip-mined in less than
a decade by US robo-military campaigns. <P>The RPLCNTS immediately began securing the perimeter. Green zone was
demarcated on Jack&#146;s heads-up-display by a film of lime-colored
territory spreading across an aerial map like algae in a pond. Through
an adjacent matrix of livestreaming troop feeds, Jack could see that the
bottom three floors of the San Francisco Giants building, even the
interiors, were blanketed in graffiti and gunshot holes. Primate pissing
matches played out in neon red and vomit-green street kanji, then
diplomacy continued by other means. Esoteric Kurt Vonnegut quotes and
six-foot-wide stenciled portraits of Che Guevara cried truths against
the wall of violence and misspelled inanity. These political art seemed
to post-date the rest, suggesting the gangs had either moved on or had
mutually assured one anothers&#146; destruction. The building was mostly
filled with countless grey-collars, the overeducated poor who&#146;d either
been replaced in their office by a robot or who were enslaved to their
200k student loans, and for whom no job outside prostitution and unpaid
social work would ever come. They tended to their shoebox shitakes,
absorbed themselves in dead media like paper books and sculpture. Some
even played those face-to-face roleplaying video games called
&quot;theater". Jack and Stasia remotely questioned the denizens, most
of whom either had not seen the event or were too numb to care. The
drone SWAT teams encountered a few wyrehead junkies spewing braindead
strings of cursewords. One attempted to attack a soldrone with a ball
peen hammer.  The audio feed roared as what remained of the junkie's
brain was splattered all over his non-functioning refrigerator by the
bot's hollow point rounds. The sight made him feel uneasy, so Jack
changed channels. <P>&quot;No one else home,&quot; Stasia said, double checking a
satellite-based body heat scan of the building. <P>The arachnoid forensics bots continued the arduous task of scrubbing the
vicinity for evidence &#150;marks, tracks, blood, DNA -- crawling physical
reality for every last byte of data, aggregating it in CyberSec&#146;s
servers. What the Troubleshooters discovered was, well, troubling. <P>&quot;Christ, it&#146;s like they edited out a slice of reality. All of the
security footage from CCTV cams, even the spydrones flying over during
the incident apparently came down with temporary cases of anterograde
amnesia. All our audiovisual records of that five minute period are
blank,&quot; Stasia said. <P>&quot;Yeah. Curious, isn&#146;t it? Winklemann&#146;s not going to be happy with
this.&quot; <P>Other than the corpse of the Deadweight accountant, the only real piece
of evidence were two Tyr X2 bodyguard robots. One had been mowed down,
so many bullet holes perforating its chrome chassis that it resembled a
cheese grater. Jack knelt down beside the collapsed humanoid, its
secret-service windbreaker ripped to shreds, its plastoid skin peeling
from its face like a third-degree sunburn. <P>&quot;That&#146;s heavy weaponry they were carrying,&quot; Stasia commented.
Jack aimed his dVice camera at the QR barcode on the neck of the
android. <P>&quot;Assuming the assailant was carrying it. Let&#146;s run these serial
numbers.&quot; <P>The other Tyr had a small puncture at the nape of its neck. Jack
examined the hole, inserting an arthroscopic microcam into the &#145;wound&#146;
and fishing around. <P>&quot;The central processor is fried,&quot; he added. <P>&quot;You thinking another bot glitch SNAFU?&quot; Stasia asked. <P>&quot;Maybe. A coincidental malfunction is certainly what they&#146;d want us
to think happened, anyway. Hold on, Winklemann&#146;s on the line.&quot; Jack
looked at the flashing avatar of his boss, expanding a videoconference
that occluded the charts and informatics of the investigation's
augmented reality overlays. <P>&quot;What have you got for me, Jack,&quot; Winklemann cut to it with
his eternally hurried, upper-managerial inflection. <P>&quot;The kid&#146;s still unconscious but stable. Prognosis uncertain, it&#146;s
50-50 whether he&#146;ll snap out of the coma. We&#146;ve got two body guards,
both owned by his parents. Where it gets interesting is we just cross
checked the Tyrs, and the bullets that Swiss-cheesed one bodyguard match
up with the .50 cal subdermal forearm cannon of its counterpart.&quot; <P>&quot;So the guard robot went Hal 9000, short circuited and started
shooting at friendlies. Wouldn&#146;t be the first time, and at least since
this was bot-on-bot homicide we won&#146;t have to blackout the story from
the internets like the School Bus incident down in Gnossis Plaza.&quot; <P>&quot;That&#146;s possible but I highly doubt the culprit was buggy software.
For one, we just finished patching up the targeting systems heuristics
and enemy acquisition AIs for the entire drone fleet this morning. Then
there&#146;s the fact that the BIOS clocks of the totaled Tyr and its
counterpart are frozen within seconds of each other, as if once the
puppeteer was done, he cut the strings from his marionette and made
off.&quot; <P>&quot;Puppeteer. That&#146;s your diagnosis? Ok, fine, Mr. Conspiracy Theory. Roll it out for me.&quot; <P>&quot;I checked out the stab wound at the back of the other guard&#146;s
neck. It&#146;s bull&#146;s-eye within a half-inch sized target, a backdoor port
into the Tyr&#146;s system used for debugging purposes during beta testing.
Whoever struck the blow, it wasn&#146;t just a reactionary defensive stab, it
was a calculated hostile takeover attack. These are not your run of the
mill necropolis street punks. They had intimate knowledge of Totech
android anatomy. Knew just the right switch to flip.&quot; <P>&quot;They could&#146;ve gotten lucky, went for the bot&#146;s head and scored the
central processor.&quot; <P>&quot;Highly unlikely. Residue analysis of the exposed wire and CPU
suggests that whatever the foreign object was, it was electrical.
Perhaps some kind of spine-based remote operation ice pick. There are no
signs of other firearms discharged in any of the visual or audio CCTV
feeds suggesting this guy was unarmed. These were professionals, black
hat hackers.&quot; <P>&quot;Fantastic, just what we need. Unwashed masses with brains. I
thought we had that problem kicked with reality TV and Angry Hamsters.
Goddamnit, times like these I wish we still had paper books so we could
torch them all like Fahrenheit 451. Who do you think is behind it,
assuming your theory is true?&quot; <P>&quot;There&#146;s the usual suspects, the Washingtonians, but they spend too
much time bleating on about how government is trampling the US
constitution to reach that level of technical sophistication. And
they&#146;re more about giving their lives for God and Country M16 in hand,
blaze of patriotic glory and all that. They&#146;d probably view such an
attack as vaguely dishonorable commy-tactics. We can&#146;t rule out a covert
strike by Pfeiffer Pharmaceutical or one of Vitanet&#146;s other major
competitors looking to take out a VIP then use the circumstances to
frame the murder on jobless necropolis slumdogs. But if I had to, I&#146;d
put my money on Hex Gen.&quot; <P>&quot;Generation Hex. Those V For Vendetta-guzzling hacktivists, of
course. Fine. Whoever the culprit, what we need to do right now is pin
the murder on World Class War. Hex Gen and WCW have had loose
associations and it&#146;s going to be guilt by association 24/7.&quot; <P>&quot;Won&#146;t that be a little challenging to spin? I mean we don&#146;t even
know who the assailant is.&quot; <P>&quot;Nah, it&#146;s no problem. Hell, since we&#146;ve acquired MediaVerse, we&#146;ve
got every major news channel, e-newspaper, and network on a tight leash
and the President is doing his part to declare all the whistleblowers
terrorists and have them disappeared systematically, no sweat off our
backs. Elections are coming up and it&#146;s crucial that we crush popular
support of this underclass movement ASAP. Gnossis and our other generous
employers have dumped hundreds of billions of dollars into President
Vanderlyle&#146;s campaign and it is absolutely imperative that he is sworn
into office for another term. Or it&#146;s all of our heads, it goes without
saying. If we can just get that American Anti-Piracy Act passed we could
file all of the web censorship and attacks like this airstrike under the
blanket immunity clause of &#145;defending US cybersecurity&#146;. Make this all
so much easier.&quot; <P>&quot;Airstrike? What airstrike?&quot; Jack felt his temperature drop
two degrees, his stomach suddenly became a cold, sinking stone. <P>"Oh, right, you&#146;re not in on this loop yet. Our &#145;generous benefactors&#146;,
the ones personally funding this operation, seems they need a certain
sense of closure. A nuclear, multi-block leveling, megaton sense of
closure.&quot; <P>An ill wind descended, drawing cryptic runes in the red desert of the
San Francisco sky, like the mark of some terrible and ancient alien
race, aroused from its epochal slumber. Bloated corpses drifted like
unprocessed lumps of sewage through the grey tide beneath the gaping
ruins of the Golden Gate. Omens. Preambles to the indiscriminate wrath
of infantile gods. <P>&quot;You&#146;re serious,&quot; Jack mouthed. He felt his heart rate spike,
microscopic nanomed machines swimming in his arteries synthesized
angiotensin blockers automatically to counteract his heightened blood
pressure. <P>&quot;Am I affecting a humorous tone? Yes. I have an executive order
straight from the top to do a 426 on the entire area code.&quot; The
usual static from wireless communications borne by sketchy necropolis
cell towers suddenly cut out, as if emphasizing the message. <P>&quot;An LV426? Take off, nuke the site from orbit? Isn&#146;t that kind of
overkill? I thought this was a crime scene, not a re-enactment of the
Hell&#146;s Kitchen Predator drone massacre.&quot; <P>&quot;Hey, that wasn&#146;t our fault, we had bad intel from the CIA.
Besides, it was a festering sore of jobless insurgents. The World Class
War mobs had publicly executed the CEO of Nationwide Bank, hung him by
his own tie from the Wall Street Bull. For fucks sake, they nearly took
down a fifty story corporate tower with explosives concocted from
nothing but gene-hacked ammonia-rich algae and pinesol. Fucking algae
bombs! You ever heard of that shit? An example had to be made. Top it
off, yeah, come on you stingy whore.&quot; Jack could hear the tinkle of
crystal champagne flutes through Winkleman&#146;s phone, the oceanic burble
of a party crowd, live smooth jazz. <P>&quot;Carpet bombing fourteen city blocks worth of apartments full of
families who had nothing to do with the movement at all? That was
setting an example?&quot; <P>&quot;Jack, Jack. My boy. Of course I don&#146;t want to see innocent people
killed any more than you do. Of course we&#146;d prefer to control the hoi
polloi with hope. It&#146;s much more efficient in the cost-benefit analysis
to have people believing, falsely, that they can Be Whatever They Want
When They Grow Up in America, satisfied with their McDonald&#146;s
shit-shoveling job limping along on foodstamps and Wal Mart as long as
they can turn on their &#145;Tubevisions and strive to be American Idols and
Jersey Shore Playgirls one day. But with this&#133; extent to which things
have managed to deteriorate, it&#146;s becoming harder and harder to sell the
shit sandwiches as caviar, convince the people that their debt shackles
are their tickets to a better life. So now we&#146;ve got to rely on good old
fashioned People&#146;s Republic of China-style fear of Authority with an
itchy trigger finger. It&#146;s &#150; what do those World Class War lefty
financial journalists call it? Moral Hazard. That&#146;s it.  This is about
reinstating moral hazard. There&#146;s got to be an equal and opposite
deterrent to the degree of outrage in the general population. They start
getting the cajones up to cut the heads off the royalty, well, we&#146;ve got
to fire an ion cannon at the poorer half of Manhattan. Now they know the
hazard of being moral. One day you will understand how business actually
works, son.&quot; <P>&quot;Alright. Fine. You need to put shock and awe back into the hearts
of the irreverent peasants. I just don&#146;t see how indiscriminately
blowing up random swaths of population, many of whom are not necessarily
active World Class War members or part of any other resistance movements
is going to draw down support for WCW. Cause it just seems like we&#146;re
going to have another World Trade Center&#146;s worth of unemployed martyrs,
all of whom will have mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who
will be filled with fiery jihad, devoting the rest of their lives to
taking down the &#145;Plutocrats&#146;, the Great Satans who stole their loved
ones and destroyed their lives. Why not just go after the extremists?
The insurgents who are doing actual damage taking out Ameribank City
financial towers, assassinating hedge fund managers and actively
plotting to bring down the global financial system. I mean these people
here, they&#146;re just human beings who got the dirty end of the
stick.&quot; Jack could feel his inner lawyer suddenly flipping to the
side of the smelly hippies he&#146;d silently despised minutes ago, once he
was asked to massacre them. <P>&quot;Christ, don&#146;t refer to them as &#145;human beings&#146;. Don&#146;t do that to
yourself; it&#146;s bad for your psyche, all this humanizing of your victims.
Unbecoming of a Troubleshooter. No, thank you Sylvia, I&#146;m fine. Tell the
governor I&#146;ll be out in a minute,&quot; Winkleman said to someone at
whatever $10 million-a-plate dinner function or economics conference he
was attending, slurping down what sounded like some kind of chilled
shellfish on the line. He cleared his throat, continued. <P>&quot;Look, Mother Theresa, I&#146;m not going to spend all day arguing
asymmetric warfare ethics with you. This is a direct order and you WILL
execute. Diamond wants someone, anyone, to pay for his son&#146;s death. Maybe
he&#146;s overreacting; whatever, it&#146;s moot. Alistair Diamond is one of our
largest and most well-connected shareholders, and happens to be the
brother of the Cybersecurity Senate Subcommittee head, the group that
will make or break the American Anti-Piracy Act. I don&#146;t care if Diamond
asks CyberSec to assassinate the President of China or mow down a
Catholic school full of Canadian children with Panzer tanks or open up a
singularity at Earth&#146;s core just so he can laugh at the poor below,
martini in hand, from his low-orbit ISS villa&#146;s swimming pool. You will
execute, Jack, or you will find yourself, very soon, jobless, cowering
in one of these decrepit Plebian sinkholes without running water,
imagining your wife and kid kissing some other man with steelier balls
than you who took your job, wondering with your last breath why you
ever for one moment had second thoughts about your vocation&#146;s duties
both to CyberSec and to Ameribank City. And then your life will end,
horribly and without even an acknowledgement in your former friends&#146;
status updates, beneath the great vengeance and furious anger of a
drone-fired CyberSec lead zeppelin, just like the one you&#146;re about to
call down on the tens of thousands of people eeking out their pathetic,
gutter-moss-and-cardboard-box lives in that wasteland called San
Francisco.&quot; Serious as bioengineered, weapons-grade cancer. <P>&quot;Oh, I should add. There&#146;s a juicy forty-k bonus tied to this
mission as well, plus a week-long paid junket in Switzerland for you and
your wife upon completion. The President Wilson Hotel, Imperial Suite.
Only the best for Ameribank City&#146;s Finest. The monk seal sashimi there
is mind boggling. You&#146;ve gotta try it.&quot; <P>The endangered cuisine wasn&#146;t exactly Jack&#146;s cup of tea, but the $40,000
would be enough to keep their daughter in private school another
semester, maybe pull them above water in their mortgage payments long
enough for Jack and his wife to spend a few dinner table conversations
not fighting about money. Jack could feel his angels and demons being
shouted off his shoulders by the megaphone of Darwinian survival. There
were breadlines of double PhDs and former IT workers gunning for Jack&#146;s
position. Jack didn&#146;t have the luxury of not working. He couldn&#146;t think
about what would happen if he lost his job and he and his family fell
behind in their citizenship payments. <P>&quot;Well, hey, Jack! It&#146;s been great chatting, but I&#146;ve got a couple
of hundred thousand dollar human trafficked Yugoslavian sex slaves here
that I need to ruin before the night is over, followed by 18 holes with
the governor of Texas and the CEO of Caco Cola on board his
two-mile-wide airship. Insider trading tips, brainstorming ways to get
students and homeowners deeper in debt, reversing progressive labor
rights, oh, and there&#146;s that damned Financial Fraud Protection Act that
we need to have congress defang now that their election season is over.
All that boring stuff I know you don&#146;t like hearing about. Get this, the
zeppelin's gas bags are built entirely with paper recycled from back
issues of Atlas Shrugged! Who knew you could make fricking blimps out of
paper? You learn something new everyday. Anyway, I&#146;ll leave you to your
mass murdering now. Do try to enjoy your work, Jack. It&#146;s important to
take joy in your work. Remember, you&#146;re one of our best. I have faith in
you, my boy. Sylvia! Jesus, that&#146;s my ballsa-&quot; The signal cut out. <P>Muther fucking vindictive mega-rich parents. That acquired sociopathy
born when a hundred floors of money are placed between the rich and
their fellow human beings, running their Starbucks coffee and polishing
their thousand dollar shoes below. What were simple butchers, bakers,
and candlestick makers with feelings and lives and families, from two
thousand feet in an autopiloted Gulfstream, suddenly became nothing but
ants, insects. To be crushed beneath boot heels. Jack discovered that
familiar and burning hatred for Winklemann, for the Diamond family who&#146;d
ordered him here to commit their war crimes free of the &quot;cognitive
load&quot;, outsourcing the heavy crucifix onto Jack&#146;s shoulders. Jack
insulated himself in that hot membrane of hate and blame, and it
assuaged any sense of guilt long enough for him to carry out what he had
to carry out. <P>&quot;Stasia, I need you to de-activate all 3G + spectrums and cut all
landline connections in and out of District 8, sectors A-F.&quot; <P>&quot;Why, Jack? What&#146;s going on? What did Winklemann say?&quot; <P>Jack strode briskly toward the CyberSec APC, jumped into the front seat,
and grabbed the intercom mic on the dashboard of the cockpit. It was too
quiet out. No bombshells rumbling in the distance, no gunshots tapping
off. Not even the screams of domestic violence and meth-induced Tourette's
syndrome. One of those peculiar moments of peace when a hundred
simultaneous Plebland skirmishes reach the same brief lull. As if all of
San Francisco was holding its breath in anticipation, awaiting the
market correction, the return to the equilibrium level of violence. Jack
switched on the loudspeaker, static and feedback piercing the silent
night, ricocheting off the concrete squalor. <P>"Everyone, get out of here. Now. Get as far away as you can.&quot; <P>&quot;Why? What&#146;s happening?&quot; East shouted back from his Matson
container garden. <P>&quot;Look, trust me, just get out of here. The drones are going to
retaliate.&quot; <P>&quot;But, we have done nothing wrong! We have sowed no evil. Why would
they attack us?&quot; <P>&quot;It doesn&#146;t matter. The reaping is coming, either way. Old
Testament style. The hellfire and the brimstone.&quot; <P>&quot;I don&#146;t trust him. Look at him, he&#146;s got one of them special agent
rent-a-cops uniforms on. What they call them?&quot; someone shouted from
an apartment window. <P>&quot;Troubleshooters.&quot; <P>&quot;Yeah. We ain&#146;t listening to you, you goddamn Troubleshooter thug.
You just trying to smoke us out.&quot; <P>&quot;Fascist!&quot; <P>&quot;We ain&#146;t going nowhere.&quot; A small crowd had gathered now in
the street, perhaps a few dozen, outside the Giants Museum. East
stepped forward from the group, approached the front door of the APC
where Jack sat holding the mic. His dreadlocks were dancing burnt-gold
vines as the wind picked up, sang through the abandoned buildings like
the haunting wail of a seashell. East examined the light-absorbing hull
of the vehicle&#146;s urban camo finish. <P>&quot;Harbinger of death.&quot; East said, crossing his arms. <P>&quot;I&#146;m sorry, East, this isn&#146;t my fault. They would&#146;ve just called in
someone else,&quot; Jack protested. <P>&quot;Save your words, Wraith. I knew you cared about nothing the moment
you arrived.&quot; <P>&quot;Whatever you think of me, it doesn&#146;t matter. You&#146;ve got to tell
them,&quot; Jack said, &quot;They won&#146;t listen to me.&quot; <P>East shook his head. &quot;You said I could trust you, Jack. We
co-operated, gave you what you wanted. You said we&#146;d be ok. You asked me
to trust you and now you are bringing the great flood of fire upon our
home, upon our community. Now I understand, Wraith man. You are indeed
the rider of the final machine. Terminus Machina. But you are not a Bent
One, Wraith. You are merely empty. You are hollow as the Tin Men whom
you command like clockwork figurines, toy soldiers who kill and enslave
my people. You are a master of gadgets, yet you yourself are a gadget, a
gadget of the truly Bent. For unlike the Bent, you understand what you
do, but you do it anyway. I will pray to all the gods for your soul,
Jack the Wraith, for I cannot imagine a worse fate. You are an emptiness
unlike any that I have ever known. I will pray for you.&quot; Jack could
see the dark smile lines branching beneath East&#146;s eyes begin to fill
with water, could see the sadness pull at his face. A man of action,
like Jack, East forced emotion aside, steeled himself and took the
microphone. <P>"Everyone, please, get out of here. Get as far as you can. Do not waste
time with belongings. Run.&quot; East&#146;s amplified voice reverberated
against the city, echoes rising like a tide, and the people, hearing one
of their leaders proclaim the end times, began to flee like scattering
ants. <P>&quot;Stasia, I need you to black out all internet traffic in a twelve
block radius,&quot; Jack summoned a map of the Bay Area, toggled off
markers for all drone units except heavy aircraft. <P>&quot;What are you talking about, Jack? What&#146;s going on?&quot; Stasia
asked, voice trilling with hysteria, like a canary descending, against
its will, into a coal mine. <P>&quot;Just shut down the land lines and cell towers, now. We need to get
a head start on the damage control, minimize the chance of word getting
out.&quot; Jack pinpointed the nearest suitable drone, a monster
annihilator like an F-16 on steroids, carrying enough firepower to turn
Manhattan into the Yucatan crater. <P>&quot;Control damage from what? Jack? Tell me!&quot; Jack ignored her
demands, knowing that she might object to the order if she understood
what it was she was doing. <P><img src="bailout2.jpg"> <P>A few decades ago, nuking a national landmark sports stadium in a major
US city would've been immediately branded a cataclysmic terrorist attack
at best, and the kindling for World War III at worst. Today it was <i>de
rigeur</i> cost-of-doing-business, a meteorological process, a bad
thunderstorm, and everyone would whip out their umbrellas till the
shower of retaliatory tit-for-tats, news reports passed. Barely worthy
of a front page trending topic. <P>"Alright, Jack, it's done. All relays, hubs are off, no packets leaving
the space, not even the faintest HAM radio signal. There's an effective
Faraday cage enclosing all of SoMa. Now can you clue me in to what the
hell this is about?" <P>&quot;Look, I can&#146;t believe we&#146;re being forced to do this either, but
they've ordered a thermonuclear facelift of everything within two miles
of the crime scene. A grudge-nuke special requested by the Diamond
family. And our bosses are finding their own uses for the bombing.
They&#146;re asking us to wipe this entire area code off the face of the
Earth, and then they're going to frame World Class War as the
perpetrators. 'The heat seeking mechanisms on those stinger missiles
degrade rapidly in this humid climate.' 'They should've asked the
Russians for an extended warranty on that warhead.' 'Seems they forgot
to RTFM on that suitcase antimatter bomb. Detonated that tactical
city-buster on themselves. Shame.' That's the official story they're
going to put out." <P>&quot;Jesus Christ, Jack! Think of all those people! There&#146;s no way
they&#146;ll be able to evacuate in time, you&#146;re talking about blowing up
dozens of blocks worth of people leading peaceful lives. Families." <P>&quot;Don&#146;t humanize them, like that. It doesn&#146;t suit you, Us, as
Troubleshooters.&quot; Jack repeated his boss&#146;s words that he&#146;d so
despised mere minutes earlier. Stasia&#146;s eyes crumpled up into that
Scandinavian grimace of universal pain, that frowning Siberian husky
look flowing from an overgrown sense of altruism. He could see the
bright light of innocent passion in her eyes being torn apart by the
tidal forces of market reality. He remembered how it had felt that first
time executing the death warrant on an innocent, and it hurt him to see
her hurt like that, but everyone had to grow up some time. <P>&quot;Jack! We can&#146;t do this! We&#133; I can&#146;t do this. We might mow down
armed insurgents marching into Gnossis Plaza, even take out key leaders
and fomenters of populist resistance. But I can&#146;t allow all these
innocent people to be slaughtered so needlessly, just to sate some
insane, power-drunk Plutocrat&#146;s infantile need for vengeance. I just
can&#146;t allow it.&quot; Stasia&#146;s hand had unconsciously begun to reach for
the .45 caliber slung from her hip. Jack frowned, made a cat's cradle
around her blip in his heads-up display. A pair of roboSWAT drew
together on Stasia&#146;s flank, a swarm of red laser dots converging on her
head like a disco ball. Stasia choked, eyeing the black cold barrels of
a dozen rifles surrounding her. She lowered her hand, and lowered her
head in defeat and shame. <P>&quot;I&#146;m sorry. I won&#146;t tell anyone about this. Imagine that this never
happened, if you can. Close your eyes.&quot; He caught her as she
collapsed into him. He held her, feeling her hot young tears burning
along his neck like holy water. But it did not, he would not, allow it to
faze him. He continued to work even as she broke down, typing commands
into his interface, fixing these &#145;bugs&#146; in the Ameribank system.
Troubleshooting. His skull throbbed with adrenaline and conflict, his
hands shook as he began the process of programming the drone attack, but
if he kept his head just in the right headspace, he could spin the guilt
in his head as bravery and valor, and he held onto that moment like
an alcoholic wife beater to a Sunday sermon. <P>Jack dialed in latitude, longitude, anchored the crosshair on the corner
of King Street and 3rd. Drew a blast radius with his pinky, as if wiping
a smudge from a blemished hardwood table. Is this nuclear strike
acceptable? (Yes/No) Yes. Would you like to include _chemical
_biological agents in this attack? (Check all that apply) Would you like
Atrocity Cleanser Version 6.0 to establish internet traffic censors and
pre-emptive buy up of search engine keywords associated with this
airstrike? (Yes/No) Yes. Would you like SMS alerts of escalating death
toll? (Yes/No) No. Please enter your user name and launch codes now. <P>An investigative journalist was detected in the vicinity by a patrolling
stealth-drone running facial rec examinations on the panicked crowd
running from the site. Jack entered a console command and one of the
RPLCNTs hounded the journalist&#146;s GPS, sprayed him with fully automatic
fire till his body stopped twitching, tossed the corpse in a dumpster. A
mother and child were hit by stray bullets, but the RPLCNTs did not
waver from their predesignated courses sweeping up 'loose ends'. The
father was left to sit on his knees, wail over his young dead family at
ground zero, waiting to be put out of his misery by the cleansing fire
of the behemoth-class bomber drone. <P>&quot;The Archangel is inbound. Time for us to leave.&quot; Jack said.
Stasia sobbed, made no eye contact as she climbed into the rear of the
APC. Jack slammed the heavy reinforced door shut, ignored the screaming
and pounding on the bullet proof glass as the Deadweights tried
desperately to get in, to save themselves from the coming tactical
apocalypse. Toddlers were held up to the window by parents, pleading
that their children might be spared. <P>&quot;Jack&#133;&quot; Stasia began. <P>&quot;We can&#146;t. They&#146;d overrun us if we opened that door.&quot; There
was nothing to be done. No one would bail them out. <P>The APC rolled out, post-haste, towards the Bay Bridge, as the Archangel
reared its self-piloted head. Wingspan twice the width of the bridge
itself, the nuclear drone was like a fissure in the heavens, an ebon
maw, grinning wider as it approached.  An array of oblong metal raked
white stripes across the bloody sky, howling at a supersonic clip in the
direction of the Golden Gate. Jack blocked out the irony. <P>The nuke's marigold blast wave wiped skyscrapers away like cardboard
boxes in a hurricane. It reminded Jack of watching footage from the 2011
Japanese tsunami, being glued to the screen despite the ineffably
terrible event transpiring, unable to look away. Seeing it now, Jack
knew no one could&#146;ve escaped the bomb. Why did he tell the people to
run, why didn&#146;t he tell them to spend their last moments saying goodbye
to one another? East, his daughter, the hippy girls hanging their
clothes, they might&#146;ve made it out of the kill zone in time, if they had
wheels. Maybe they managed to get that VW bus engine to turn. Maybe
there&#146;d be gas. Jack needed to believe that they survived, though a part
of him, the part of him that debugged paramilitary AI firmware, knew
that they were all dead, every last one. His mind&#146;s eye rendered them
now, three tall and one short, a family of nuclear shadows, stenciled on
the incinerated flank of a Starbucks. Too much reality. Jack could taste
the stink. <P>Jack disliked violence. Just thinking about all the immolated innocents
and wailing mothers clinging to lifeless bloody messes that used to be
their children outside his APC window made Jack queasy. He pulled an
abstracted wireframe overlay like a curtain over reality, transforming
the flying body parts into little gold arcade game coins. Adding up to a
$40,000 bonus. This was why Jack preferred to work from the office, have the
robots do all the dirty work; it was all so uncivilized, this war stuff.
It made things much easier, seeing destroyed communities as housing
statistics. Debugged code. Figures in a spreadsheet. He could handle
that.  Jack wondered how anyone ever got any work done before computers.
Jack told himself that he was doing all of this for his wife and
daughter, to float their teetering middle class existence, that he had
no choice but to double down, to refinance. Jack opened a fluffy
talkshow in the upper right corner, tried to focus on the topic which
was the hipness or tastelessness Lord Dada&#146;s dildo-shaped speedo at the
Grammys. Jack felt better already. <P>The trick, Jack reminded himself, always lay in depersonalization,
complication, obfuscation of the massacre into financial numerology.
Market efficiency, supply and demand, and that&#146;s all this was. The
demand for extermination of unwanted humans was skyrocketing, and Jack
was merely filling the niche before someone else did. The holocaust was
simple rational self-interest; what makes the world go round, get off
your high moral horse. Maximized profit in a spreadsheet column. Jack
could feel the thoughts absolving his conscience already, ensconcing his
mind like a warm balm, like Pontius Pilate&#146;s spa and cucumber mask. Jack
checked his Friendbook feeds; smiled as he commented on a picture of
some cousin stuffing jell-o shots in a drunken fiance&#146;s mouth. Jack
fired up a game of Angry Hamsters. He imagined the megaton missiles
screaming overhead toward the San Francisco ground zero as slingshot
rodents, crashing humorously into 8-bit wooden castles. The mounting
dead were cartoon pigs with &#145;x&#146;s on their eyes, each adding points to
Jack&#146;s high score. Within seconds of playing, East and his daughter, the
squatter community, the airstrike, all that unmediated, untargeted
reality ceased to exist, and there was only the flash and bleep of the
rectangular screen, the soothing reptilian dreamstate of the video game. <P><font color=red>Experience this story in the upcoming game, Terminus Machina.</font> <P><small>&copy; Twilite Minotaur 2013 All Rights Reserved </small>
