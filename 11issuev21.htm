<div><i>"A free droplet of liquid naturally assumes a spherical shape, 
which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. The equivalence 
of measurement of energy per unit area to force per unit length can be 
proven by dimensional analysis."<br /><small>Farras Grein</small></i>
<p class="drop">Gawl and Rambersack sprawled in their accustomed seats by the window,
engaged in one of their protractedly serious linguistic discussions. On
this occasion it concerned the possible distinction between &#145;drip&#146; and
&#145;drop&#146;. Sensitive as ever to nuances, Fucis Gawl felt that the respective
vowel sounds had some bearing on the meaning. He brushed away a few crumbs
and refilled their glasses from the complimentary carafe of iced water,
carefully avoiding any spillage on the table.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Wouldn&#146;t you say that &#145;drip&#146; suggests something light, or transient, while
&#145;drop&#146; is altogether more ponderous? The same principle applies to &#145;chip&#146;
and &#145;chop&#146;, or &#145;flip&#146; and &#145;flop&#146;&#148;.
</p>
<p>
Legger Rambersack considered this, shifting slightly to stare out at the
colourful profusion of pert spring flowers which now graced the banks of
the stream on the far side of the road opposite the eating-place which was
their favourite haunt. He tried to think of other comparable pairs of
words. &#145;Grip&#146;, &#145;snip&#146; and &#145;trip&#146; had no corresponding partner, although a
separate case might be made for &#145;snip&#146; and &#145;snap&#146;. &#145;Dip&#146; and &#145;dop&#146; were a
borderline pair. &#145;Ship&#146; and &#145;shop&#146; failed to conform to the proposed rule.
He wasn&#146;t quite convinced.
</p>
<p>
&#147;So you&#146;re saying that a drip is somehow more delicate than a drop, or that
it falls with less force?
</p>
<p>
&#147;Well, think where would you find a drip,&#148; said Fucis. &#147;Taps, gutters,
hat-brims, twigs, leaves&#133; um, shop awnings, those old spiky umbrellas
people used to have&#133;&#148; He paused, having run out of examples.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Icicles,&#148; offered Legger, remembering a severe winter from their
childhood, and the slow thaw which followed.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Exactly. And what do these all have in common, apart, obviously, from
their water content?&#148;
</p>
<p>
Legger frowned, causing a passer-by outside to quicken her step. Even in
lugubrious repose his expression could be intimidating.
</p>
<p>
&#147;I&#146;ll tell you,&#148; said Fucis, making a low horizontal sweep in the air with
his right hand, fingers spread. &#147;They&#146;re relatively close to the ground.
Drips don&#146;t have far to fall, whereas&#133;&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Whereas,&#148; Legger cut in, &#147;&#133;drops, <i>rain</i>drops, for example, have to
fall all the way down from clouds. The lowest of which, by their very
nature, are usually quite some way up. Twenty or thirty thousand feet&#133;&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Or more.&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Yes, so, the <i>force</i> would be so much greater..&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Hence the weightier word, &#145;drop&#146;. Although&#133;&#148; Having almost been persuaded
by his own argument, Fucis spotted a snag.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Although what?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Condensation.&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;What about it?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Pods, balloons, even kites. If they pass through low clouds, water-vapour
would condense on their surface, trickle down, forming&#133;?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;A drip. Drips. Or would they be drops? They could be either. That
complicates things.&#148;
</p>
<p>
They tried to find a way round this difficulty. Legger idly invoked the
possible drying effects of wind. Fucis, avoiding the complications of rain
or condensation, proposed a scenario in which someone leaning back against
the rail of a cruising pod gondola was wearing a backpack containing a
leaking bottle of fruit juice. In that situation at what point did a drip
become a drop, or were they, despite his instinctive doubts, identical?
While they continued to ponder, they decided to order another of the
savoury cheese delicacies for which Quoils was justly renowned.
</p>
<p>
It was hard to believe that only a few months earlier the whole area,
indeed the entire town, was still afflicted by the inadvertent devastation
caused by a well-intentioned experiment. Their poetry, which they took more
seriously than anything else, more indeed than anyone else did, had
naturally been affected by the events of the previous year. In the case of
Fucis Gawl, having hyperactive biotaps on his home territory had caused his
verse to slide down the spectrum of negativity from its customary gloom to
undisguised morbidity:
</p>
<p>
<i>Death stalks the land,</i><br />
<i>unmovingly and everywhere;</i><br />
<i>its unseen hand destroys, degrades</i><br />
<i>beneath the ground,</i><br />
<i>and in the air</i><br />
<i>deploys its deadly blades.</i><br />
<i>See, there! And there!</i><br />
<i>where anybody walks,</i><br />
<i>death stalks.</i>
</p>
<p>
He had not been too sure about &#145;unmovingly&#146;, because although once rooted
the damned things stayed in one place, they did have visibly moving parts.
On balance, he felt justified in leaving it in. He was quite pleased with
the deliberate ambiguity in the final line, where &#145;stalks&#146; served both as a
verb and a noun.
</p>
<p>
Legger Rambersack, never one inclined to hide his feelings, had left no
ambiguity.
</p>
<p>
<i>Biotaps? Biocraps!</i><br />
<i>Where&#146;s all the energy</i><br />
<i>they&#146;re meant to store?</i><br />
<i>They suck! They really suck!</i><br />
<i>They spread decay.</i><br />
<i>They&#146;re rotten to the core.</i><br />
<i>Fuck them, I say.</i>
</p>
<p class=drop>It was a bitter irony that their principal designer, the bronze-haired man
known to the public as Farras Grein, had intended his biotaps to benefit
humanity by providing a non-polluting source of energy capture and storage.
At the laboratory stage the autonomous units had been rigorously tested.
Each one was a compact self-sustaining biochemical factory, an artificial
analogue of a tree, its phototropic leaf-blades serving as highly efficient
solar panels. Under laboratory conditions each unit had functioned
faultlessly. What had not been anticipated was the change in behaviour
which resulted from outdoor planting and the subsequent meshing of subsoil
networks.
</p>
<p>
<i>&#145;The rate of nutrient ingestion was substantially accelerated,&#146;</i>
stated a later independent report, &#145;&#133;..
<i>
the units exhibiting an increasing propensity to attract, immobilise
and draw sustenance from organisms with a body temperature above that
of the surrounding soil.&#146;
</i>
</p>
<p>
After the initial seeding, Grein and his companion Sarsel had amused
themselves by disguising their appearance in order to travel openly in
public. Sarsel was among the few who knew this dedicated man as Pion Octyl
diMotz, founder of Quicksilver. It was on their third visit to assess
progress that he became convinced that the biotaps were behaving
abnormally, and at once realised the gravity of the risk to the local
ecology. At that moment he decided to abandon the masquerade, leaving at
the site accessories such as his visor and the metallic wig that was an
exaggerated parody of his own natural hair.
</p>
<p>
The introduction of the biotaps had been a clandestine operation, but as
soon as he had become aware that the experiment had not only failed, but
had had such ghastly consequences, the reclusive man whom people knew as
Farras Grein had accepted full responsibility. He had made a public
statement to the press and broadcast media, briefly explaining his
motivation, his long-nurtured hopes, and the bitter disappointment he and
his development team shared with all those who had been affected. He
promised to do whatever he could to heal the damage.
</p>
<p>
While the local council deliberated, Grein had unhesitatingly stepped in
with an offer to provide and supervise, free of charge and for as long as
required, a team of personnel from his biotap labs, together with any
necessary protective gear and excavating equipment. He also offered to
cover the cost of restoration and landscaping. In a rare instance of a
swift collective decision, the council agreed to this, well aware that they
themselves lacked the technical expertise to deal with the decontamination,
and not averse to conserving their own precious funds for other less
demanding projects.
</p>
<p>
Many locals were unimpressed, resentful and unconvinced. Most had never
heard of Farras Grein. Even those who had, perhaps vaguely aware of his
supposed wealth, would not have known his real name, and were unlikely to
have any appreciation of his scientific credentials or of his integrity.
Opinions began to change as the renovation project progressed, and some
more assiduous journalists reported that &#145;Farras Grein&#146; himself had taken
responsibility for funding and organizing the entire restoration project.
</p>
<p>
Biotaps were designed to be tenacious, to withstand temperature
fluctuations, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. Algorithms
ensured they could learn and employ further protective measures. Taking no
chances, Grein had arranged to equip his clean-up squad with anti-hazard
suits developed by the Advanced Fabrics labs in Snoak; a costly but
necessary precaution.
</p>
<p>
Grein cautiously tested the array of defensive mechanisms using robotic
probes. His squad found that the task of removing an established biotap was
like trying to defuse a booby-trapped bomb, with the additional
complication that each one was not only sensitive to interference, but its
evolved defensive strategies were instantly shared with all other units.
Leaf-blades acquired scalpel-sharp edges, deformed into blinding mirrors.
Wiry tendrils uncoiled reflexively, flicking out thin glutinous streamers
of formic acid. The central stems resisted being grasped, exuding slick
lubricants or armouring themselves with barbed sheaths.
</p>
<p>
It had not occurred to Grein to incorporate an &#145;off&#146; switch into his
biotaps, an omission he sorely regretted as he surveyed the devastated
townscape of Smatparrox. Wherever there had been a flower bed, an earth
bank, a private garden or a patch of waste ground, the flashing blades of
biotaps had replaced any existing flora, many of their hard bright stems
surrounded by shards of bone, stray feathers and clumps of fur. While a
biotap was still active, Grein concluded that any attempt to extract it
using conventional implements would be futile. He reserved the option of
using explosives as a last resort, and looked for less drastic
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Fast-setting concrete was a possibility, but he was concerned about the
sheer scale of application and subsequent removal, if only in terms of the
physical labour required. After consultation with his support staff they
launched a two-pronged attack using liquid nitrogen to shut down any
ongoing processes, followed by a polyurethane foam sealant to make
extraction more manageable. It was a painstaking procedure, each
deactivation needing to be checked repeatedly before an individual biotap
could at last be mechanically extracted.
</p>
<p>
The remaning problem was the disposal of the root system, programmed to
send its capillary filaments in search of essential minerals, forming
further nodes from which new biotaps had emerged. They had to be sure that
any residual commands trapped within the dense expanded network were
totally expunged. Grein and his team ensured that the entire area was
systematically evacuated, summoned a fleet of powerful mobile generators,
fired a series of simultaneous high voltage bursts through heavily
insulated cables into the subsoil at every biotap nexus. Smoke and steam
leaked from the superheated ground in every direction.
</p>
<p>
Further weeks passed before the ground was deemed safe enough for the inert
topsoil to be removed. A chain of freight transporters conveyed it to
Platport, from where it began a three-month voyage to an isolated volcanic
island.
</p>
<p class=drop>Cendrel Pirch had been munching her way through breakfast, trying to
recapture a fading dream involving a brightly-coloured bird and a pair of
lost sunglasses, when her e-screen buzzed. She reached out automatically
and thumbed it on. An unfamiliar voice said, &#147;Good morning, Miss Pirch. I
hope I&#146;m not disturbing you.&#148; It was a pleasant enough voice, in which she
thought she could detect a distinct edge of weariness. Nudging her e-screen
closer, she peered at the face: high forehead, deep-set eyes, sensitive
mouth, a growth of stubble suggesting he had not had time to use a
depilatory. The leonine mane of reddish-gold hair had a metallic glint. She
did not know him, but she had definitely heard of someone who fitted his
description.
</p>
<p>
What he said next caused her to wonder whether she was still asleep.
</p>
<p>
&#147;I&#146;m Farras Grein, and I am in urgent need of your help.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Cendrel laughed. He was obviously a hired actor.
</p>
<p>
&#147;No, you&#146;re not,&#148; she said, rapidly trying to think which of her friends
might be silly enough to attempt such a hoax, and why. Surely not Tebbi!
Strag, perhaps? No, he had outgrown such pranks. And Ruckers and Sawly were
still roaming about abroad.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Miss Pirch, I assure you that I <i>am</i> Farras Grein, and I apologise
for the informality, but we&#146;re rather pressed for time, and I would like to
present you with an unusual opportunity. Let me show you. Please keep
watching.&#148;
</p>
<p>
His face vanished, and the view panned to an outdoor perspective: a bleak,
cratered urban landscape, looking like historical vids of war-zones,
although she noticed that no buildings appeared to be damaged. She could
see an intact town hall and other nearby municipal offices which looked
vaguely familiar. Clusters of people in protective suits, some wielding
probes or other devices, were examining the ground.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Isn&#146;t that&#133;&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;This is the centre of Smatparrox, Miss Pirch.&#148;
</p>
<p>
The man, whose identity had suddenly become more convincing, reappeared on
the screen, looking genuinely pained.
</p>
<p>
&#147;It was my birthplace, my childhood home. I tried to give it the benefit of
years of energy research, but instead, unwittingly, I gave rise to a
catastrophe. I am trying to make amends. All the biotaps and their
underground interconnections have been removed, and now the place
desperately needs someone with your skills and vision to restore it to
health. I know something of your background, and I have been impressed by
the landscaping you have created in Snoak and elsewhere.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Cendrel was thoroughly awake now. She bit her lip, feeling stupid for
having harboured doubts.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Mr Grein. Yes. Look, I&#146;m so sorry. I couldn&#146;t help thinking that one of my
friends had&#133;&#148; She shook her head. &#147;I can&#146;t imagine how you must feel, but
I&#146;m really surprised and flattered that you think I could contribute. So,
we&#146;re talking about the area around the town centre?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;We are talking about the entire town, Miss Pirch. If you were to accept
this commission, you would have carte blanche with respect to materials &#150;
topsoil, sand, compost, fertilisers, whatever. And of course the choice of
what to plant, and where, subject to the approval of the local council,
which I am sure would be forthcoming. Money would not be a problem. Any
equipment you need can be provided. If you require specialists,
horticultural or otherwise, they can and will be found. Local people are
anxious to be involved, and I think it is essential that they should be,
for the sake of the community, but they will require guidance, and an
overall plan. You&#146;ll need time to think about this, perhaps discuss
possible arrangements for a leave of absence from your work in Garrible
Park. I&#146;ll understand if you&#146;re really not interested, or have too many
commitments, but we are looking for a landscape designer such as yourself,
with flair and vision.&#148;
</p>
<p>
It did not take her long to make her decision.
</p>
<p>
Now the biotaps had gone, and Smatparrox had been transformed. The northern
end of the new municipal gardens was bounded by stepped terraces from which
trailing plants cascaded down to the foam of blossoms which crowned a
crescent of fruit saplings.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the town the devastated topsoil had been replaced with an
organically healthy, well-drained and nutrient-rich layer of loam,
nourishing not only the new areas of lawn, both public and private, but
also the thousands of carefully-selected plants and shrubs which now
delighted the senses of locals and visitors alike.
</p>
<p>
Cendrel had enlisted the help of specialist hydraulic engineers to convert
a chain of scorched craters into a linked series of ponds, fed by a
tributary of the Stirrow. Friends in the Ecological Protection League had
offered advice on sourcing appropriate aquatic flora and fauna. The
resulting ponds became places of interest for many of the local
schoolchildren, and convenient study topics for some of their more
enthusiastic teachers.
</p>
<p>
Among her other innovations were the branching walkways providing safe
access between the various civic facilities. The longer walkways, bordered
of course with an eclectic profusion of botanical varieties, harboured
sheltered rest areas, which before long became popular spots for trysts and
picnics. Busking musicians were tolerated, but a local bye-law prohibited
itinerant food and drink vendors from plying their wares.
</p>
<p class=drop>At Quoils the two poets were still exploring the tricky byways of their
craft, oblivious as ever to the comings and going of other customers. They
had eventually agreed that for all practical purposes the distinction
between a drip and a drop remained (so to speak) fluid, and that the use of
the diminutive &#145;droplet&#146;, while having a certain euphony, did not
necessarily refer to a yet smaller discrete quantity of liquid. This led
them to another metaphorical thicket; namely, the precise description of
falling water in states between a drip (or drop) and a dribble, and what
degrees of flow separated a dribble from a trickle, and how to describe
intermediate conditions between a trickle and a gush, and whether a splash
defined an event irrespective of volume.
</p>
<p>
&#147;What about viscosity?&#148; Fucis Gawl demanded abruptly.
</p>
<p>
Legger dragged his unfocused gaze away from the window.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Mmm?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Not water, but engine oil, treacle, tar, molten glass&#133; Different
consistencies, different <i>kinds </i>of drip. Tacky, glutinous!&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Blobs!&#148; cried Legger, with renewed enthusiasm. &#147;Globs. <i>Gobbets!</i>&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Not splash, but <i>splat!</i>&#148;
</p>
<p>
They grinned at each other, sharing the elation of discovery. These were
the first cautious steps into new territory. While they had been exchanging
ideas Quoils had somehow filled with diners; mostly local residents
accustomed to seeing these two indolent aesthetes in their preposterous
capes and broad-brimmed hats. Little did those people know they were in the
presence of pioneers.
