<div><i><font color=green><b>Great, Nou, I did like this concept. I've read it just once and made 
comments on the fly, but basically it's fine. Loved the way your anchorman
chopped up his sentences! I just had a couple of wha'?
moments	on continuity. I'll revisit the story later and see if they still worry me.</b></font></i>
<p class=drop>Agnotious C. Clehrley scowled his way through the station crowds, his face an 
topographic map of angry contours. He was well ahead of schedule; his train 
wouldn't leave for half an hour yet, longer if he felt like spreading some of 
his mood around. <P>He pushed his cap back, letting the air-con chill the sweaty tide line for a 
moment before screwing it down again tightly, deeply aware that his train would 
not be taking off this afternoon, that it would not soar through the skies like 
the spirit of freedom itself; that the amber wings sewn, spread, above his cap's 
plastic brim were simply the logo of AERAIL TRANSCONT, Inc., and not a proud 
badge of achievement. Never to be saluted; never to be stared at in awe by a six 
year-old lad invited to a cockpit to experience a formative moment; never to win 
one of a string of fleeting coital victories from the crotches of airhostesses 
and breathy passengers alike. He was not a pilot; he was a driver. No-one would 
ever call him "Captain", apart from that smart-mouthed conductor. Hell, he was 
more likely to be called <font color=green><b> Should that be 'Brakes', or have I missed the point? 
 Ed.</b></font>  "Breaks Technician" for all the control he had over his route through life. <P>"Morning, Cap'n!" yapped the smart mouth. Agnotious grunted in return as his 
chirpy, blonde conductor fell in beside him with wingman precision, smiling left 
and right. At least the crowds were parting quicker for two. "Where to today, 
Aggy? Right between those rails, right?" The smart mouth laughed easily, as if 
he hadn't just reduced another man's whole life to a pair of parallel lines 
heading for a vanishing point of utter meaninglessness. Agnotious tried not to 
bare his grinding teeth. <P>Down the escalators and out onto the platform, the heat hit him like a slap and 
Aggy started to sweat properly. Angrily. Four hours in his seat to look forward 
to, wet cooling in the crack of his pants as a chill straight from the Antarctic 
dryly circulated "for his comfort", and so he wouldn't 
fall asleep at the wheel - at the dead man's switch, rather. He squinted up at 
the sun - no way could this day get any worse. <P>"Brothers - sisters," called the voice. <i>Ah, nuts</i>, thought Aggy. Here we go. <P>The prophet wore his hair long, tied back in a tan-blonde ponytail, with a light 
beard attractively dusting his softly angular jaw line. His eyes, pale brown, 
looked with friendly intensity from face to face, smiling with knowing sympathy 
towards those whose own more nervous gazes flinched away from his as quickly as 
they had alighted; or nodding with frankly assumed camaraderie to the braver 
souls, even hostile ones like Aggy. As always, Aggy couldn't be totally sure 
that it was the same one as the day before. <P>"Brothers - sisters - I have words your hearts would hear. Pause a moment, if 
you may, for I will not take long, and your train will not be leaving soon." <P>"Is, is that what passes for prophetic wisdom these days?" called Aggy 
contemptuously, catching himself half by surprise. His conductor sucked in a 
nervous breath; Aggy's flagrant disregard for Aerail's "Sunshine" policy always 
put him on edge, and it wasn't as if he could even tell the guy off for it - 
Unhappy Employees Make For Unhappy Travellers, as they had both recited in the 
past, and Aggy was his driver after all. <P>"Oh, come on, Cap," he said, extra brightly, "He's doing no harm, I'm sure." 
Aggy tutted derisively, but it was the prophet who spoke first. <P>"No, brother Tom, the Captain speaks well. Can there be a more needless activity 
than to fill thin air with empty words, unless it is to deliberately spread 
falsehoods in the name of truth? The burden is mine to be proven right and I 
eagerly accept the doubt of others, no matter how heavy that load becomes, for 
when the rightness of my vision comes to pass the transformation of doubts into 
certainties will lift me like a feather on the summer winds!" <P>He ended his speech with arms spread as wide as his beatific smile, and the 
three men now stood at the centre of a loose knot of observers, those on the 
outskirts peering to see what was happening. Aggy stared at the prophet in 
surprise, then turned to the smart mouth. "Is your name really Tom?" he asked. <P>"Yes it is, thank you," came the hurt reply. <P>"I expect it will take more than one good guess to convince you though, won't 
it... Agnotious?" The prophet grinned. <P>"You could have got that from company records," Aggy scoffed, "anyone could." <P>"And it was not prophesy in any case," agreed the prophet. "Perhaps 
something..." His eyes fell closed and the man stood for a moment in silent 
contemplation. The audience shuffled and murmured but Aggy kept his eyes firmly 
on target, not to spot some sleight of hand but because he didn't want to find 
anyone's amusement directed his way, at his expense. The smart mouth - Tom - was 
still flanking him. <P>"Let's go, that train won't drive itself," Aggy muttered finally; but at that 
moment, as if he had been waiting for that very cue, the prophet spoke. <P><p class=drop>Three banks of five monitors <font color=green><b> Suggest 'bathed', giving the sentence an active 
verb  Ed.</b></font> bathing the operators' faces in a blue-green glow as they spoke into 
their headsets, eyes flicking up to scan the huge, information-packed wall 
screen opposite. Above the many windows filled with scrolling text on monitor 
eight was the word "Philadelphia". <P>"The Phillies have secured the signature of promising rookie pitcher Jamie 
Jenkins of the Orioles for a record seventy-five, seven-five, million dollars," 
read the operator, then glanced upwards. "A third minor earthquake in Japan, no 
casualties." Back to the monitor. "Business: shares in Jacobson International 
Plastics rise 26 cents..." <P><p class=drop>" ... And the earth will rise and fall again in a distant land," the young man 
continued. Some of his crowd had drifted but Aggy and Tom were still amongst the 
listeners. The conductor was fidgeting now - they were getting to be actually 
late - but Aggy felt obligated to listen, even against his will. The prophet 
opened his eyes suddenly and looked at him. <P>"Do you invest, Agnotious?" he asked, and Aggy flinched nervously. "A quarter of 
Jacob's sons will rise as well. That's Jay Eye Pee," he added with a wink. The 
young man bowed his head for a moment and when he looked up he also held out a 
soft, colourful, hand-woven bag for donations. Aggy snorted, the spell broken. <P>"You're not getting my change for your old wiffle-waffle," he said, tugging 
Tom's sleeve as he turned away to finish the long walk to his engine, up at the 
distant end of the platform. The long train shone in the sun, a silver thread 
that would snake across the nation and back before sunset, unless he wasted much 
more time. <P>"That's okay, Aggy," the prophet said to his back, a smile on his lips. "There's 
always another day, and change is, you know, inevitable." Aggy snorted again and 
didn't turn. <P>"Oh, and wear a coat tomorrow," the cheerful voice added. "It's going to rain." <P><p class=drop>Thirty-six hours on the road, sort of, it ought to be good to be home. Aggy 
tossed his jacket over the chair back and went for a shower while the cooker 
rayed his dinner. There was more steam in the kitchenette than the bathroom 
cubicle when he emerged, clouding out of the ray-slot like dry-ice at a 
nightclub - have to get that fixed, he thought, again, gingerly pulling the meal 
tray out with a towel to save his fingertips. <P>He sat and flicked the wall for twenty minutes as his meal cooled but there was 
nothing on. Eventually he came to the news band, channel after channel of waving 
flags and action music anthems; boring, boring, bland-business-news-boring, 
boring - he flicked back, peeling his tray and waving away another little cloud 
of steam. On the wall two clones in grey suits with grey hair and grey skin were 
telling the underwear model anchorman how good things looked for the economy. <P>Aggy chewed his Chick-In-Pie and tuned out, staring through the tickertape 
scrolling over the bottom of the screen. GOL, GRD, GWW, HAN, HAR, HEC... ISL. 
Then he paused, eyes tracking right to left until the legend JIP 142.03 +.26 
vanished into the corner of the room behind his Plas-Authen-TicT cactus. <P>There was a clap of thunder outside his bedsit window. "Huh," said Aggy 
absently, as the downpour began. <P>Ten channels over, the weatherman forecast sun. <P><p class=drop>"We're on a three minute count to air, three minutes, count-and-mark -" Beep. <P>The beep sounded from speakers in every room and corridor except the one that 
really mattered. Two men hurried towards that very room, one with fluttery 
little bird steps, the other with the charismatic stride of a person secure in 
his absolute importance. Other corridor users deferred reverentially. <P>"How's the line up?" A voice rich, comforting, trustworthy. Award-winning. <P>"A great line up, just great, Greg, just great -" <P>"I'm not so sure, it felt stale this morning and only the time has changed. Give 
me the run down." <P>"Okay, Greg, of course. Okay: starting with headlines, ad-break, then leading 
with the Presidential Response, expert commentary from Michael Haiyuns, ad-
break, second tier starts with Japan -" <P>"Again? That's the third on the trot, there'll be nothing left of it this time 
next week. It's getting old, shuffle it to the bottom - but keep an ear out in 
case it sinks completely, that we'll go live with. What's next?" <P>"The Rev. John James Faraway shouting down the hellfire about the conflict with 
-" <P>"No, no. He's becoming a clich&#130;, this is no good. And after that?" <P>"Economic super-boom is forecast for -" <P>"Hold it." <P>The two men stopped in the corridor - rather, the tall one stopped, thinking, 
and the other danced back and forth beside him, torn between a crucial 
spiralling lack of time and utter subservience to his master. <P>"Counting two minutes to air, two minutes, count-and-mark -" Beep. <P>"Hold it. Wasn't there something in backup about someone, someone talking, a 
street preacher or something?" He frowned, staring into the middle distance. For 
a moment his aide marvelled at the same crafted lines which presented the 
dazzling illusion of interested focus, regardless of what an interviewee might 
be saying at that moment - then he snapped to it, tapping at his palm board, 
searching the entire mediabase for details of the story. Then he scurried to 
catch up as his boss suddenly strode ahead again. <P>The lift doors at the head of the corridor glided open for them. The taller, 
elegant man checked out his various reflections in the mirrored doors and walls 
as they descended. The palm board chirped. <P>"Okay, I got it: three weeks ago, some guy shows up in Baltimore spouting what 
are described as perfectly accurate predictions on all sorts of topics: local, 
international news; politics, financial, the weather, you name it - and, it 
looks like he's moving around the country, we've got mentions of the same from 
New York, L.A., Boulder, Philly - he's a rover." <P>"Same guy?" Now there was a hint of that smile, that heart stopping charisma. <P>"Good looking, pony-tail, ah... hippy-ish outfit - I guess so." <P>"Right, bump the earthquake coverage to backup and let's take this as a surprise 
second tier between the Pres and the Rev, call it the only man who knows the 
score, watch the networks scramble, eh?" <P>"It'll be great, Greg, fantastic!" <P>"Counting one minute to air, sir, that's just one minute to air, are you -" Beep 
"- on your way, sir?" <P>"Get that new running order to the dee's box now, move it move it." Slipping a 
sliver of plastic from his flawless suit jacket, flicking it open with the 
coolest of flicks. "To: Dan. Don't worry about me, you just make sure things are 
go at your end, okay? New schedule coming to you and you'd better move it move 
it, I'll need something to read straight after the first ad break. Earn your 
bucks, buddy. Send." Coolly flicked closed and slipped away again, he watched 
the gofer hop off down the corridor. Past the door. <P>His door. He opened it. His studio. This psychic thing could be good. His crew. 
It was human, far more so than the usual personality crap, it could run. His 
desk. He sat behind it and blanked his mind. <P>"Count for twenty." Up in the box, the studio director - Dan - glanced around at 
his team and saw everyone in place. At the monitors, all angles covered. Through 
the window and down at the desk, and there he was, settling into his seat and 
ready to go. A door opened and the gofer entered, twitching, holding out his 
board urgently. Dan waved him to a seat and held up five fingers. <P>"Count for ten, synch music, synch vid, prep anchor, up fade and play all for 
five... four... silent..." and... smile... God, he thought. The man's like a 
machine. It's beautiful. <P>"Good evening," said the most handsome and powerful man in the building. "I'm 
Greg Torrent and this, is Channel Pi News." <P><p class=drop>The data centre had grown. Ten rising ranks of monitors, arranged in decreasing 
squares like the layers of a pyramid, twenty on the bottom rows, ten on the top. 
An indoor ziggurat beneath four giant sloping wall screens. Audio baffles muted 
the chatter of neighbouring operators from each other, though the regional 
supervisors sitting in the small lounge on the top of the pile could stream any 
one operators' voice on demand. Mostly they didn't, just keeping one eye on the 
auto-transcripts updating on their lap boards and another on their respective 
donation logs. <P>"They're generous in Australia today," said Oceania. <P>"Good for you," grunted Americas. "There's too much competition for quarters in 
North, what with all the homeless, the unemployed and the church. And in South, 
well, no-one's got anything." <P>"Which is exactly why you guys consistently get the most positive feedback. Put 
a sock in it." <P>Americas grinned. "Yeah, I know." He held out a hand and Africa high-fived it. 
There was a sudden humming followed by a chime, then a section of floor in the 
corner of the lounge rose into the air, opening onto a small elevator. A 
familiar face emerged and smiled at everyone. <P>"Hey hey!" called Americas. "Let me get you a drink. Oh, and: how are the 
prophets?" <P>"I was just about to ask you the same thing!" quipped the prophet, the others 
chiming in with a laugh, as had become ritual. They all got to their feet and 
shook hands in turn. "Seriously, how's tricks?" he asked. <P>Europe dropped back onto the beanbag and tapped at his lap board. "Looking 
pretty good, to be honest. Since the first quarter we've been seeing a steady 
increase across the board - even in the US, not that he'll admit it. If it keeps 
on like this, by the end of the financial we could be running the centre on 
donations alone. Unless you wanted to expand again, of course." <P>"That's the plan. In fact, that's why I'm here. We're about to double - we've 
just finished construction on a second data centre. It's going to handle Asia 
exclusively. It's in Kyoto, and we're going to need experienced brains to get 
things up and running. Ah! From the look on your faces, I'm guessing someone 
kept her secret..." <P>"You complete bitch!" cried Oceania, throwing a cushion at Asia, who batted it 
away with her lap board, giggling. "I knew it, I just knew it!" <P>"Great - we're always looking for someone with a talent for premonition. We were 
thinking, how do you feel about co-heading the new team?" The prophet winced, 
then turned to the others and tried to make himself heard over the chorus of 
delighted squealing. "As for you guys, no big move I'm afraid. But this centre 
becomes dedicated to all the other regions and we will be doubling staff in the 
field. So, you go to senior supervisors and see about sourcing some new guys 
from down there on the slopes, okay?" <P>"You got it, your holiness." Americas gave him a sly, appraising smile. "That's 
the new line now, did you hear?" <P>The prophet sighed theatrically. "Yes, I did, but that was always going to be on 
the cards. It's just a case of waiting and seeing who's the lucky winner." He 
shrugged, then separated Asia and Oceania and slung one arm each around their 
shoulders for a hug. "Come on. Let's have that drink you mentioned." <P><p class=drop>Greg Torrent fixed his audience with his gigawatt gaze and nodded tersely. 
"Welcome back with Channel Pi and, news today of, growing concern about the, 
self-professed prophet sighted, touring the nation. Unconfirmed reports are also 
surfacing, placing him in Mexico, Argentina, several of the former Brazilian 
city states and - although I repeat this is, not confirmed - in the New Russia. 
Here with me we have, Michael Haiyuns of the Dog-Watch-Dog watchdog association 
and, Reverend J. J. Faraway, charismatic preacher and spokesperson for the 
Church of the Intra-Faithual Coalescence. But first we go live to, Hammond 
Strichter on the scene of the, alleged seer's most recent sighting. Hamm?" <P>"Thanks, Greg, I'm here at the -" <P>Torrent mentaled him out and stepped on the quick-cut <font color=green><b> 'pedal', perhaps? Ed.</b></font> 
peddle, silencing his live mic and opening a line to the director's box, while 
activating the CG loop of himself nodding seriously in case of unexpected 
cutaways - the same image which mouthpieced Channel Pi's various 24 hour-a-day 
local or domestic automated news casts. "Are they both in place, Dan?" <P>"Sure thing, Greg, they're in the green booths and ready to go." <P>"They'd better have something poisonous to say. I don't like this story, Dan. 
You know why." <P>"It's a blip, Greg, just a blip, nothing more, nothing to worry about, just a 
blip, seriously, don't get yourself worked up, it's only a blip -" <P>"If you don't stop reassuring me, Dan, you're going to find yourself on the 
fucking street and you can go talk to this asshole direct and ask him what the 
deal is stealing my fucking wind." Dan's voice stopped, but Greg continued 
brooding, oblivious to Strichter's continued babbling in the background. <P>Ratings had dropped. Greg's ratings had never dropped, not one point since he 
took over as anchor, not beyond a plus-minus point-oh-five percent fluctuation 
that could easily be blamed on technical outages. They had always risen. They 
only hit a plateau when the researchers announced there were no more households 
in the civilised world lacking a web feed, and with Channel Pi effectively the 
default information provider for the globe, everyone else in the news industry 
had to scramble to repeat whatever they said was the news. <P>Yet now, a drop. A consistent drop, for over three months... approaching a <font color=green><b> 
'percentage point', perhaps? Ed.</b></font> percent. Not just a drop in Greg's personal 
rating, but also on the artificial feeds. Amongst the mere broadcasters, 
tethered to their pathetic national and regional concerns, it was worse - 
staggering plummets, tens of percents, all over. <P>All because of the damn- <P>"Greg! Greg!" Dan's voice broke though and he blinked. "Wake up! Look at the 
feed! Strichter!" Greg turned to his sub-desk monitor, to where a shaking camera 
POV showed Strichter's meticulously coiffed nape jostling its way through a 
tightly packed crowd. And at their centre, a glimpse of - Him. <P><p class=drop>"I can see him, he's talking!" Strichter's mike buffeted against the bodies of 
the crowd with a mix of annoying unprofessionalism and pleasing authenticity, 
the excitement in his voice much the same. "I'm almost at the front now - excuse 
me, Channel Pi - move!" Strichter broke though into a circle of emptiness 
surrounding the prophet, who paused to look at him what appeared to be an air of 
<font color=green><b>'pleased', perhaps? Ed.</b></font> pleasant surprise. The crowd closed ranks and the 
cameraman failed to join him, having to settle for aiming his lens between their 
heads as best he could. <P>"Hello, Hammond," said the prophet. "How is Greg?" <P>"I'm Ham- Hammond Strichter of Channel Pi news," Strichter barked redundantly. 
Greg scowled. "How do you answer charges today that you are endangering the 
lives of ordinary decent citizens with baseless claims for some kind of 
religiously fundamentalist, er, predictionalism, while extorting money that 
their desperate families need to support themselves in these times of financial 
instability?" Greg brightened. Maybe the man had a future as a reporter after 
all. If they worked on his vocabulary. <P>The prophet smiled benignly and Greg felt himself bristling. "Hammond, I think 
my record for accuracy is spotless, and I ask only for voluntary donations in 
return. Ask anyone here, I'm sure they will agree." There was an outrageous 
murmur of confirmation from all around; then worse, laughter, as the prophet 
added, "In fact, I predict that Mr. Torrent will have something to say about 
this any second now!" <P><p class=drop>Greg stamped on the other <font color=green><b> 'pedal'  Ed.</b></font>peddle under his desk - the feed 
overrider, force cutting back to himself. "Thanks, Hammond. We're back now with 
Mr. Haiyuns and Rev. Faraway, gentlemen, welcome." He stamped on the first <font color=green><b> 
'pedal'  Ed.</b></font> peddle again. "I'm out of here, Dan!" <P>Up in the box Dan and his crew scrambled to connect the appropriate feeds, 
materialising the guests from their booths into the virtual studio opposite 
Greg's desk. "Thank you, Greg," they chorused. <P>"Michael, let me start with you. This prophet: dangerous lunatic or unstable 
victim of his own delusions?" Greg leapt out of his chair without waiting for 
the answer and stormed from the studio, leaving his CG persona to deliver the 
other questions from the script. Neither of his guests, nor his dwindling 
audience share, had the slightest idea. <P><p class=drop>The two men settled into their seats with a sigh. It had been a long day. "How 
was your trip?" <P>"Nice. It's a pretty country, you know, when you can get past all the problems. 
I think we can make a real difference. How are things looking, are we good to 
go?" The other <font color=green><b> I don't think you need 'man' here  Ed.</b></font> man waved at the wall 
beside them and a screen came to life, streams of text and numbers washing up 
and down it. <P>"Better than good. The profits, as you might say, speak for themselves. We don't 
ask for any sum in particular, but the average donation is rising every day. 
People everywhere like this interaction, the personal quality, and they are 
happy to pay for it. The fact that we don't waste time scheduling their 
information for them seems to make all the difference. And there's no adverts, 
of course." <P>"And the projects?" <P>"We've opened eight new junior schools in the last week, four more adult 
education centres, and we're now fully sponsoring over a hundred degree courses 
up to doctorate level. We're outspending two-thirds of the world's states on 
education already. Plus, at this rate of recruitment we'll have to start up a 
fourth data centre before the end of the year, but we can already afford to do 
so without impacting our other developments. Only that one thing left to get the 
snowball really rolling, but I guess we know now. It's going to be America." <P>"Yeah. You owe me a few bucks, pal. Do you know who you want to handle it?" <P>"Actually, I thought I'd do it myself. I don't think I'd feel comfortable giving 
it to anyone else. Besides, I've got a small head, and every little helps." They 
stood up and embraced. <P>"Good luck." <P><p class=drop>"Greg, it's just a - an honour to speak to you!" Greg relaxed into the bodi-form 
chair in his suite and smiled generously. The walls were blank. He spoke into 
his own phone for that intimate touch. <P>"Thanks, Hamm, really - and I just want to say it, I think you've got a great 
future ahead of you." <P>"Oh - I don't - thanks!" <P>"Yeah... if." <P>"If?" Greg didn't reply straight away and could almost hear the cold sweat 
forming on the other end of the line. <P>"Hamm, we've got a real problem with this guy, you know? There are reports, not 
just in the US, but all over now - he's spinning his webs and people are getting 
caught up in them, you know?" <P>"Whoa. That's... that's, like..." <P>"Bad, Hamm." <P>"Yeah. Bad." <P>"I need to know that you're the man to handle this story, Hamm." <P>"I am, Greg, I promise! I've got it covered every way!" <P>"I know you have, Hamm. But listen: as a reporter, and when the time comes, as 
an anchor, it's important to know when to report the news, and when to make it." <P>"...an anchor?" <P>"Sometimes, reporting the news is about saving lives, Hamm." <P>"...yeah." <P>"And sometimes, saving lives means making a real sacrifice. If you know what I 
mean." <P>"I... I do, Greg." <P>"Have you ever been to war, Hamm?" <P>"No." <P>"Well then. All I can say is, when you get that chance for that exclusive, one 
off, final interview - Hamm? Make me proud. Goodbye, son." Greg hung up and 
awarded himself a private Pulitzer for best anchor. <P><p class=drop>"It's been three days since the stunning, alleged murder of the, so-called 
prophet by former Channel Pi news reporter, Hammond Strichter. Later we'll be 
going to the, Bush Secure Psychiatric Prison Facility for a, live interview with 
Strichter himself prior to his, key evaluation at the end of the week - and 
we'll be speaking with the good, Reverend John James about the support he hopes 
to lend to Strichter's cause. <P>"Back after, these messages." Greg smiled perfectly. Ratings had soared. He 
listened to Dan's quiet babbling in his ear, running an eye over the text on his 
backup prompt while he waited for the break to end - <font color=green><b> bit of a repetition 
here: 'then Dan paused. Then Dan said ' - It doesn't feel natural.  Ed.</b></font> then Dan 
paused. Then Dan said something he couldn't make out. Dan's voice sounded... 
bad. <P>"Greg, we've got to come back on right now." <P>"Dan, this is the ad break. We don't interrupt the ad break." <P>"We're going live in five, text on the prompt. Look fucking serious, man." Greg 
didn't have to - interrupting the advert break? The sponsors would kill them 
all, starting with their children. <P>"We interrupt these messages - these extremely important messages," he ad-
libbed, "to go live to... to where..." Greg read it again. "To, to go live-" Dan 
cut him off mid-word, but Greg didn't even notice, just turned immediately to 
his monitor to watch. It was Angela Voney. <P><p class=drop>She had to shout to be heard. "I'm Angela Voney reporting, live at the scene of 
the death of the man they are calling, The Prophet Of Washington D.C. where 
this, massive crowd have gathered to witness, the impossible. Because here, not 
two minutes ago - wait - wait..." Behind her tall blonde bouffant, the crowd was 
quietening. The camera rose, lifting up to look down on their heads - then, from 
the centre, like an expanding ripple on the surface of a pond, the people began 
to sit, right there in the street, spreading towards the outer edge, closer, 
closer, until the only other person standing was - the prophet. <P>Silence. Then he turned once on the spot, slowly, to look out at them all. <P>"The rumours," he said, "of my death are, as they say, not really newsworthy." 
Just for a moment, he seemed to look straight to camera. Then he waved. "So let 
me tell you something that is." He smiled, brilliantly. <P>Back in his studio, a runner of saliva leaked from Greg Torrent's slackly 
hanging jaw onto his tie, unnoticed. <P><p class=drop>The prophet led the newbie - subscriber, pre-convert, whatever; it would please 
the press no end if we called them initiates, he thought - on into the spacious 
lounge, pointing out various features in passing, watching from the amused 
corner of his eye how the youngster stared at some other prophets relaxing and 
chatting and staring peacefully out through the floor-to-ceiling window wall at 
the trees, the grazing animals and the waterfall lake outside. <P>"Nice, isn't it?" he asked. His voice was deep, with just the hint of an accent. <P>"They all look like you," the newbie replied. "I mean, you all look alike. I 
mean, sure, you're black, and some of them are - he's Japanese, look, that one - 
but I never really believed..." <P>"In the much fabled Conversion? That's where we're going now," said the prophet. 
He grinned at the newbie's suddenly wide-eyed expression and stopped walking. 
"Don't worry, kid, it doesn't hurt. We only call it that to give the press a 
shred of truth to hang their paranoia on. It is a part of the deal - everyone 
working in the field has to toe the company line, so to speak - but there's more 
than a little leeway; as you noticed yourself, we embrace all nationalities. 
Take me: I wasn't always the duskily beautiful chocolate god you see before you; 
my mother's side were Norwegian originally. I just really wanted to visit 
Africa, so that's where they sent me. Properly prepared, naturally." <P>"Naturally?" <P>"Well, maybe not," he admitted with another grin. He indicated the way and led 
the newbie out of the lounge and down a clean pale corridor. "But there's no 
questioning the freedom. You get to travel, to see the whole world if you want, 
and you're doing good wherever you go. I've been thinking about a change myself 
recently. Maybe the exotic far east. China would be interesting. Ah, here we 
are." <P>Between a coffee machine and a ceramic drinking fountain was what looked like a 
tanning bed, hip-high beneath an opaquely glowing white domed lid. Just there, 
halfway down a corridor - opposite the door to a unisex toilet. Like it wasn't 
very important. The newbie looked further down the way to a junction, nervously. 
A couple of prophets crossed it; one of them noticed his nervous stare and gave 
him a thumbs up. He looked back to the prophet. <P>"Man, I'm shitting myself a bit." The prophet patted him on the shoulder 
sympathetically. <P>"I know, don't worry. I was too. My whole identity is going away, who will I be, 
oh my god, oh my god! But really, don't worry. It only takes about fifteen 
minutes, it's only cosmetic, and it's entirely reversible. Seriously, I went 
back and forth for two hours when I first joined up, just to make sure it always 
got me right. I used to put my old face back on like clocking off at the end of 
the day; this is just the uniform after all. But after a while, you know. Now I 
only bother if I'm going on holiday. <P>"Look, I'll tell you what: I'm going to be coming out with you while you find 
your feet anyway and I'll have to put my old face back on to blend in. Can't 
have two of us in one place at the same time. Why don't we just give you 
something nice and Apple Pie for now, and when you've got up to speed with the 
spiel and everything we'll both dress up Oriental and go check out the fount of 
civilisation for a few months. How does that sound?" <P>"I don't speak Mandarin." <P>"Wo b&ugrave; xu&eacute; w&uacute; sh&ugrave;," the prophet deadpanned. "Well, we can decide later. Hop on." <P>The newbie did, still nervous, looking about at the narrow compartment as he lay 
back. The prophet started tapping at the controls. As he reached up to close the 
dome the newbie took his arm lightly. <P>"You okay?" the prophet asked. <P>"Yeah, yeah, but..." The newbie swallowed, then squared his jaw. "I'm good. I 
just wanted to say..." He held out his hand to shake. "The name's Thomas. Tom." <P>Aggy smiled and took his hand. "I know," he said. "I remember." <P><small>&copy; Andrew Critchley 2009 All Rights Reserved </small>
