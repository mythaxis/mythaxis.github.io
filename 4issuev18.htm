<div><i>Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good
design for a bus.<br><small>David Hockney</small></i>
<p class=drop>Held in suspension by an unseen balance of forces the
great globe hung low over the linked cluster of buildings in East Snoak.
From a distance its surface appeared perfectly reflective, but closer to
it displayed constantly swirling polychromatic patterns reminiscent of a
soap-bubble.  Every so often, to the delight of spectators, somewhere on
its periphery vagrant trails of colour would coalesce, and a luminous
blob would momentarily detach itself, before dissipating to leave a
slowly fading rainbow glow. <P>Designed by eminent architech Gurm Weiger, this installation was a
tribute to Farny Farglesharp, in celebration of twenty-five years of the
Art Market, which had its humble beginnings in what had once been an
abandoned hut, and now occupied a sprawling network of converted
warehouses set between the outer ring road around Praspafole Stadium and
the fashionably elegant glitter of Yarp Street.  <P><p class=drop>Farny's parents had led busy working lives; his mother
Helba as a
consultant nutritionist, his father Teir as a soil analyst.  These
enlightened practitioners of scientific method did not attempt to impose
a career path on their gawky restless son, who for all his natural
inquisitiveness in his late teens had entered that phase of development
when intelligible communication seemed only permissible among peers.  At
home he spent valuable time contemplating his body-image, cultivating a
look of fierce concentration which closely resembled a defiant scowl,
and responding to polite questions with condensed packets of information
encoded as grunts.  <P>Eventually, out of genuine curiosity rather than rebellion, Farny had
chosen to enrol at Sparagulan College to study Art. He did not think of
himself as an aspiring artist, but had often gravitated to the art books
in his school library, and had definite preferences among the many works
reproduced, although he could not as yet explain why some gave him
pleasure, some left him feeling uncomfortable, while others failed to
leave much impression on him at all.  He knew enough to feel that in
those works that caught his interest there was something akin to a
conjuror's sleight of hand, and he wanted to pry out those secrets. <P>He was also curious to know why so many people devoted their lives to
art, and how exactly did one recognize a masterpiece?  What was it that
distinguished the truly exceptional from the merely highly accomplished?
And who were best qualified to be the arbiters: fellow-artists, cultural
historians, wealthy collectors or the democratic majority? <P>After a year under the tutelage of Lugfaus Goltz, Professorial Head of
the Art Department and a sculptor of some distinction, Farny was
slightly better informed, having acquired a grounding in art history and
techniques, but was more aware than before of the limits of his
knowledge.  In the second year Goltz encouraged his students to
experiment, allowing them to discover for themselves the
transformational potential of solid materials; how easily they could be
carved, moulded, filed, chiselled, glued or welded into a desired shape.
They were asked to examine examples of different rocks and minerals to
determine their artistic potential.  Farny became fascinated by the
chemistry of pigments.  At home, with the benefit of helpful guidance
from the respective disciplines of Teir and Helba, using an array of
powdered and liquefied substances, he worked out for himself how to
create the most satisfying colours. <P>By the end of the third and final year, although the answers to some of
his larger questions remained elusive, Farny Farglesharp thought he
might have found his m&#233;tier.  He had studied the philosophies underlying
successive artistic movements, and could identify the work of their best
exponents.  Professor Goltz had succeeded in teasing out his latent
skills, and if called upon, he could now produce a convincing portrait,
landscape or abstract composition with an implement as rudimentary as a
burnt twig.  He could fashion a themed collage from found objects.  He
had worked with fabrics, wood, clay, glass, metal, stone and artificial
materials, and now had an understanding of the range of tools and
craftsmanship required.  But his real enthusiasm was for the palette;
for the spectrum of paints, inks and dyes which lent richness and
subtlety to the artist's chosen surface. <P><p class=drop>Among his most like-minded college friends was Pirian
Leems, a quietly
studious painter of exquisite miniatures.  Shortly after graduating they
decided to spend some time travelling abroad. Pirian was not only widely
read, but possessed the enviable knack of being able to locate,
seemingly by instinct, the best cuisine and the most stimulating
beverages for the lowest possible price in any given area.  Farny, who
suspected that Pirian possessed a remarkable combination of keen
observation and an acute sense of smell, had casually wondered aloud
whether this vital ability only worked in Snoak, or would it also apply
in foreign parts?  Pirian had risen to the challenge, and they had soon
concluded that there were after all other important reasons for
undertaking such a trip.   With a list of contacts gathered from Farny's
own researches and supplemented by a few names cajoled from Lugfaus
Goltz, together they visited workshops and studios, a host of galleries,
a marine processing plant, an industrial chemist, a spice merchant and
various retailers of craft materials.  Needless to say, Pirian's
tracking aptitude was put to the test, and he unerringly led the way to
a succession of taverns, caf&#233;s, refectories and restaurants of which
Farny had seen no advance notice, and was duly deeply impressed.  Four
months later, brimming with enthusiasm, convivial memories, a wealth of
useful knowledge and such a large quantity of samples they had to invest
in a glidecart, they embarked on their return journey. <P>The hut had belonged to Pirian Leems' grandfather, who had once burdened
its shelves with grey slabs bearing the imprint of cycads, lumps of
stone harbouring ancient trilobites, and other dark, weighty evidence of
long-perished life.  These fossils had been auctioned after his
grandfather's death, as the old man had stipulated, to Pirian's later
financial benefit, although the lad would have been content with his
childhood gift of a small polished ammonite whose chambered helical
geometry had always fascinated him, and which he still cherished.  The
hut had remained empty and abandoned until his friend Farny had
half-jokingly mentioned that he needed somewhere to play with his
pigments, and gradually the idea took shape of a colour laboratory which
could function as a practical enterprise, perhaps even a profitable one.
Farny was confident he could manufacture many of his products more
cheaply than most of those sold commercially, and he could guarantee
their superior quality.  He planned on supplementing his specialist
pigments with a carefully selected range of other art and craft
materials obtained at a discount from reputable suppliers. <P>Pirian was happy to spend some of what he called his "fossil fund" on
refurbishing the hut.  He had it virtually rebuilt, with the addition of
plumbing facilities, light-sensitive windows and
thermostatically-controlled storage containers, and had ordered a few
items of automated equipment "&#133;to lessen the chance of injury and to
reduce unnecessary mess," as he explained.  Grimy and dishevelled after
sorting and bundling a fresh batch of willow charcoal, Farny conceded
that he was willing to make sensible compromises.  As a mutually agreed
afterthought, at the back they added an extended porch or corridor which
served as a gallery in which to display and sell on commission the best
work they could find by promising artists in any medium.  This section
initially housed some of Pirian's miniatures and a bronze entitled
<i>Frogsplash 2</i>, generously donated by Lugfaus Goltz. <P>After a further six weeks of preparation Farny and Pirian began
advertising the Art Hut. The College magazine <i>Splark!</i> ran a
full-page
feature, and they distributed handouts and placed posters on notice
boards in as many of Snoak's public places as would have them, and even
along a few random thoroughfares like 20bird Lane, The Scruttings and
Upper Stirrow Bridge.  The offer of free samples to the first fifty
visitors was a bit of a gamble, but paid dividends by attracting not
only the anticipated groups of college students, but also the curiosity
and admiration of a few people with a professional interest and greater
spending power. <P>Within a year the Art Hut had an established client&#232;le, regular orders
from several studios and educational institutions (including Sparagulan
College), and was ready to start expanding.  Pirian's miniatures were
selling well, and other painters and sculptors whose work they both
respected were seeking gallery space, including the Post-Prandialist
Irkel Upquap, then at work on progressively more convoluted versions of
his looping structures in polished metal: brightly interweaving ribbons
varying in thickness from that of a spoon handle to the girth of a human
torso.  The sculptor described these as 'experiments in non-contiguous
spatial dynamics', although one unkind critic said the effect was of a
roller-coaster being digested by a drunken snake. Another interested
potential exhibitor was the young Tortica Doublebud, already notorious
for her innovative series of interactive metaportraits, where the
sensation of eyes following you around the room was manifested in ways
that some found physically intrusive. <P>Over the next few years Farny and Pirian negotiated with Commercial
Planning at Central over the acquisition and conversion of the nearby
derelict buildings, formerly transport depots before the advent of
freightway and podport.  Once reconstruction was satisfactorily in
progress they set about recruiting additional staff.  There was no
shortage of applicants from the College, both among students seeking
part-time work and among recent graduates.  Pirian, who had often wished
to devote more time to his painting, gradually withdrew from direct
participation in the business.  It was he who suggested that the complex
should be renamed Farglesharp's Art Market in honour of Farny's
extraordinary commitment and enterprise. <P>By the time the largest of the former depots was approved for
renovation, Farny had agreed to sponsor a College competition for the
best design, the only specification being that the building was to be
used primarily as a display space for works both two-and
three-dimensional.  The students' entries ranged from the
uncomplicatedly minimalist (internal space left totally empty) to the
seriously expensive (sliding walls, retractable ramps, adjustable stair
units, mobile plinths, anacoustic recesses, variable glow chambers,
modular formstax, Trovius cabinets and motion-activated hotos).  The
winning design, awarded a cash prize and a generous gift box of art
materials, was a sensible compromise between optimal natural light and
stylishly discreet toilet facilities. <P>The finished building became the venue for some memorable exhibitions:
Kreft Nuyl's monumental <i>Sailstones</i>, whose appearance belied their
true fragility, the magnificent <i>Black Fire</i> tapestries of Tosmor
Shaunt, and the <i>Hundred Hidden Doors</i>, that tantalizingly
labyrinthine creation of Hirelle Degdard, from which bemused spectators
would emerge in a trance-like state, having lost all sense of time,
place and direction.  The artist herself modestly declined to be
interviewed, stating only that she would like her work to speak for
itself.  This did not prevent critics from offering their own
interpretations, but the consensus was that moving through the gauzy
intricacy of this structure was a unique and mysterious experience.
Lurid reports appeared in the Quanderpyre Press alleging that two people
wearing short cloaks and thought to be from Smatparrox had actually
failed to re-appear after entering this exhibit, but these reports were
never substantiated.  The two people were not identified, although Ebby
Blates at the Multimart was overheard saying that she wouldn't be
surprised if they turned out to be those two arty friends of her second
husband's cousin Zole. <P><p class=drop>Curiously enough, at about that time there seemed to have
been a spate
of rumours about people from Smatparrox going missing, but it took more
than uncorroborated gossip to disturb the equanimity of Snoak City
residents, hardly any of whom are likely to have known either of the two
acquaintances of Ebby Blates' husband's cousin.  These two currently
unemployed Smatparrox-based individuals were in fact Fucis Gawl and
Legger Rambersack, who shared the slight distinction of having had a few
dyspeptic poems published in local hand-printed magazines with
(numerically) a very modest readership.  To assert their dedication to
the muse they had taken to wearing cravats, silk-lined capes and
wide-brimmed black hats in an emulous attempt to revive what they
believed was a once fashionable literary tradition, but most people
assumed they had been hired to perform tricks at a children's party.  As
it happened, at the time of the alleged vanishing among the <i>Hundred
Hidden Doors</i> they were on home ground, sitting at their habitual
table in Quoil's, having an intensely heated argument about boiled eggs;
specifically, whether a boiled egg with its shell removed is more
correctly described as 'shelled' or 'unshelled'.  They both passionately
believed that such debates about the nuances of language could only
enhance their development as poets.  If Farny Farglesharp can achieve
public recognition in only a quarter of a century, who is to say that
the names of Gawl and Rambersack may not yet be honoured by posterity? <P>
