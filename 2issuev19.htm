<div align=center><img src="interlude.png"><BR><h2>Interlude in Green</h2><BR><h3>Martin M. Clark</h3><BR></div>
<div><i><b>Life is filled with little surprises.</b></i>
<p class=drop>There was no up, no down, no sideways. I
was on the ground, in the air, under water. A kaleidoscope of sight and
sound. Audio-visual bedlam, big screen, guaranteed front-row seat.</p> <P><p>The hit from a neural disruptor is like deleting the master index to
your memory. Everything is out of context; there&#146;s no timeline, no sense
of immediacy, no perspective. It lasted a few seconds, a year, or
somewhere in-between.</p> <P><p><i>Blink.</i></p> <P><p>I was sitting on the ground, my back against a landing strut.
It was a lush, green landscape with long shadows. Late
afternoon. A woman stood a short distance away, looking out at
the crops beyond the line of an irrigation canal. Apart from
that, there was no sign of civilisation.</p> <P><p>Diana Ostov.</p> <P><p>She was a heavy-ass brunette in her mid-twenties, handsome
rather than pretty. An entirely sexist and superficial
appreciation I admit, but my forebrain was still getting its act
together and, well, she ticked all the boxes.</p> <P><p>I found my voice. &#147;Where are we?&#148;</p> <P><p>She didn&#146;t look in my direction. &#147;Permian Major, apparently.&#148;</p> <P><p>I tried to place it and failed. &#147;Ah, which system?&#148;</p>
	    
<p>&#147;The Canids Cluster.&#148;</p> <P><p>Still nothing. &#147;Why? What are we doing here?&#148;</p> <P><p>A male voice. &#147;That would be my idea, bud.&#148;</p> <P><p>I turned my head. A man was walking down the access ramp from the
ship. He carried a pistol, but casually; more as a Rim mercenary fashion
accessory than naked threat. His name was Bloon. He was a pilot, this
was his ship. I&#146;d hired him. </p> <P><p>I move people from place to place. People who don&#146;t want to go
through formal channels. People like Diana Ostov. The Primacy was a
closed society, one of those who knew they were right and the rest of
the universe was wrong. All those who worked at the isolated starport
were morally suspect, if only by association. </p> <P><p>Diana wanted out and had sufficient funds to make my involvement
worthwhile. It helps that I&#146;m an empath, officially a strong Level Two.
In reality I&#146;m an unregistered Three, capable of twisting perspective in
others without the need for a broadcast unit. So I&#146;d walked her to the
ship while starport security ignored us; easy in, easy out. </p> <P><p>A simple plan, executed cleanly, with no complications &#150; until
now.</p> 
		 
<p>Bloon gestured with his gun. &#147;Before you even think about trying any
mind-games, Klein, have a feel at the back of your head. Slowly,
now.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I did as he suggested, slowly. There was a hemispherical metal disk
stuck to my skull.</p>
		 
<p>The pilot squatted down beside me. &#147;That there is a shaped charge
with an anti-handling trigger. It&#146;s also linked to my EEG monitor and
biometric feed. Meaning that if I flatline or my vitals tank then that
tricksy brain of yours gets blown out your eye sockets. We understand
each other?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I nodded. Slowly. &#147;Absolutely.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>He grinned. &#147;Outstanding. Now, me and the girl will be leaving in due
course. Don&#146;t do anything stupid and you get to wave us good-bye.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;What, you <i>really</i> think the Primacy will pay for her return?
Wise-up, man, they&#146;ll burn you alive as a heretic and dismember her as
irredeemably contaminated.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Bloon laughed. &#147;Take her back? Hell, no. Diana has corporate
value.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I frowned. &#147;You jazzed or something? She was born there and this is
her first time off-world. How can she be worth anything to anyone? No
offence, Diana.&#148; </p>
		 
<p>The pilot stood up. &#147;I ran her DNA as soon as she came aboard. Turns
out she&#146;s the daughter of one Joseph Ostov, a corporate defector. He was
an indentured geneticist with HanaMed back in the day, one of their
brightest stars, until he vanished without trace.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;My father? You&#146;re looking for my father?&#148; Diana stepped closer, &#147;But
he died, almost five years ago.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;There goes your leverage, Bloon.&#148; I got to my feet and dusted myself
down, &#147;Busted flush.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Bloon shook his head. &#147;You weren&#146;t listening. As an <i>indentured</i>
employee that means everything he produced is the property of HanaMed
Industries. Including the little lady here.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Diana sounded more confused than angry. &#147;I&#146;m not an object that my
father <i>produced</i>. I&#146;m not just something that can be
<i>owned</i>.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Bloon winked at her. &#147;Sure you are. Almost a third of the population
out on the Rim are obligated to some power or another. Oh, we don&#146;t call
it slavery these days but it amounts to the same thing. I have a broker
sounding out HanaMed right now to see if you&#146;re worth nixing my
agreement with Klein.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I really didn&#146;t like the implications of that. &#147;And if they don&#146;t
bite, then what?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Then we go back to Plan &#145;A&#146;. I drop you both off at Nebula Gateway
and you pay me the half-later part of our contract.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Just like that? No hard feelings?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>He shrugged. &#147;It&#146;s only business. Now, play nice and this will soon
be over.&#148; Bloon holstered his gun and ambled away, towards the
canal.</p>
		 
<p>Diana and I looked at each other. I wiped my mouth. &#147;Did your father
continue his work after he joined the Primacy? Did he experiment on you
at all?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>She shivered. &#147;No, no, nothing like that. He was a pharmacist,
dealing with locally produced remedies. There was maybe one odd thing,
now I come to think of it.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Uh-huh?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;He called me his greatest creation, for as long as I can remember. I
always assumed it was just a figure of speech, a term of endearment, but
now&#133;&#148; Her voice trailed away and I could see concern in her grey
eyes.</p>
		 
<p>I took a deep breath and released it slowly. &#147;OK, so Papa Orlov is on
the run and needs a place to hide. But the Primacy are based on
religious eugenics, they wouldn&#146;t accept an outsider unless his genetic
makeup was perfect, I mean flawless. It can&#146;t just be a happy
coincidence&#133;&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Well, I was tested at birth, everyone is. My mother was just a Beta
but I&#146;m rated an Alpha.&#148; She couldn&#146;t hide the pride in her voice. </p>
		 
<p>&#147;Forget tinkering with gene therapy. I think your father not only
found a way to wipe the slate clean, he passed that ability on as an
inherited trait.&#148; A sudden thought made me frown, &#147;Shit, how did he
die?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>She stiffened. &#147;What? Ah, he was helping a neighbour cut down a tree
and it fell the wrong way, crushing them both. Why is that
important?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Sorry, but an accidental death is just fine. Something like cancer
or liver disease would blow my theory out of the water.&#148; I ran fingers
across my stubble, &#147;But if Bloon has forwarded your DNA to HanaMed for
confirmation, then we&#146;re screwed. You&#146;ll become a glorified lab-rat
while
I end up as landfill.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Dead? But he said if you didn&#146;t cause trouble then you&#146;d be left
here, unharmed.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Yeah, right. Someone like Bloon can&#146;t screw a client and leave them
looking for payback. No, if this goes bad then it goes bad
big-time.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Diane stared at me for a long moment, chewing her bottom lip in an
incredibly fetching fashion. I never mix business with pleasure but in a
different time and place &#150; who knows?</p> <P><p>She frowned. &#147;You&#146;re an empath. Are you sure you
can&#146;t tweak
him,
just a little? If HanaMed <i>do</i> offer to pay, then I'm guessing they
won't offer much, in case Bloon thinks I might be worth even more and
tries to sell me on the open market. Can&#146;t you make him suspicious of
HanaMed's intentions, even paranoid, so that he goes for your agreed
pay-off instead?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#147;Normally, yes, I could make him my best
friend forever, or at least until everything was done and dusted.
However, as things stand&#133;&#148; I gestured towards the back of my head, &#147;&#133; he
<i>could</i> be bluffing, but I&#146;m not exactly keen to find out.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>For a moment her whole demeanour changed, like she&#146;d been keeping
No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy bottled up until he&#146;d <i>really</i> had enough. The
look in her eyes was enough to shrivel any amorous thoughts I might have
been harbouring. Not just figuratively.</p>
		 
<p>She tossed her hair back. &#147;I have a way out of this. Do you trust
me?&#148;</p> 
		 
<p>&#147;Depends. Does it involve me going <i> mano a mano</i> with Bloon
while you
cheer from the side-lines?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;You won&#146;t even have to lift a finger.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I managed a semi-rakish grin. &#147;Then count me in. What&#146;s the
plan?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Just go over and talk to him. Appeal to his better nature.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Huh?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Humour me, I think you&#146;ll be surprised at the outcome.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I put on as much swagger as I could muster, given the circumstances,
and headed over to where the pilot was standing, gazing down at the
irrigation canal. Diana kept pace close behind me. Bloon was a big man
and I really didn&#146;t fancy my chances if this ended in a fight, despite
her assurances.</p>
		 
<p>He turned to face me. &#147;I haven&#146;t heard anything as yet, so try and
chill out.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Diana touched the back of my neck. </p>
		 
<p>My balls felt like a cold hand had just cupped them, making me
gasp.</p>
		 
<p>The world snapped shut and opened again.</p>
		 
<p>I dropped maybe 15 centimetres and stumbled.</p>
		 
<p>There was a small explosion behind me; a flat bang with no echo.</p>
		 
<p>I fell, sprawling on long, coarse grass. </p>
		 
<p>I was naked.</p>
		 
<p>The rational part of my brain took a time-out so the instinctive me
bounced back up and stared around, trying to make sense of things.</p>
		 
<p>Bloon toppled backwards into the canal, his upper torso a bloody
mass. I was on the opposite bank from where I&#146;d been standing only
moments ago &#150; over 10 metres away.</p>
		 
<p>Diana raised her voice. &#147;You make it OK?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I covered my groin with both hands. &#147;Yeah, well&#133;&#148; I took a deep
breath. &#147;What the hell just happened? The simple version!&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;My father dubbed it &#145;displacement&#146;. However it only affects organic
matter, not your clothes &#150; or Bloon&#146;s shaped charge.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Inbuilt teleportation? Jesus - but how the hell did you get that
past the ship&#146;s scanners? Or generate enough energy?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Teleportation? No, nothing so crude. Every planet is awash in dark
energy that most man-made systems can&#146;t detect. I simply displaced your
molecular make up and background wash carried you across the canal in
the time taken for the effect to wear off.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Her matter-of-fact tone was more disturbing than a crazed rant. &#147;Uh,
don&#146;t take this the wrong way, Diana, but what the <i>fuck</i> are you
on about? Some magical power whisked me to safety, leaving Bloon to get
his face blown off? What&#146;s next, we escape on the back of a bejewelled
star dragon? Because without a pilot that ship is going nowhere.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>She laughed. &#147;Then how about neural control of sticky neutrinos,
Klein, does <i>that</i> make more sense? Bloon scanned for electronic
implants, not bio-electrical signatures or organic abnormalities. My
body is a living powerhouse capable of dark matter manipulation. I could
probably run that entire ship of his without breaking sweat.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Jesus, girl, do you have any idea what that kind of technology is
worth? Look, I know people - patent lawyers, private security, corporate
brokers &#150; who can put together a primo deal. Cast iron, one that even
the Devil himself couldn&#146;t dent.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;For a percentage, of course? You sound just like my father, except
the deal would be his and I&#146;d just be his proof of concept. All he was
waiting for was my new organs to mature fully.&#148; The bitterness in her
voice was obvious.</p>
		 
<p>I experienced a sudden moment of clarity. &#147;You murdered him.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;I placed my hand on the tree trunk and it fell as I wished.
Although,
good luck explaining that to a Magistrate.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Not a chance - your business is your business.&#148; I looked to left and
right. The waterway stretched away in both directions with no visible
crossing point. &#147;OK, so how do I get back across?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>She smiled. &#147;You don&#146;t.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Excuse me?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Sorry, Klein, but you&#146;re on your own from now on.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Look, Diana, without the ship I think we&#146;d stand a far better chance
of getting off this world if we stick together.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Actually, no.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I blinked. &#147;No?&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;I can fly the Delta, or at least let it fly itself. All I have to do
is sit back and enjoy the ride.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>I tried not to sound relieved. &#147;Ah, sorry to point out the obvious,
but the ship is in lock-down. The controls are keyed to Bloon&#146;s
bio-signature, and his alone.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>Diana shook her head. &#147;I screwed the hired help while you were
unconscious. He even enjoyed having his back clawed while I harvested
sufficient skin cells to coat my right palm.&#148; She smiled. &#147;So, no, I
don&#146;t believe the geno-lock will pose a problem.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;But you can&#146;t just leave me here like this!&#148; It was hard not to
whine.</p>
		 
<p>&#147;Why not? It was Bloon I wanted out of the way and your survival was
just a by-product. Displacement timing is more art than science and you
could just as easily have ended up in the canal.&#148;</p>
		 
<p>&#147;You need me, Diana. You don&#146;t know Rim society, you don&#146;t know how
to survive out here.&#148; </p>
		 
<p>&#147;Oh, your contacts aboard Nebula Gateway would make life easier, I
admit, but I&#146;ll get by. So long, Klein. Don&#146;t come looking for me.&#148; She
turned on her heel and strode away, up the access ramp and into the
ship. I tried to reach out but my brain was still on the fritz and her
mind was a like a smooth ball-bearing; cold and impenetrable.</p>
		 
<p>The access ramp swung shut and the engines began to power up. The
Delta used VTOL technology rather than an anti-grav lifting field. It
rose slowly into the air, down-blast blowing my abandoned clothes into
the water where they sank without trace. The landing struts retracted as
the ship moved forward, gaining speed. Part of me still hoped that Diana
would circle around and set down on my side of the canal, a big &#145;Gotcha&#146;
grin on her face as she welcomed me aboard.</p>
		 
<p>The nose lifted and the Delta accelerated away into the clear blue
sky, rapidly dwindling to a speck, a pinpoint, a figment of my
imagination.</p>
		 
<p>I heard a faint sonic boom.</p>
		 
<p>A breeze rustled the grass, water gurgled in the canal, the sound of
my own breathing. No birdsong, no insects, no distant hum of machinery.
I shivered and wiped sweat from my brow, then started walking alongside
the canal. I figured I&#146;d find a pump or sluice gates - something I could
shut down so that a repair team would be sent to investigate. Hell, I&#146;d
settle for a drone as long as I could attract its attention. As plans go
it sucked but I was out of options. </p>
		 
<p>Sometimes life pisses on you and tells you its raining.</p>
		 
<p>I just wished I&#146;d brought an umbrella.</p>
