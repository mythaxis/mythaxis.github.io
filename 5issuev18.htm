<div><i>Just what makes that little old ant<br> Think he'll move that
rubber tree plant<br> Anyone knows an ant, can't<br>Move a rubber tree
plant.<br><small>Lyrics of High Hopes &#169; BARTON MUSIC CORPORATION
</small></i>
<p class=drop> The truck's suspension was so effective it
felt like sitting in a small, canopied aerodrome rather than the back of
an armoured vehicle. Jacob watched the briefing. He'd aged a lot in the
last fourteen months. He hesitated to say 'hardened'--it was too close
to what he'd done to the ants. </p> <p> <P><i>From myrmecologist to miscreationist.</i> </p> <p> <P>Scientists, doctors had always hidden their work behind a wall of Latin
names. It was why Harrison had been brought in by the P.R. department to
deliver today's briefing. </p> <p> <P><i>"'Roy boss?'"</i> asked one of the marines, or whatever soldiers
called themselves these days. The scientific briefing was part of their
orientation, given in order to explain some of the equipment the marines
would be carrying into battle when they arrived at the fields. </p> <p> <P>"<i>Rooibos</i>," Harrison corrected. "It's a type of South African tea.
A while ago, a fellow called Nortier had the job of trying to cultivate
the plant in order to increase production but found that the seeds were
tiny and that, when ripe, the seedpods burst them all over the place.
Then a local Khoi woman showed him how the resident black ants collected
up the seeds and stored them in their nests. Hey presto: automated seed
collection. </p> <p>
 "More
recently, the same method had been extrapolated in order to have ants
collect something more valuable." Harrison looked his way, but Jacob
already had his game-face on. "They persuaded ants to collect gold and
silver deposits and bring them back to their nests where the metals
could then be harvested. Think of it like bees collecting minute
particles of pollen that eventually give us honey." </p> <p>
 <i>Or
oysters turning grains of sand into pearls</i>, thought Jacob at the
inaccurate comparison. It didn't matter: as long as the men in the truck
knew they weren't here to rescue civilians but silos. </p> <p>
 "And
it worked&#8230;" </p> <p>
 <i>We
wouldn't be here if it hadn't.</i> But sometimes you could be too
clever, and sometimes things could work too well&#8230; </p> <p>
 "The
company used pheromones to direct the ants to collect metal deposits and
rewarded them with foodstuffs to instil the right behaviour. The
ants' own tandem-learning instilled the behaviour throughout the nest.
Unlike seed collection, there are no seasonal restraints, and so the
ants keep stockpiling the whole year round. The company had to mix many
different strains to get just the ant they wanted. The resultant
mutant&#8230;" </p> <p> <P>--<i>One man's mutant is another man's superhero</i>, Jacob thought.
Although, granted, no one had ever put a cape on Doc Frankenstein's
creation-- </p> <p> <P>"&#8230;was a metal-collector extraordinaire." </p> <p>
 And
now the monster story took its inevitable downturn. </p> <p> <P>"Unfortunately, the ants had other ideas-they didn't want to give up
what they'd collected." </p> <p>
 "What
does an ant want with gold?" a marine asked. </p> <p>
 "It
wasn't just gold they ended up collecting. They got a taste for metal.
Not to eat it-they're not stupid--they used it to reinforce their nests
and turn them into little, armoured Fort Knoxes." </p> <p>
 "Why
are <i>we</i> here? Why not just send in pest exterminators?" </p> <p>
 "Tell
them," Jacob said when Harrison faltered. </p> <p> <P>"Because ants protect what's theirs. Come here, Kenner." A marine more
laden down with bits and pieces than a husband accompanying his wife to
the spring sales stepped forward. There were grunts of amusement. The
explanation of Kenner's equipment would run like the safety procedures
delivered by a flight attendant prior to take-off. </p> <p>
 "The
ants use chemical warfare, so you need to keep your bio suit on at all
times. Some species of ants use propaganda pheromones which can cause
their enemies to turn and attack each other&#8230;" </p> <p>
<i>Polyergus rufescens</i> , Jacob thought. " </p> <p> Or acetophenones
to immobilise an enemy." <i>Malaysian capmonotus cylindricus. </i>"They
can even release oleic acid to encourage necrophoric behaviour." <i>Atta
mexicana.</i> </p> <p>
 There
was a dirty laugh. </p> <p>
 "It
means removal of their dead. They keep their homes clean. Their chemical
agents include formic acid..." <i>Formicinae</i>. "&#8230;alkaloids and
piperidines." <i>Solenopsis fire ants</i>. "The ants, gentlemen, are
fighting back." </p> <p> Jacob was impressed that Harrison held the
men's gazes after that B-Movie tagline Jacob nodded for the briefing to
continue. </p> <p>
 "Ants
are master architects. But, apart from reinforcing their nests, there
are unconfirmed rumours this new breed are also reinforcing their
exoskeletons. They bite, they sting, they spray, and they inject."
Bottoms shifted uncomfortably in their seats. It was about time. Jacob
leaned forward, anticipating the inevitable round of home remedies. </p>
<p> 
"Why don't we just flood the fields and drown them?" </p> <p>
 "Some
ants switch to anaerobic respiration underwater." <i>Camponotus
anderseni.</i> "Some even go so far as to drink the water in the nest,
then excrete it outside." <i>Cataulacus muticus. </i> </p> <p>
 The
thing with mixing the breeds was you got all the features you
wanted&#8230;and forgot about the shared features you didn't. </p> <p> <P>"Couldn't we just starve them out?" </p> <p>
 "They
can grow their own food supply." <i>Fungus-growing leafcutter ants</i>.
"They even farm their own livestock." <i>Mealy bugs </i>and<i>
myrmecophilous caterpillars</i> being the cattle of choice. </p> <p>
 Hell,
<i>Protomognathus americanus</i> even caught and kept their own slaves.
</p> <p>
 "What
about a great big magnifying glance and a hot sun?" one wag said in
order to lighten the mood. Jacob joined in with the laughter until some
other marine said, "Why don't we just drop a bomb on the entire damned
field?" </p> <p>
 Jacob
stood up and made sure he could be seen. "Because the value of that
field is in excess of the gross national product of a middle-sized
European economy. You shall therefore be going in with a new spray which
will neutralise the threat, but preserve the assets. Any questions?"
</p> <p>
 Jacob
saw the wide-eyes of the marines as they backed up, pointing at
something behind him. He turned in time to see the rest of Harrison
dissolve into the billions of ants that had formerly made him. </p> <p> <P><i>Myrmarachne plataleoides</i>, Jacob thought as they raced up
his legs. One more trick. The ability to mimic their enemies. </p> <p>
