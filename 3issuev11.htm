<div><i>Not to be confused with the Legend of <I>Red-beard and the
Chiming Bones</I>. Oh, no.</i>
<p class=drop>The natives of the Micronesian island of
Tao'kaua sometimes tell their children the legend of <I>The Jellyfish
Who Tried to Eat the Stars</I>.  It is one of many cautionary tales they
have up their sleeve to instil respect, discourage foolhardiness, and,
as a good friend of mine once eloquently put it, 'knock some of the
greth out of the little bastards.'  As a morally instructive example,
<I>The Jellyfish Who Tried to Eat the Stars</I> is about as effective as
<I>The Snake Who Lost the Moon</I>, or <I>The More and More Bird</I>.
As a result, the children of Tao'kaua tend to retain much of their
greth, and are obliged, like the rest of us, to learn from their own
mistakes.</P>
<P>One such mistake was made by Dundro Fappit, a native not of Tao'kaua,
of which hardly anyone has heard, but of Snoak City, half a world away.
For at least five generations Fappits had been makers of musical
instruments.  Back in the days of Tuddy and Larsha, Dundro's
great-great-grandparents, the family had provided bespoke instruments
for the leading musicians of the day, including the great Horum Pan and
the multi-talented Winivrel Flixx.  These days the clients were less
world-renowned, but no less demanding.</P>
<P>In the Fappit workshop, the sweet tang of freshly pared wood mingled
with sharp epoxy resin, steam, heated metal and varnish.  Partially
completed instruments were held in clamps, or supported by sturdy
armatures.  A multitude of specialised tools hung neatly from labelled
hooks on the walls.  Some were in use by apprentices under the close
supervision of Dundro's brothers, Rerp and Sullit.  Lathes purred and
buzzed, suction ducts whirred, preventing much of the sawdust and fine
shavings of maple, sycamore, ash and cherrywood from drifting to the
floor.  Behind the closed door of the adjoining office sat Dundro
Fappit, gazing dolefully at a slightly chipped pyramidal glass
paperweight on his paper-free desk, and contemplating his mistake.</P>
<P>Aurelian 3rdfield, fond, neglectful father of Paeony, stood at the
window of his studio, staring down past the iridescent office towers,
the shopping complex with its sinuous black and silver roofscape, and
the distant parkland, to where the river looped towards a hazy horizon.
He was humming.  It was a tenor hum of great refinement and musicality,
the product of natural talent and a considerable amount of training.  In
his early years he had studied theory and composition, practiced his
scales, sung in a choir, mastered harmony, counterpoint and rhythm.  He
explored the many different traditions, favouring baroque and classical,
but finding delight and even occasional profundity among more recent
compositions. </P>
<P>He had himself written pieces for voice and a variety of instruments,
as well as some purely choral works, and had just completed his latest
commission: a sonata for flute, violin and varp (the erstwhile
vibraharp).  He was humming, with immodest satisfaction, the poignant
coda from the final movement.  His sonata was shortly due to have its
first public performance, courtesy of Quicksilver Promotions and
Sparagulan College.  It pleased Aurelian greatly to know that it was to
be performed by three outstanding musicians; the venerable violinist
Dizmin Harf, the irrepressible young flautist Tiril Elkfreen, and
seemingly ageless varpist Slath Croblin, remembered by many a jazz
aficionado.  Rehearsals had gone well, and the acoustics at Sparagulan
College auditorium were of course perfect.  He looked forward to the
concert with proprietorial excitement.</P>
<P>Dundro Fappit suddenly realised his e-screen had been flashing
importunately for some time.  Even before responding, he knew who it
would be, and tried desperately to gather his wits.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, Maestro, what a pleasure to hear from you!&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Is it ready yet?&quot; demanded Dizmin Harf, clearly unwilling
to waste time with pleasantries.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, there are a few minor adjustments to be made to the
bridge, and one or two&#133;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are aware,&quot; interrupted Harf, &quot;that it was
promised for last week, and that the concert is now imminent?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My profuse apologies, Maestro.  I will have it delivered to you
within 48 hours at the very most, and naturally we will waive any
delivery charges.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Pfah to your charges!  You have 24 hours, Fappit.  Otherwise I
will sue you.&quot;  The screen went blank.  Fappit stared at the
blankness.  It stared back at him, refusing to blink first.</P>
<P>In the workshop, Sullit, Rerp and the apprentices failed to hear his
spontaneous string of interesting expletives above their industrious
whirring, tapping and scraping, but minutes later the office door
opened, and Dundro emerged, looking unusually pale and determined.  He
stood in the doorway holding a very fine-looking violin.  It appeared to
glow with an inner grace.  Its burnished elegance sang, albeit silently,
of a lifetime of attentive care.  Its taut strings yearned for the soft
caress of a masterful bow.  The nearest craftsmen
had turned to look at Dundro, who gestured that he wanted everyone&#146;s
attention.  With a diminishing whine, lathes were powered down, and
tools temporarily laid to rest.  Dundro held up the violin.</P>
<P>&quot;You all know whose this is, &quot; he stated.  They nodded.
The unmistakeable quality of Dizmin Harf&#146;s precious instrument was equal
to the best of the old Italian masters.  They knew that Dundro had
personally undertaken to check it for any imperfections before the
forthcoming concert.  Dundro turned the violin so that they could see
its back.  There was a communal gasp at the sight of the slightly ragged
small square hole.</P>
<P>&quot;It was an accident,&quot; explained Dundro, &quot;but it was
entirely my fault.  The instrument was on my desk, and its neck caught
on my sleeve as I turned to reach for a clean polishing cloth.  I tried
to catch it as it fell, but as I did so I knocked my paperweight to the
floor, and by an unlucky chance the violin dropped on top of it.  I have
been too ashamed to confess this to the Maestro, and until now, even to
you.&quot;  Dundro was close to tears.  &quot;But he must have it by
tomorrow, or I am ruined.&quot;</P>
<P>Sullit stepped forward and gently took the violin from him.  &quot;We
are professionals, brother,&quot; he said.  &quot;And in a crisis such
as this we pull together.  Is that not so?&quot;  His fellow craftsmen
agreed.  &quot;We will put everything else on hold,&quot; added Rerp,
&quot;and concentrate on restoring this magnificent fiddle.  Come,
Dundro, let us make measurements.  Sullit, you must match the veneers.
The rest of you, prepare a working area.&quot;  Activity resumed in the
Fappit workshop.  Tuddy and Larsha would have been proud of this scene
of quiet efficiency and minute attention to detail, and probably amazed
at the rapidity with which these new-fangled glues and varnishes could
be made to dry.  In their day the temperamental clients, however
distinguished, simply had to  be patient.</P>
<P>Dizmin Harf&#146;s violin was delivered in perfect condition the following
morning.  He was less grumpy than expected, because Tiril Elkfreen,
whose company he rather enjoyed, had come round to discuss some of the
3rdfield sonata&#146;s musical nuances.  The performance duly took place at
the appointed time in the Sparagulum auditorium, and was deemed to be an
enormous success.  Aurelian 3rdfield&#146;s reputation was enhanced, and
further commissions were bound to follow.</P>
<P>A few members of the audience wondered why Slath Croblin, though
undoubtedly a fine musician, needed to hunch over his varp like a
predatory vulture, but that had always been his habit.  It brings to
mind the legend of <I>Red-beard and the Chiming Bones</I>, but the
details escape me.</P> <P><small>&copy; L J Sklaroff 2012 All Rights Reserved </small>
