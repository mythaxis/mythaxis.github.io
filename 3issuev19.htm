<p class="drop"><p>&#147;We can see the ghosts, but they can&#146;t
see us?&#148; Manuel asked. The guide, a tall Argentine called Alvaro, had
already been shooting glances at Manuel during the tour. Now, he smiled
perfect teeth and said:</p>
	    
<p>&#147;Oh, yes. They can see us.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;I&#146;m glad I did my hair, then,&#148; Manuel said, flicking his curls back,
relieved that Alvaro was taking the touch of camp the wrong way. Natalia
was in a bad mood, hadn&#146;t wanted to take the <i>Past-times Walk</i>, and
was being more-catty-than-catwalk today.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Then why can&#146;t we talk to them?&#148; she suddenly demanded, but Alvaro
smiled at her in such a way that Manuel wondered if he&#146;d misread
Alvaro&#146;s
compass.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;What you&#146;re seeing is something that has already happened. The past.
All the people you see would be ghosts in our time because, sadly, with
the timescale involved, they&#146;d all be dead. We&#146;re not seeing dead
people, though. We&#146;re seeing images that have already happened. Done,
dusted, over. Hence we can&#146;t interact with them.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;But you said they could see us,&#148; Natalia insisted.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;As ghosts, right. We&#146;re like Scrooge&#146;s last visitor. The ghosts of
things to come. But because we can&#146;t change what&#146;s already happened, we
can&#146;t do anything but observe. We can&#146;t interact.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;What if I wrote down a message now, held it up, and then came back a
week later&#133; Surely the person would have seen the message and then they
would have time to respond to it.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;No.&#148; Alvaro laughed and Manuel resented both the amount of time
Natalia was monopolising the guide and the fact that her tail was up and
she was in for a stubborn fight to prove she was right, ruining his own
chances with the guide when they got back to their own time.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Why not?&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Because we&#146;re not able to change what happens, merely observe
it.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;But they are.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Unfortunately not. Although they see us, they can&#146;t respond--because
they didn&#146;t the first time around&#133;when we weren&#146;t there.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;But that would mean&#133;&#148; Natalia was scratching her head, oblivious of
all the other members of the tour group who just wanted to see the 2010
World Cup they&#146;d come to visit, when Spain would win its first final.
&#147;Well, that it&#146;s actually the <i>future</i> that can&#146;t be changed. I
mean, they can&#146;t change what they&#146;re going to do even though we show
them means that it&#146;s not the<i> past</i> that&#146;s static&#151;it can&#146;t be,
because we&#146;re here, we&#146;re in it and you said we weren&#146;t before&#151;but the
<i>future</i>.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;That would also be the reason why we can return to the point in time
when we left, but not travel any further into the future.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>Natalia was furious about something as she glared at the guide.
Alvaro nodded for the rest of their party to go on ahead and join those
already filtering into Johannesburg&#146;s Soccer City stadium.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;You&#146;re telling me my future is set and there&#146;s nothing I can do
about changing it?&#148; Natalia asked him. &#147;That I can&#146;t even <i>see</i>
what&#146;s happening? Well, unless a future time traveller comes back and
holds up a sign or picture of how things turned out. And even then all I
can do is sit tight, teeth gritted, and let my future just happen?&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Nati,&#148; Manuel said, putting a hand on her wrist. It was cold, damp,
the muscle beneath tight as wet stone, and she yanked it away. &#147;You&#146;re
telling me I can&#146;t stop anything from happening that&#146;s already happened
to my future self?&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;That&#146;s kind of right,&#148; Alvaro said. &#147;Because future is a perception
and not a reality, your future is only future as far as you&#146;re
concerned. For those looking back, who lived after you, your future is
their past.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;And they&#146;ve already happened?&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Everything has already happened. Everything that will ever happen,
has happened. Put simply: we reached the end.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>Manuel felt a shiver run down his spine. &#147;You mean I&#146;m dead? We&#146;re
all dead?&#148; he asked.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;I mean that the moment time travel became possible was because time
itself became a meaningless concept. It was passive. Like a dead snake
that will no longer rear up and bite you if you poke it in different
places along its body. It finally allowed two contradicting concepts:
the past cannot be changed, and the theoretical possibility of time
travel. This is the only way both are compatible.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;When there is no future left to disrupt&#133;&#148; Natalia said.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;I&#146;m <i>dead?</i>&#148; Manuel repeated.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;We all die, Mani!&#148; Natalia snapped. &#147;Just get over it!&#148;</p>
	   
<p>It was his time to round on her, though. Best friend or not, there
was a cute guide to consider and, anyway, his emotions were as important
as hers.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;We-ell, sor-ry, Se&#241;orita Perfectita! I don&#146;t know who&#146;s chewed a
chunk out of your ass today, but you&#146;re being a total bitch.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;I saw a ghost before we left. Visiting me. My daughter.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Your <i>daughter?</i>&#148; Manuel asked, running round in front of her
and giving both her arms a squeeze. &#147;Well, get you, Mamita!&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;She showed me a message telling me I was going to die giving birth
to her.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Oh&#133;&#148; Manuel turned the arm squeeze into a hug, for the first time
forgetting about Alvaro, who watched them with sympathetic detachment.
As Natalia&#146;s shoulders hitched up and fell several times, Manuel pushed
her away and lined up his eyes with hers. &#147;Ignore the guide, he doesn&#146;t
know everything.&#148; </p>
	   
<p>But Natalia raked her sleeve over her nose. &#147;He will. He&#146;s the
father.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>The emotion that struck was inappropriate, selfish, outrageous--when
Manuel was able to calm himself after and think about how he&#146;d reacted.
But it came before he was able to stop it.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Say <i>what?</i>&#148; He looked between the two of them, Alvaro for the
first time losing his cool, pressing a finger to his chest and mouthing
<i>&#145;What, me?&#146;</i></p>
	   
<p>&#147;<i>One</i> of the fathers,&#148; Natalia said through her sniffles.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;How many do you <i>need</i>, girl?&#148; Manuel said, hand on hip, not
yet losing his indignation.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Not me, my daughter. She needed two. You and Alvaro. You adopt her.
Well, when I say &#145;adopt&#146;, Alvaro was the biological father. He donated,
not impregnated.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>Alvaro&#146;s eyes were bulging as he stared,
mouth hanging open.</p>
	   
<p>Manuel didn&#146;t know what to feel, nor precisely what he <i>was</i>
feeling.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;She was beautiful,&#148; Natalia said. &#147;I wish I could see more of
her&#133;&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Shush now, shush&#133;&#148; Manuel said.</p>
	   
<p>Alvaro cleared his throat. &#147;Er&#133;her father happens to work for the
leading Time-visits agency there is? So I predict she&#146;ll be flying back
every evening&#133;&#148;</p>
	   
<p>Manuel smiled over Natalia&#146;s shoulder at his future husband. &#147;Not
till the little squirt&#146;s done her homework,&#148; he said.</p>
	   
<p>Natalia nodded, sniffling, finally&#151;Manuel was pleased to see&#151;using a
handkerchief rather than her sleeve.</p>
	   
<p>&#147;You&#146;d better do a good job, dopes. Or I&#146;ll come back to haunt you.
Or forward. Or whatever it takes.&#148;</p>
	   
<p>&#147;Sure, Ghost-mama. Sure&#133;&#148; </p>
	   
<p>Arm in arm, the three walked towards the stadium where the vuvuzela
horns and screams of the crowd seemed to welcome their own moment of
triumphant resolution.</p>
