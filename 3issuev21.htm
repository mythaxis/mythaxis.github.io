<div><i>&#147;I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs; A palace and a 
prison on each hand.&#148; <br /><small>Lord Byron</small>.</i>
<p class=drop>The ancient city of Venice, as everybody
knows, is an island inside a lagoon at the northern end of the Adriatic.
The island is divided into two by the Grand Canal, which zigs, zags and
zigs from north to south in the shape of a lazy figure 2. The city
traditionally governed an area of north east Italy, and over many
centuries was a major naval, mercantile, financial and colonial power.
For most of its history, it was an independent state, and it
maintained this spirit of independence even while it was passed back and
forth between Italy and Austria for a while.
<P>
Italy fumbled the ball when their financial problems with the EU could
no longer be ignored, and Venetian public works were said to be
bankrupting the nation. So Italy tried to sell Venice to the highest
bidder. There were no takers, but the city staged a sort of management
buy-out, and now we have what we always wanted - actual independence,
like
Scotland and Catalonia. We have re-invented ourselves as a nation state,
a free port and a tax haven, much more profitable and respectable than
our previous occupation - tourist trap. The waterbuses, still known as
'vaporetti', no longer roar and fume as they did when I was a child. An
electric whine propels them smoothly along the canals.
<P>
This is not the Venice of the early twenty-first century, with three
million tourists a year. This is the Venice of the late
twenty-first century, more resembling the Venice of the nineteenth
century Grand Tour, where the majority of visitors were scholars,
artists and writers. Most of us who work in Venice also live here.
<P>
On a chilly, bright, November morning, I was walking towards my place of
work along the Fondamenta Cannaregio, alongside the canal on my left. I
remembered, when I was a child, seeing egrets spearing tiny fish where I
was now walking. Looking like tiny herons, egrets are naturally nervous
birds, but they took advantage of Venice's <I>acqua alta</I> in which
seasonal high tides caused the city to be regularly flooded. Sirens and
other alarms accompanied these floods. The high tides seldom invaded
homes to a very great extent. Nevertheless, many households opted to
abandon the ground floors of their dwellings, and moved upstairs on a
permanent basis. I reflected that <I>acqua alta</I> was a thing of the
past now, the Tidal Harness project having, at one stroke, solved both
the flooding problem and part of the city's need for electric power.
<P>
Or so I thought. Even as I checked my x-pda e-mail on the hoof, a
strange, low-pitched creaking noise from across the water attracted my
attention. The ominous groan was followed by the graceful collapse of a
building into the canal. This surprising event was accompanied by a
minor <i>tsunami</i>, and I was briefly standing up to the knees in what
was once egret territory. An electric water taxi was flung against a
moored delivery vessel and nearly overturned. This was, at one stroke,
irritating and interesting. Most of the water returned to the canal
quite rapidly, leaving only a few centimetres in nearby shops and in my
shoes. This latter inconvenience was forgotten in the shock at having
witnessed  some hundreds of tons of masonry arriving in a navigable
waterway. A queue of <i>vaporetti</i>, cargo barges, water taxis, and
siren-wielding police and fire launches accumulated around the blockage.
In due course, rumour reported that the building had been empty and that
no-one was injured or missing. I moved away from the scene when a
heavy-duty barge with a huge JCB backhoe on its foredeck was towed into
place and started to clear the channel. The barge was tilted acutely
forward due to the weight of the digger, and the whole vessel wobbled
alarmingly from side to side as the JCB transferred masonry to the
barge's open hold, but Venetian engineers have always regarded this kind
of waterborne operation as business as usual.
<P>
Having fortified myself with a <I>caff&#232; corretto</I> in a local caf&#233;, I
texted my deputy Tomas that I was returning home to change my
trousers, socks and shoes. When I left home again, it was nearly
lunchtime. Lunch beckoned, I answered the call. I deserved a good lunch.
<P>
That was why it was mid-afternoon by the time I walked past the scene of
the accident again. The quayside was swarming with spectators and
officials. I was told that it had been the old Finance Administration
office, empty and under renovation. Heads were going to roll, I heard.
Bribery and corruption of high officials was suspected. I discounted
most of this. Whilst high crimes and misdemeanours have always been a
feature of Venetian life, I find stupidity to be a more common cause of
disasters like this. Like many of the buildings in Venice, the Finance
Administration office had started life as a church. By the time Venice
became independent thirty years ago, many churches had been repurposed
as theatres, art galleries, museums, even supermarkets, but church
architecture rendered them rather unsatisfactory as offices.
<P>
Meanwhile, the canal was navigable in single file. A couple of policemen
were attempting to organise traffic flow with the aid of flags and
megaphones, but since ACTV waterbuses are now driverless, the change in
canal geography confused their software, while flags were perceived as
moving obstructions, and the waterbuses
plunged forwards and backwards
without making any progress. Similarly, a convoy of driverless barges
was complicating the issue behind the jam. <P>Venetian boatmen are a law unto
themselves, however, and the
frantic signals were largely ignored by any boat with a driver,
priority of passage through the
narrow channel being determined by size or manouevreability	of vessel
and by how loud and threatening were their airhorns or the shouts of
their drivers.
<P>
My cell rang. It was Tomas. "Where are you, boss? You were going to get
here before lunch."
<P>
"Nearly there. What's the problem?"
<P>
"Palumbo is looking for you. I told him you'd had an accident and you'd
be in soon."
<P>
I wasn't used to being pressurised in this job. Chief Security Officer
for a multinational company headquarters sounded impressive enough, but,
in practice, it hadn't been particularly onerous. I was a fugitive from
the Carabinieri - Italy's military police. Not in the sense of being
pursued by them, but as an ex-employee who had succeeded in getting a
nice job in civic society.  Checking personnel for identity and criminal
history?  My previous career helped there. Making sure access to the
building was electronically controlled and wiring the building up with
surveillance cameras and a control room? The contract awarded to a local
firm. Did I accept a modest reward for choosing a particular security
company? Of course I did. Suspicions would have arisen if I hadn't.
<P>
The office. A venerable palazzo with an abandoned, slightly sunken, 
ground floor and a well-worn, marble, dramatic, staircase to the inhabited 
upper levels. Ancient floor tiles, stone window frames, marble and granite 
pediments, ceiling art, the whole Venetian
experience. The building is entered, however, through a mean little door in a gloomy
alleyway. The other side of the building faces - looms over - the canal. That side has a 
magnificent reconditioned water entrance, accessible only by boat, and used 
for the delivery of large items and the 
reception of VIPs.  
<P>
I made my way to the boss's opulent domain. The boss. One hundred and ten 
kilos of flesh, wrapped in an Armani suit.
A bullet head with tiny eyes and rubbery lips. To be deferred to and
addressed as Dottor Palumbo.
<P>
In addition to the boss, there were two other men in the boss's office
when I arrived. Vincenzo Grasso, the IT chief - skinny, sporting a beard
that would disgrace a nanny goat, no dress sense. And Luigi Lombardo,
the consultant architect, who advised on structural matters and building
regulation - smooth and elegant, clean hands. All eyes were on me.
<P>
Palumbo said: "Ah, Fabbri, at last. I hope we have not wrenched
you from the arms of your lover this afternoon."
<P>
I tried not to show any surprise that Palumbo knew about my occasional
lunchtime assignations and replied "Dottore, I was almost drowned this
morning. It is a miracle that I stand before you now."
<P>
"Don't lay it on too thick, Fabbri. I understand you witnessed a
building collapse this morning, and got your feet wet."
<P>
"Certainly, Dottore."
<P>
"How did it happen?"
<P>
"It seemed quite spontaneous."
<P>
"Spontaneous? What does that mean?
<P>
"As far as I can gather, the place just fell in the canal. It was closed
and unoccupied at the time. There
was no explosion. No warning. I was there."
<P>
"And why were you there?"
<P>
"Pure chance, Dottore. I had just got off the <I>vaporetto</I> at the
Guglie waterbus stop. I was on my way here. It was very shocking."
<P>
"Yes, well, Fabbri. We've all had a look. It's only a few hundred metres
away. Meanwhile, we have a serious situation here," said Palumbo, "There
have been threats."
<P>
"Threats?" I was floundering, trying not to show it.
<P>
Grasso broke in, his silly beard wagging: "Emails threatening
the stability of this building and promising a demonstration."
<P>
Lombardo said: "What he means is a demonstration such as you witnessed
this morning." This earned him a glare from Grasso.
<P>
I said: "Someone threatening to demolish this building? How many
emails?"
<P>
"A dozen or more over three months," said Palumbo.
<P>
"A dozen! I'm the security chief here. Why wasn't I told?"
<P>
"They were addressed to me. We didn't believe it," said Palumbo, "Not
until today."
<P>
Lombardo said: "It was news to me too, until today. I am only here
because I'm the architectural consultant. I understand building
stability."
<P>
"My decision," said Palumbo, "I was acutely aware that this kind of
thing could cause panic, and the fewer people knew about what was
probably a hoax, the better. Anyway, we have to take this seriously now.
Fabbri, you're in charge."
<P>
"Me?" I said.
<P>
"You, naturally. The security chief. I know that you do your work to
your own satisfaction, but it happens that you also do it to <i>my</i>
satisfaction. Take the lead for the three of you. Please do not involve
anyone else."
<P>
I said: "Are they asking for money?"
<P>
"<I>Of course</I> they are asking for money. It's extortion. We have
plenty of money, they want some, and we may end up having to pay, but I
am
relying on you three to make it unecessary. They've been sensible. It's
not a huge amount of money by the company's standards. About one day's
profit. But I can't pay it out just for the asking. Either bring these
guys to justice or at least determine that the threat is real and that
paying them will remove the threat, so I can justify the expenditure.
Now get on with it. Go!"
<P>
"Are you saying we should not involve the police?" I asked.
<P>
Palumbo's eyes bulged with fury: "Of course not! We don't want this all
over the newspapers! We can't afford any publicity."
<P>
"Got it, Dottore. Just wanted to check."
<p class=drop>I mentioned earlier that the company we worked for was a
multinational. Let me explain the title. It isn't just that the company
has a presence in many countries, trading in each country as a locally
incorporated subsidiary company. A multinational company also tends to
have a head office in a tax haven like Venice, Singapore or Grand
Cayman.
<P>
Now, each of the subsidiary companies decides how much tax they want to
pay to their host government, or, rather, how little and how late they
can get away with paying, bearing in mind that this is partly a
political calculation. How much does the host country value the
employment the company offers to its citizens (who then pay income tax),
or the support the company offers to sports events or charities (which
they, the government, are not keen to fund)? Then, no matter how much
gross profit the subsidiary actually makes, head office bills the
subsidiary for 'accountancy' services to reduce the net profit to the
desired level. Or, if this begins to look excessive, charges
outrageously high interest on 'loans' supposedly given to the
subsidiary.
<P>
So, the vast majority of the profit earned by the company as a whole
finishes up in the head office, and tax is paid at the local very small
tax rate. The vast sum of money is then lodged with an international
bank in, say, Switzerland, and subsequently used to buy up smaller rival
companies and to enrich the investors. Therefore, most of the head
office employees are high-powered accountants, international lawyers and
IT staff.
<P>
And don't think I disapproved of the company, which, to protect their
identity, I shall call "<b>Musestre</b>". They paid me generously for my
efforts, but it had begun to look as if I was about to earn my salary.
	
<p class=drop>In the boss's office, I had tried to look as if I
understood what was going on, but I didn't fully comprehend the threat
until we three gathered in Grasso's office to review some of the emails.
They were all a little different, but the message was always clear.
<P>
Until today, the messages had taken the form:
	
<blockquote><tt>From: avenger@collapso.org<br>
To: info@musestrehq.it<br>
Subject: Collapse of Musestre<br>
------------------------<br>
Your building is in danger. We are in a position to make it collapse
into the water. We will demonstrate our capability on an unoccupied
building. Once that happens, and you will recognise it, you must
indicate your willingness to pay one million euros by placing the word
'si' in the bottom left corner of the contact page of your website
musestrehq.vc. We will then email instructions for your payment and, if
we receive the money within two hours of these instructions, we will
withdraw the threat. If you do not indicate your willingness to pay
within seven days of our demonstration, then you lose the opportunity to
buy your way out, and your building will fall apart. A four hour warning
will be given.<br>
Avenger.</tt>
</blockquote>
	
Today's message was :
	
<blockquote><tt>From: avenger@collapso.org<br>
To: info@musestrehq.it<br>
Subject: Collapse of Musestre<br>
------------------------<br>
The clock is ticking. You have five days to indicate 'si' in your
contact page.<br>
Avenger.</tt>
</blockquote>
	
I said: "I see. Silly question... Have you traced avenger@collapso.org?"
<P>
Grasso sneered. "A silly question indeed. Naturally the server
collapso.org does not exist. I have not been
able to identify the sender, and none of our clever technicians can
suggest anything. Analysing the internet route backwards leads us into a
maze of redirects
which are intrinsically and
deliberately untraceable. Such VPNs, as they are called, are designed to
foil even governmental oversight. We use them ourselves for privacy
purposes. The originator could be anywhere from Mongolia to next door."
<P>
"Why do you think they are giving us so little time after giving us the
instructions for payment?"
<P>
"It's obvious. I imagine they are making sure we cannot plan to identify
them in the handover."
<P>
"Of course. Sorry. In that case, what if we don't pay, take the risk,
and just evacuate the building? We rent it. The problem devolves upon
the landlord."
<P>
A pained grin from Grasso. "I regret to inform you that the property
owner is a subsidiary of Musestre, insured by yet another subsidiary."
<P>
"What's the purpose of that?"
<P>
Another patronising smile from Grasso: "Accountancy. Tax dodge.
Legalised money laundering."
<P>
I turned to Lombardo and asked "As a consultant architect, I should ask
if it's even possible deliberately to bring a building to a state of
collapse like that?"
<P>
"Normally, no. Even though Venice is a special case. Believe it or not,
the entire city is supported on wooden piles driven through mud into the
clay below."
<P>
"Yes, I know, and I know that we are all sinking at half a millimetre or
so per year. But I hear that the wooden piles are effectively petrified,
as, in the absence of oxygen within the mud, they cannot rot."
<P>
"This is true, building collapses are almost unknown in Venice, unless
you count the campanile in 1902, which is why we initially discounted
the threat. But this event today... I must investigate. I have contacts
within the firm which was renovating the place."
<P>
"So, here we are. We have seven days to solve or surrender. Grasso, I
think you must prepare to put the signal on the contact page, but not
yet. Chat with the IT managers of other firms in Venice. Make no
reference to our problem, but one of your colleagues may let something
slip. Perhaps other companies may be under threat."
<P>
"That's not a new idea, Fabbri. I've been asking some discreet
questions. No response."
<P>
"Anything you need to do for your computers in the event of a collapse?"
<P>
"That's unthinkable. All the data about this company and all our branch
offices is contained in the computers on site here. You cannot
overestimate how vital and complex that data is."
<P>
"I think I can, Grasso. But isn't it backed up?"
<P>
"It's backed up, but only here. We could not afford to allow exterior
access to our data. The data centres - the original and the live backup
- have no connection to the outside world, so they cannot be hacked. The
problem with that is that although our eggs are in two baskets, both
baskets are in this building. We could not survive a building collapse
like the Finance Administration place this morning."
<P>
I turned to Lombardo. "And you will investigate the collapse today?
Could it have been accidental? I think you said you have contacts."
<P>
"Of course."
<P>
I suggested that we should meet here daily at ten in the morning. They
agreed.
<P>
Grasso set me up with an anonymised e-paq, which he remarked was
untraceable in much the same way as the system the blackmailers were
using. Then I spent the rest of the day on the internet, looking for
analogous cases. Extortion under threat of demolition turned out be
unknown, no matter how I posed the question. Grasso seemed gratified by
my failure, confiding that he had, in fact, already conducted a similar
search.
	
<p class=drop>In fact, to my surprise, Lombardo was as good as his word.
The next morning he appeared at our meeting with an ancient, blackened
piece of timber. It was a section about fifteen centimetres in length,
apparently sawn off a building support pile, roughly circular in
cross-section, one end splintered off. On close inspection, the whole
section, in particular the splintered end, was weakened by a mass of
microscopic holes, as if bored by tiny woodworms.
<P>
"So what am I looking at? Accidental or deliberate?" I asked.
<P>
"How could one tell?" said Grasso, "It could be anything."
<P>
Lombardo said: "It is very unusual. I do not know of any natural cause.
I have never seen damage like this. The Venice Conservation department,
which checks out all sorts of rot, pests, canal water or acid rain
damage are examining a sample like this. I have a contact in the
laboratory, so I should know this afternoon."
<P>
"Well done, Lombardo, keep up the good work." He glared. It seemed he
suspected me of patronising him. Grasso sniggered.
<P>
Nevertheless, Lombardo telephoned some hours later and arranged to meet
with me in a noisy bar near the office. In a hushed tone, barely audible
over the general row, he told me: "The news from the Conservation
Department is alarming."
<P>
"How so?"
<P>
"It appears that the damage to the collapsed building's piles may be the
work of nanorobots."
<P>
Having nothing to contribute, I just stared at him.
<P>
He continued: "Nanorobots are tiny microscopic machines that reproduce
each other and can be put to certain tasks."
<P>
"I know what nanorobots are, Lombardo. What do you think they use in the
manufacture of quantum computers, the conversion of sewage, the
purification of water, the removal of particulates and heavy metals from
our air-con units? Are you telling me our nanorobots have gone mad and
are eating the foundations of buildings?"
<P>
"No. They appear to be a specialist type that have been introduced."
<P>
"And are they now spreading to every building in the city?"
<P>
"Apparently not. They have a short life. I understand Venice
Conservation are pursuing this, based on the examples the laboratory
has. But not within the timescale we are working to."
<P>
"So we're screwed."
<P>
"It seems so. Has Grasso made any progress with the emails?"
<P>
"Not as far as I know," I said.
<P>
"I didn't think he would. I don't like the little turd."
<P>
"He's all we've got on the IT front."
<P>
I checked with Grasso before leaving work. He and a couple of his
techies were wading through a terabyte of internet logs, looking for a
clue to the identity of the blackmailers. He did not look hopeful. He
showed no interest in the news from Lombardo.
	
<p class=drop>Day 2: The ten o'clock meeting was cancelled. Lombardo
couldn't make it. Grasso said he wasn't surprised the pompous ass had
nothing new. He named a few other IT managers who might have been
threatened. He was going to have a friendly chat with them, and see if
anything came up in conversation.
<P>
While I knew I couldn't talk to outsiders about the extortion, the
collapse of the Financial Administration building was the talk of the
city. Most of the flippant conversations centred around the symbolic
significance of Financial Administration being all at sea, a total
washout, unstable, or requiring a thorough clean out.
<P>
I was feeling some frustration, and needed to talk to a scientist in
general terms. I knew where my American friend and general manager of
the Tidal Harness, Tommy Hay (TH of the TH as he styled himself), would
be at lunch-time that day. The golf club. An unexpected, century-old,
gem of a course, set in woods at the far end of the Lido. It features
the only hill I've ever seen in Venice, about fifteen metres in height.
<P>
I took a water taxi all the way to the little marina outside the club.
<P>
Tommy was, as predicted, relaxing with a beer in the clubhouse. After a
few pleasantries about the weather (excellent) and his golf
(disappointing), he felt the need to boast about the Tidal Harness.
<P>
"Forget solar energy! A few one-metre tides generated enough lunar
energy to operate the barrier to prevent the lagoon flooding due to the
same tides. I wonder we aren't slowing the moon down, all the energy
we're sucking out of it!"
<P>
That said, he appeared to realise that I had questions on my mind, and
raised an eyebrow.
<P>
"The collapse of the Financial Authority building..." I began.
<P>
"Hah! Yes! Very strange and unexpected, of course. Not that the fellows
at the Financial Administration are terribly upset. They hated that
office! Still, it's a puzzle. Since the Tidal Harness was started up,
building erosion due to high tides is almost unknown."
<P>
"Quite. I've heard that the piles in the foundations may have been eaten
away by nanorobots."
<P>
"Preposterous! Where did that idea come up?"
<P>
"Just a rumour, but I've heard that there's some evidence."
<P>
"Well, a few years ago, there was talk of using stuff like that to
remove derelict piles that were clogging up a canal, but nothing came of
it. It was Venice Conservation's show, really. I was just involved on
behalf of the Harness project."
<P>
"So the technology exists?"
<P>
"Sure. Some Indonesian company developed the idea to deal with mangrove
roots in navigable waterways. Hell, that's not the sort of thing anyone
should let loose in Venice."
<P>
"I agree. But what if...? Can it be targeted, then stopped?"
<P>
"OK. Well, if I remember, international regulations limit the number of
generations the machines can reproduce, so that the nanorobots can't run
amok. To use them you'd have to continuously supply new starter
cultures. It was going to be awkward enough to use them in a dredging
operation. To use them inside the city would be lunacy."
<P>
The converation drifted away into discussion of the proposed, but
endlessly discussed, offshore windfarms and solar panels feeding a huge
storage battery on one of the islands, reducing Venice's need to buy
electricity from Italy. Every Venetian could hold forth for hours on the
subject.
	
<p class=drop>Back at the office, I went to the IT department to talk to
Grasso. He wasn't there, but I spoke to one of the techies who had been
helping him earlier. According to him, they had found no sign of the
origin of the threatening e-mails. "Strange," he said. "I'd expected to
recognise a source VPN. The most recent IP on the e-mails doesn't
exist." 
<P> 
There was an e-mail for me from Tommy Hay, however. It
read:
<blockquote><tt> Hi, I found contact information on that
nanorobot company. It's Malaysian, not Indonesian. Kuala Belait Trading
Company. The contact is Mahmud Rahman, really great guy, attach his
card. You're up to something.  Tell me about it some day.<br>
Tommy.</tt></blockquote>  <P><P> 
The time in Malaysia would be after office
hours. I'd call tomorrow. Besides, I had Commedia dell'Arte to go to.
And the Commedia turned out to be important in this story. 
<P> The
Venice Marionette Theatre was a brilliant new concept in the traditional
art of Commedia dell'Arte. It was a small theatre in a Palazzo that had
once been used for temporary exhibitions. The Isola di Pinocchio company
produced a different play every month, some from the 17th century canon,
others newly written in the traditional style, some modelled on modern
comedies. All were full of witty contemporary comment, and presented by
suitably beautiful string puppets, some of the villains caricaturing a
close resemblance to prominent Venetians. 
<P> The Commedia depends on a
limited number of stock characters in an infinite variety of
situations, and it was a monthly treat to be entertained. Seats were in
great demand; I wasn't prepared to miss tonight's performance. 
<P> As
usual, the plot hinged on conspiracies, accidents, disguise,
misunderstandings, love, greed, hatred, slapstick and sentimentality.
Just like life, in fact.
	
<p class=drop>Day 3: I called Mahmud Rahman, whose information confirmed
Tommy's memory of Kuala Belait Trading Company's contact with the Venice
Conservation department.
<P>
Then I made a Skype call to an old Carabinieri colleague in Rome, an
expert in IT fraud, asking him about tracing e-mails. He confirmed that
faking the apparent sender of an e-mail was simple, and while internet
service providers may disclose client information to governmental
authorities, they always take their time about it. The conclusion? You
cannot find the originator of an email in our timescale.
<P>
I went down to the busy accountancy section of Musestre, where dozens of
honest professionals worked the daily miracle of legally defrauding
foreign governments of their legitimate tax revenue. My enquiries led me
to Irina, who specialised in squirrelling away the money Musestre
accumulated.
<P>
"Can you spare the time to satisfy my curiosity, Irina. As Security, I
think it's important that I know these things."
<P>
"Whatever you like," said Irina, a very young woman to be in charge of
all these billions.
<P>
"I'd like to ask about something we read about in books, where criminals
transfer money to a bank account, and that money is immediately and
secretly whisked away into untraceable accounts elsewhere."
<P>
"And you suspect someone here?"
<P>
"Not at all. This is strictly for my own information. We security people
must be aware of these hazards."
<P>
"Hmm... I suddenly discover that I'm busy right now. Do you mind if we
discuss this over lunch?"
<P>
I was taken aback. "That's fine. Which restaurant do you prefer?"
<P>
"No. No. We'll go to the panini place in the square, and eat outside.
OK?"
<P>
"I know where you mean. Twelve?"
<P>
"Fine."
<P>
I was waiting outside the baguette and panini bar at five to twelve,
watching two kittens playing 'Tear Your Throat Out', between taking
catnaps curled up around each other. Irina arrived late. We ordered.
<P>
She said: "I wanted to discuss this with you privately because
this is not the first time someone has asked me about this. Someone
yesterday asked me to prepare for an urgent cash
transfer to an account, possibly foreign, with his authority, no
paperwork."
<P>
I said: "Our esteemed leader, Mario Palumbo."
<P>
"You know about this?"
<P>
"Yes. And, as far as the company is concerned, it will be a justified
expenditure."
<P>
"That's a relief. What's it all about?"
<P>
"I can't tell you that, but tell me about these untraceable accounts."
<P>
"It's not as easy as people think, and it's pretty expensive, and it
takes a while, but here's how it usually works. It's not really my
line. The people in the computer department are the best to ask."
<P>
"In summary?"
<P>
"Well, you contact one of a number of organisations who advertise on the
internet. For a fee, they set up a number, at least two, of shell
companies in countries with loose banking laws - like Venice is these
days. Each company has at least one offshore bank account."
<P>
"Shell company?"
<P>
"A company in name only. Doesn't really trade, just accepts and
disburses money, covering the transactions with fake invoices and
receipts. It has to be done in an administration where transfers of
greater than $10,000 do <i>not </i>have to be reported."
<P>
"I see."
<P>
"When the money arrives in the first account, the shell company
transfers it to another shell company, usually in another country, in
payment of a fake invoice, and so on, and when the money ends up in its
destination, the final company issues debit cards so that the owner of
the chain can spend the money."
<P>
"Simple."
<P>
"Not so very simple. It's expensive. Often the arranger takes an upfront
fee and as much as twenty percent of the money transferred, and it's
illegal, but seldom prosecuted or even detected. There are plenty of
apparently respectable people who live on these accounts."
<P>
"Thank you, Irina. What you are telling me is that it's entirely
possible and virtually undetectable."
<P>
"Quite so. Tell me, Fabbri, is this anything to do with the Financial
Authority building?"
<P>
"Why do you ask?"
<P>
"Well, I've seen a lot of that Luigi Lombardo this week, and he was in
charge of the FA building renovation."
<P>
"No, no. He was nothing to do with that. What made you think so?"
<P>
"I'm in constant touch with the FA over technical matters. It's an open
secret over there."
<P>
"Hmmm. I knew he had contacts with them. I hadn't realised he was so
deeply involved. It's really rather delicate. I'd rather you said
nothing to anyone else. Another coffee?"
<P>
"No thanks. I have some shopping to do. Thanks for lunch!"
<P>
I spent part of the afternoon in the Venice Conservation Department. I
was passed from official to official, but no-one would talk to me about
the FA building. I spent most of my wasted time in the planning
department.
<P>
Finally, since I was in the area, I visited an old friend, and fellow
ex-Carabinieri, Tito Boscone, one of the IT men Grasso had planned to
'chat' with. He hadn't seen Grasso for months. We were about to go out
for a drink when I got a call from Dottore Palumbo.
	
<p class=drop>Palumbo was waiting for me in my own office. It was after
hours. A bad sign.
<P>
"Progress?" he grunted. He looked pale and sweaty.
<P>
I gave him a summary of the situation. He indicated surprise about the
nanorobots. "So the threat could be real?"
<P>
"In theory, but even if the technology exists, it's a little
far-fetched," I said.
<P>
"Looking at it from my point of view, Fabbri, if we don't pay and it's a
hoax, we save a million euros, but if we don't pay and it's real, we
could lose millions more, not only in the fabric and contents of the
building, but in the loss of valuable data and market position. If we do
pay, whether it's real or a hoax, it costs us just one million."
<P>
"But, Dottore, the worst, though perhaps least likely, event is that we
pay and the threat is still carried out."
<P>
"Then we lose just one million more in a disaster of many millions." He
paused, then: "The deadline is tomorrow. I have decided to pay. Get
Grasso to post that 'si' on the contact page now."
<P>
"Dottore, it's getting late," I said. "Grasso's probably home by now.
Let's say we signal them now and they reply immediately, we may have
difficulty getting a transaction of that size through in two hours. If
they don't, we'll be hanging around all night."
	
<P>At first, he looked as if he might explode, but Musestre hadn't put a
fool in charge of their Venice HQ. "OK. Tell Grasso to get ready to send
the signal first thing. I want to see you, Grasso and Lombardo in my
office at eight tomorrow morning. That signal is to be on the website by
nine."
<P>
Grasso wasn't in the office. Lombardo  hadn't left his whereabouts. I
telephoned each of them on their cells to let them know about the early
meeting, and walked home through the dark alleys and bright piazzas..
	
<p class=drop>Day 4: All four of us were in Palumbo's office before
eight. I had arranged for Tomas, a formidable giant, to wait
outside.
<P>
Grasso said: "Dottore, I think we should post the signal now."
<P>
Palumbo raised a weary hand. "Let Fabbri have his say. We'll post the
signal at nine."
<P>
I said: "I went to the Commedia the other evening, and the play gave me
the solution to this problem."
<P>
"What's this?" interrupted Grasso.
<P>
"Let him talk," said Lombardo, "The sooner this is over, the sooner I
can get some other work done." This earned him a glare from Grasso.
<P>
"Carry on," said Palumbo.
<P>
"The characters were as follows: <ul>
<li>A rich old man;
<li>His beautiful daughter;
<li>A miserly man, suitor to the daughter;
<li>A poor but upright soldier, another suitor;
<li>The mischievous servant;
<li>The cheeky maid."</ul>
<P>
"Oh, come on..." groaned Grasso.
<P>
"Yes, get to the point," said Lombardo.
<P>
"The rich man favours the soldier to marry his daughter, and agrees to
subsidise him. The miser sees his opportunity of marriage into a wealthy
family slipping away, and conspires with the doctor to pretend that the
rich man is dying of a rare complaint. The miser disguises himself as a
doctor from China who has a cure for the complaint that will cost the
rich man half his fortune. The plot becomes more and more complex, but,
in the end, the servants expose the conspiracy. Curtain. Applause."
<P>
Palumbo was looking thoughtful. Grasso, for once, had nothing to say.
<P>
Lombardo said: "Well, if that's all you've got, I'll be getting along."
<P>
"That isn't all I've got, Lombardo. You have never revealed to us that
you were in charge of the Financial Authority building refit."
<P>
"Client secrecy. I haven't told anyone I'm consulting for you at
Musestre, either."
<P>
"You might have mentioned it when the whole lot collapsed."
<P>
"On the contrary, confidentiality was then all the more important."
<P>
"Because, in fact, you were being well-paid to make sure it fell down,
so that they could build a more suitable building in its place."
<P>
"Ridiculous!"
<P>
"The plans for the new Financial Authority building are already lodged
with the planning department, as I discovered yesterday."
<P>
"This is all surmise. You can't prove a thing. Do you think I introduced
those nanorobots?"
<P>
"No, I don't. There are no nanorobots. I think the damaged timbers you
showed us were actually samples sent to Venice Conservation a while ago
from Kuala Belait Trading."
<P>
"You think so?"
<P>
"Not that it matters. What I <I>am</I> sure of is that the timber you
showed us was perfectly dry. It didn't look as if it had spent a couple
of hundred years in Venetian mud. You didn't have to prove anything to
us; you just had to offer the seeds of doubt until the extortion paid
off."
<P>
Lombardo stood up. "I don't have to listen to this. I'm leaving."
<P>
Palumbo said: "Wait a minute."
<P>
I said: "Let him go. He's right. We can't pin anything on him. But I'd
cancel his contract as architectural consultant."
<P>
With a crooked grin, Lombardo strode from the office. At my signal,
Tomas relieved him of his security pass, and walked him towards the
exit.
<P>
Grasso blurted out: "What a snake! I never liked him."
<P>
"Yet you had dinner with him last night."
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"I telephoned each of you within a minute or so at eight last night. In
the background, I could hear you were each in a restaurant with an
orchestra. The orchestra was playing the same tune behind each call."
<P>
Palumbo said: "Are you accusing Grasso? I thought we'd identified the
culprit."
<P>
Grasso said: "Just because we ate in the same restaurant..."
<P>
I said: "Someone had to concoct these fake e-mails, and I think we'll
find that you have also organised an offshore account to receive the
ransom. I have to say that when you showed me those previous e-mails, I
noticed that you hadn't displayed the trace routing information. It may
not have been helpful, but it was unnatural not to show it if you were
trying to trace it. The fact that your fellow technician 'found that the
source IP address doesn't exist' seemed odd. I later found out that this
could not be the case even with a deliberately disguised e-mail. I
believe you faked the e-mails yourself, who better? And Irina in
Investment Services seems to think that the IT department has some
expertise in untraceable accounts."
<P>
"Prove it!"
<P>
"I don't have to. All Dottor Palumbo needed was a reasonable certainty
that the threat was a hoax, and I've done that."
<P>
"I deny involvement!" said Grasso. "And I resign. You cannot accuse me
like this."
<P>
"Good decision, Grasso. Tomas will ensure that you leave the premises
immediately."
<P>
When Grasso had gone, Palumbo asked: "Well, that solved the problem. No
need to pay. How did you figure all that out?"
<P>
"I was confused at first. But when I saw that comedy, I realised that it
needed two conspirators, and everything just fell into place."
	
<p class=drop>Personally, I conceded that my reasoning was a trifle
flimsy. I spent the next couple of months worrying that I'd fingered the
wrong men, and that the building was going to finish up in the canal.
All I can say now is: "Not yet!"
