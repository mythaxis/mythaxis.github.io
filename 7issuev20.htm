<div><i><b>"Life's tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too
late."</b> <br> Benjamin Franklin<P><P></i>
<p class=drop>I am eighty-one years old. But I am young
again. You may
remember reading about Ponce de Leon, a Spanish explorer who spent many
years futilely searching for the Fountain of Youth. </p>
							   
<p>As we age, especially men, we often make foolish efforts to hold back
time. If we cannot be young again, at least let us not get any older.
For many years, that was my quest. </p>
							   
<p>I tried everything. I dyed my hair, worked out every day at the gym,
and drove flashy sports cars. But when I looked at young women, they
looked right through me. Or else, they treated me like the sad and
somewhat delusional old man that I was.</p>
							   
<p>My children worried about me. They threatened to take away my car
keys and began talking about wonderful apartments for seniors. </p>
							   
<p>To them, I had become a cantankerous old man. Loud music &#150; and
really, almost <i>any </i>music, bothered me. Twenty- and
thirty-year-olds with tattoos and body piercings drove up my blood
pressure. Sometimes just going out for a walk would subject me to
intolerable levels of noise and sight pollution.</p>
							   
<p>And then, one evening, as I passed a bar just off Bell Boulevard, I
peered inside. It looked like any other hangout, and yet there was
something very different about the atmosphere. I felt myself drawn
inside. </p>				   
							   
<p>Never much of a drinker, I walked up to the bar and asked for a
screwdriver. When the bartender put the drink down in front of me, she
did not look right though me. </p>
							   
<p>We made some small talk, and then she rushed off to serve another
customer. I smiled at myself, realizing that she was nice to <i>all</i>
her customers. It was just part of her job.</p>
							   
<p>Still, the place seemed pleasant, especially for a bar. There was
music, but it wasn&#146;t very loud. Most of the customers were quite young,
but there was also a sprinkling of older people &#150; some of whom seemed
about my own age. As I sipped my drink, I began to relax.</p>
							   
<p>But I couldn&#146;t help wondering what was going on. Was this &#147;bring your
grandma and grandpa to a bar night&#148;?</p>
							   
<p>Then I began to stroll around, occasionally making eye contact. A
young man smiled at me. I smiled back. I saluted with my glass and he
did the same. The young woman with him asked me to join them. </p>
							   
<p>I walked over and introduced myself. There were three or four other
people, all of them Millennials, and we all got into a friendly
political discussion. When the waitress came by, I ordered a round of
drinks. </p>				   
							   
<p>What may have bound us all together was the happy talk about the
president&#146;s impeachment. A couple of them admitted to being Republicans,
but the word we all used to describe the man was <i>schmuck</i>. </p>
							   
<p>When it was time for me to leave, a couple offered to drive me home.
Although it was just a few blocks, I happily accepted. I was feeling
pretty high. </p>			    <P><p class=drop>When I got up the next morning, I found myself in a great
mood. I remembered my dream &#150; the best I one I had had in years. I got
dressed and went for a long walk. The things that usually bothered me &#150;
the impatient drivers honking their horns, the morons with their blaring
car speakers, and landscapers operating their outrageously loud lawn
mowers &#150; none of them seemed to bother me half as much as they usually
did. </p>	 
			 
<p>By evening, I found that I was still in good mood. After dinner, I
went out for a stroll. And then, right in front of me was the same bar &#150;
the bar I had dreamed about. I had not noticed the sign before &#150; &#147;The
Fountain of Youth.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>Was I dreaming now? I pinched myself. Someone walking by called out
to me, &#147;Hey mister, do you think you&#146;re dreaming?&#148;</p>
			 
<p>I looked at the young man and asked, &#147;<i>Am</i> I?&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;Well, if <i>you </i>are, what does that make <i>me</i>?&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;That&#146;s a good question. Let me buy you a drink.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;OK, but just one. The wife&#146;s at home waiting for me.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>We went inside, and the bartender smiled at me.</p>
			 
<p>&#147;Welcome back.&#148; Then she looked at my new friend. </p>
			 
<p>&#147;What are you drinking?&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;Scotch and soda.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>A minute later, she placed our drinks on the bar.</p>
			 
<p>&#147;You must be a regular here.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;No, but I must have been here last night.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;You don&#146;t remember?&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;Actually, that&#146;s why I was pinching myself.&#148;</p>
			 
<p>&#147;Well, the barmaid knew what you like to drink. So, either you
<i>were </i>here last night, or she&#146;s a mind-reader. </p>
			 
<p>After we finished our drinks, I decided to call it an evening and
headed back home. </p>
			 
<p class=drop>The next morning, I knew for sure that something had
definitely changed in my
life. I talked on the phone with my kids, and not once did the words,
&#147;senior apartments&#148; come up. That evening I would go back to the bar.
Whatever was going on there, I wanted to have more of it. </p> <P><p>I remembered that Ponce De Leon wanted to drink water from the magic
fountain. Maybe he should have been looking for a different kind of
fountain &#150; a fountain from which he could drink vodka.</p>
	  
<p>That evening, my drink was waiting on the bar. Not too many people
are drinking anything orange these days. I thanked the barista and she
lingered for a while. She was an engineering student at Cooper Union,
which greatly impressed me. I confessed to being a recovering English
professor. </p>
	  
<p>Then she said something that really surprised me. &#147;You see that group
at the table near the window?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Yeah.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;They&#146;d like you to join them.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;How do you know?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;They gave me the high sign.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>So I picked up my drink and walked over to them. </p>
	  
<p>&#147;You must be thinking I&#146;m someone else. So no, even though we look
like twins, I&#146;m not Ashton Kutcher.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;You&#146;re <i>not</i>?&#148; said a very attractive young woman. &#147;You mean
all this time I&#146;ve had a crush on you, and you&#146;re the wrong guy?&#148;</p>
	  
<p>&#147;No ma&#146;am, <i>I&#146;m</i> not the wrong guy&#133;. <i>He </i>is.&#148;</p>
	  
<p>We introduced ourselves. It amazed me that I was easily old enough to
be their grandfather. But it didn&#146;t seem to matter. I hung with them for
over an hour and then headed home. </p>
	  
<p class=drop>Every evening after that I went to drink at &#148;The Fountain
of Youth.&#148; Sometimes I hung out at the bar, usually talking to other
patrons, and other times I joined couples or groups of people at the
tables. I looked around and noticed that there were people as old as I
sitting with groups of mostly younger people &#150; all engaged in animated
conversation. </p>
					 
<p>I was aware that the nation&#146;s somber mood had lifted considerably
since the schmuck had been impeached. But it had to be a lot more than
just that. Had attitudes towards the elderly changed all that much? Was
eighty the new thirty? </p>
					 
<p>Had we evolved from the &#147;Don&#146;t trust anyone over thirty&#148; mantra of my
youth to the &#147;Don&#146;t trust anyone under eighty&#148; of my dotage? Did the
young suddenly have a massive attitude adjustment, and begin to
appreciate the wisdom of the aged? </p>
					 
<p>Perhaps it was the other way around. Did we old fogeys get past our
feelings of uptightness and disapproval of the ways of the Millennials,
Gen X-ers and Gen Y-ers? Or had we suddenly worked out some kind of
grand compromise?</p>
					 
<p>I would never know the answer, nor would any of my contemporaries who
drank at &#147;The Fountain of Youth&#148;. Sometimes it's best to not ask too
many
questions.</p> <P><small>&copy; Steve Slavin 2017 All Rights Reserved </small>
