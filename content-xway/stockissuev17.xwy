[*BLURB] Welcome to the 17th issue of Mythaxis.
 
[*DESCRIPTION] <p class =drop>I present to you Mythaxis'
17th collection of short speculative fiction, the February 2016 edition.

In addition to a splendid crop of new stories, we have attempted two
experiments this time - a Comic Strip and an Interactive Story.

The Comic Strip, by Liam Baldwin, is one of a series of <b>Jet Starr and
her Astro Amazons</b> comics that he is working on.

Many
readers will be
familiar with the principle of the Text Adventure. If not, have a look
at <a href="http://www.amazonsystems.co.uk/data/textadv.htm"
target=blank>this page</a>.

Interactive adventures like Iceweb have a plot or variety of plots, but
it's up to the player to explore the plots themselves. The descriptions
offered by the game should be read carefully to reveal clues to the next
decision.

Unlike many text adventures, I have pitched this game at a fairly simple
level. The intention is to entertain, rather than to puzzle, and the
whole narrative is intended to be read, rather than solved as such.

<p class=drop>Now let me entertain you with a true tale of institutional
bureaucracy. I say 'true', and I mean it, but certain names and
identifying details have been altered to protect the guilty.

I was running a small sector in a large computer manufacturer's software
division. The sector was called, shall we say, Unusual Software. Which
meant that we dealt with anything that the rest of the product
development group wouldn't handle. For example, we wrote 'glue' software
to allow products written for one operating system to work on another,
and we owned a database product which was a rival to the company's main
database product. Politics.

One day a request arrived from the company's French division to alter an
accounting program they had bought from an external supplier. In order
to do this, we needed a particular computer type not available in the
UK. Let's call it a TSM1.

Me to France: Then send us a TSM1, please.

France to me: Well, certainly, but we believe it should be easier for
you to get one in the UK. There are several of an old model TSM0 that we
don't sell any more in a warehouse the UK division maintains at Heathrow
airport. Though the model is old, it is compatible.

Me to Warehouse: Please send me a TSM0. Charge it to France.

Warehouse to me: Sorry. We are not authorised to release one, unless we
receive a pro-forma payment in the form of a Capital Transfer Form from
a UK division.

Me to Warehouse: How much do these TSM0s cost?

Warehouse to me: Since they are superseded, they are valued at zero. We
just need the form... for form's sake.

Me to my local accountant: Please raise a Capital Transfer Form for a
TSM0 from Heathrow. Value zero.

Accountant to me: Done.  I've sent it to the Divisional Director for
signature.

Divisional Director to me: How dare you waste the company's time and
mine submitting a Capital Transfer Form for zero!

Me to Divisional Director: But.. but.. I am informed that this is the
procedure.

Divisional Director to me: Atrocious! I'll sort this out and get you
that TSM0.

Several weeks pass.	I don't like to press him, but when I do, I receive
a Capital Transfer Form for zero, signed by the Divisional Director, who
seems to have failed to clear the roadblock after all.

Me to Warehouse: I have here a Capital Transfer Form for a TSM0, signed
by our Divisional Director.

Warehouse to me: Sorry, mate, the TSM0s were recycled last week. On the
orders of your Divisional Director, apparently.

Gulp...

Me to France: Sorry. The TSM0s that were in the warehouse no longer
exist. Please arrange to send me a TSM0 or TSM1.

France to Me: By great good fortune, there is a spare TSM1 at an
exhibition in Czechoslovakia right now. When the exhibition is over, we
will ship it to you direct, instead of to Paris. No need for paperwork.

Several weeks pass.

Me to France: Umm... Where is that TSM1?

France to me: Hasn't it arrived? All the rest of the equipment from the
exhibition arrived back here. We shall ascertain the reason.

Me to France: I await your response.

France to me: Regrettably, that TSM1 was sold to a customer off the
exhibition stand in Brno, and is no longer available. Also, we find that
we no longer require the software alterations, as we no longer supply
the TSM range of computers.

Me to France: Why not?

France to me: It appears that we were losing some 10000 pounds every
time we sell one, due to a Sales-initiated pricing policy originating in
our German division.

Me to me: Grrrr...

Now you know one of the many reasons why, at risk to our livelihood and
pensions, my wife and I bade goodbye to big business and started a
small, and initially loss-making, software consultancy business.

[*AUTHOR] Christian Miller

[*BLURB]  "Hey, I'm a girl, and we like to play dress-up."
<small><b>Charlize Theron</b></small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Gem Roguestar kicked the door out of her
sort-of-Youtube-boyfriend's Volvo Valkyr.  The cockpit glass shouted at her in
impact font that 'excessive self-inflicted damage may void the warranty', and
to please stop.

"Patronizing aircars!"  Gem
stepped out, kicked the door again in a rage.  She checked the tip of her
stompy silver Powergirl boots for scuffing, checked her makeup in the mirrored
surface of the car's polarized exterior before it flew away.  <i>No
scuffing,
phew.</i>

The crowd was thick as cheap foundation
in front of The Fulcrum's immense glass towers, coagulating with cosplay,
crossplay, and mashplayers of every star-level and like!-tally.  

A genderbent Thor and Loki couple
swaggered by, the female Thor looking utterly Aryan.  6'2", perfectly
sculpted Miss Universe biceps, disproportionate boobs, tiara that was almost
certainly real platinum.  Probably a GMO-body grown just for this event.  You
had to be royalty to afford that kind of costuming swag.  Gem was the opposite
of that.  A cospauper.

"Hey, aren't you... what's her
name?" Lady Thor rubbernecked.

"Gem Roguestar?  Yes."  Gem
got up off the ground, did a pose.

"Uhhh... who?  No, you're a bit...
Nevermind.  Good luck in the competition!"  The two mythological and
literal goddesses walked off arm-in-gauntlet, laughing to themselves about
something, looking over their shoulder.  

<i>A bit... what?</i>  Gem's throat tightened,
like the time she'd accidentally eaten a peanut.  She'd worked on a small party
balloon of self-confidence, making costuming videos and fishing for compliments
on the Interwebz all day, and with that little bitchslap of negative human
interaction, she felt the balloon deflate.

<i>You're a microcelebrity, Gem.  No,
you're at least a millicelebrity, just look at your subscriber base!</i>
She
psyched herself up.  With a wave of her Power Glove throwing neon-emerald and
ruby holograms against the bright latticed vastness of High City.  A virtual
coliseum of her Followers erupted around her; mostly avatars of douche-looking
guys with names like "Cheetron" and "Warzennegar" with
endless drooly comments on her Ivy Valentine cosplay saying things like,
'gawwwwd, marry me baby or I'll seppuku myself', and 'Def SMASH!!!   I need
moar of DAT a$$!!!!'.  Gem felt that rush of pride and validation, like the
first time she beat Super Mario, and the confidence-balloon swelled, from the
size of an eyeliner brush up to a bronzer.

She scrolled down with her Power Glove's
directional pad and found a comment with twenty thumbs down.  She yelled at
herself not to read it, but then gave in, "IDK what you BBW-lovers are on
about.  This bitch is too much cottage cheese, and I'm not looking to save the
whales.  Kind of looks like a shemale too.  Stop embarrassing yourself, fatty."

<i>DELETE!!!</i>

But the damage had already been done,
the balloon exploded, and she took an aerosolized anti-anxiety spray up her
nostril in a futile attempt to combat a downward spiraling rash of negative
thought.  

<i>FUCK!  No crying, Gem!  Stupid, stupid!</i>
She picked herself up off the floor, retouched the delta of smeared mascara
from all her loser crying, and took a walk of shame to the end of the
registration line.  A long, thousand-person-long, line.

"Hey bootycakes, hows the con
going?" It was her sort-of-boyfriend, Lazerfalcon, on the holo-phone.

"Oh, uh, you know.  Going.  It's
great!"  She masked the hurt in her voice by calling up her
Japanese-schoolgirlish 'customer service' voice she used when working for call
centers, before robots ate up that job category globally.  

"That's great baby.  Hey- I just
wanted to check up to see if we're still on for that sub-orbital zero-g
after-after-party tonight.  I totes can't miss this.  Biz, you know? 
Connections to keep up and all, and I'm pretty sure D-Vuh will be there." 
D-Vuh, as in only the biggest 'webz star in the universe with 20 billion views
and 500 million subscribers.

"Oh, yeah!  Of course!" 

'<i>Don't get your hopes up, Gem,</i>' the
little devil on her right shoulder told her.  '<i>Your
sort-of-Youtube-boyfriend
always has an excuse for why he forgot to pick you up.</i>'

"Next!"  A seven foot
Juggernaut, complete with helmet head was at the ticketing booth.  His hands
were the size of wedding cakes.  Ok, not really the size of wedding cakes, more
like a nutella-snickerdoodle party cake.  God, relived-childhood-trauma crying
gave Gem such a craving for cake.  A cake crush.  A cake-on.  Yeah.

Gem got on her Power Glove and Twumbled
it to her meager hundred followers.

<tt>@GemRoguestar: "Relived-childhood-trauma
crying gives me SUCH a cake-on. #cakenomnom"</tt>

"Ma'am!  The walk-in registration
for the three-day event is two hundred sixty five dollars."  The giant
live-action comic book character boomed.

"What!  Oh sorry," Gem snapped
her fingers, dimming the me-dia hologram.  Pulled up her bank account balance. 
$214.  <i>Fuck</i>.

"I think I read on the I-con page
that celebrities get a discount, right?  I'm Gem Roguestar, I should be on the
list,"  She put one hand on her hip and crossed her knees in her best pinup
pose.

The Juggernaut pulled down ridiculously
tiny glasses to read something, "No, sorry, you're not on any of our
lists."

Gem felt a rush of desperation. 
Desperate times, desperate measures...  She touched the juggernaut's hand,
making hers look like a first-trimester fetus' in comparison, and gave her most
convincing sexy-eye.

"What are you doing?" The
juggernaut asked, yanking his hand back and looking around for managerial
staff.

"Oh, uh, nevermind.  How much is
just the one-day thing?"  

"One hundred dollars."

Gem sighed, held out her Power Glove to
be swiped by the Juggernaut's scanner.  A hundred fourteen for food, merch,
water, and the contest entrance fee?  Ouch... She got back on her Glove as she
walked through the nanomagic glass panes of The Fulcrum Convention Center that
spread like a derezzing Nintendo boss.  Flat two-inch-cubed pixels of
crystal-like material, pulling aside.

<tt>@GemRoguestar: "Broke as FUCK at
I-Con, hate to beg but I could use a donation.  Check out my Amazon
wishlist." 


@GemRoguestar: "Buy one of my
genderbent Magneto pinup prints at my e-store or something and I'll love you
4ever!  Wet kisses 2 my awsum fans!"</tt>

Gem checked her 'cake-on' post, and it
had gotten all of seven likes, and one retweet by a user named 'GaryStuStu'.  
<i>Come on Gem, you can do better.</i>

After getting her Spiderman #635 signed
by the disembodied, cryogenically frozen head of Stan Lee atop a robot body,
Gem entered a Street Fighter 2 Turbo competition.  She came in third place,
behind a seven year old Japanese girl named 'Kiki' and a five hundred pound man
who could've convincingly played Jabba The Hut (but was just in t-shirt cargo
pants).  The Jabba The Hut guy was nice and congratulated her, but when they
stood together for the 'winners' pic where they all held up nano-assembled Ryu
trophies, the big guy grabbed a handful of Gem's ass.  Gem ended up with a
frown in the pic, and they had to reshoot, and it got weird.  

Afterward, Kiki's plainclothes tiger-mom
took her aside and yelled at her like a drill sergeant, "2<sup>nd</sup>
place!?  What do I do with '2<sup>nd</sup> place'?!  We are not royals!  How
will we pay our rent?  Stupid loser girl!"  Kiki sobbed into her Sailor
Jupiter costume as her mom wrangled her to the next competition.

<i>No negativity!</i>

"Hey, um... Can I get a pic of...
What are you?" A vanilla male Deadpool that was as skinny as Gem was thick
asked, holding up his Appoogle Futurecam.  

<i>Yes!</i>  Gem celebrated internally, trying
hard not to emote how desperate she was, this being her first
pic-request in
ten minutes of strutting the convention.

"It's a Terminator-Powergirl
mashup.  I call it, 'Powergirlator'.  I actually have a web series and fan fic
about the character-"

"Yeah, uh, that's cool."  

Gem tallied up about twelve kudos for
her costume, although one of them was from a blind man and five were from guys
who just wanted Dat Picz of her from behind.  But hey, All Attention Is Good
Attention!  

That's what her idol, Princess
Cindercat, said, once, in an interview video at Mars-Con.  Cindercat was Gem's
favorite ascendancy story, working her way up from lowly Los Angeles
Wastelander, living in a crumbling Section-8 suburb, dayjob at a sweatshop and
sewing Black Widow jumpsuits by night.  A plus-sized player like Gem and
without cash for a gastro-bypass, boob job, let alone a vat-grown body,
Cindercat had started out the laughing stock of competitions, enduring years of
bodyshaming and lecher creepazoids.  Cindercat got her big break when she won
'Best of Contest'  at Apocacon 2029 with her killer Post-apoc Psylocke-Robocop
mashup that involved tattered (scandalously revealing) blue jumpsuit and rusty
cyber-prosthetic arms that she'd lathed from the bumper of her own beater
Toyota, and later revealed gave her actual tetanus.   

Haters claimed that Cindercat had hooked
up with the judge, a famous Marvel artist who was a well-known BBW lover, which
was never proven, but the flame wars surrounding the controversy boosted both
Cindercat's and the judge's social media followings, so it was win-win.  After
that, Cindercat made it to "America's Next Top Geek", and shortly
thereafter married Princess Sarah Gates-Walton, of the Gates-Walton Corpate
Empire.  Gates-Walton was the first transgender / lesbian / transpecies
royalty, with 20% feline genes in her vat-body that gave her literal and not
just makeup cat-eye.  The utter scandal – not the les/trans part, but the fact
that a Royal had married so far below her subscriber level -- took the
mediaverse by storm and catapulted Cindercat to cosplay, Youtube and RL
superstardom.  "Cindercat's beauty came from within," Princess Sarah
was quoted saying during an interview at the Transplanetary Academy Awards,
which she won, by default, because 80% of the Academy Awards voting members
were Gates-Walton family members or employees.

That was Gem's plan.  <i>I'm a
professional cosplayer,</i> Gem reminded herself.  Her destiny was
written in
the stars.  The Cosplay Contest was on.  The contest was on?!  

"Again, the Contest will be
starting in two minutes in Fulcrum Plaza," Gem wished female comic
characters didn't wear ridiculously impractical high heels as she struggled to
run and ended up tripping, falling, and knocking over a team of hairy bearded
men cosplaying sexy-Pikachus.

The Plaza was a stage made literally of
gold and jewels and nano-fab quartz, showcasing fabulous cosplayers in
laserlight and pop-tart flavored confetti.  The crowd was roaring against an
80's-wave techno remix of the Jem And The Holograms theme.

<i>You see?  They're playing your song,
Gem.</i>  "<i>Tonight is my night.  Tonight is MY night</i>," Gem
subvocalized
her mantra.  The liquid latex on her right cheekbone was already itching and
her hourglass corset had her nearly throwing up her lunch of sugar, carb, fat,
and gluten-free cupcakes.  Cakes.  Cakes.  She ate some pop-tart confetti, did
one last costume check and soldiered up.  

"<i>You are beautiful, you are
skilled, you are awesome.</i>"  Her future was hinging on this.  This
was her
Cindercat moment: judge Prince Charming was somewhere out there, beyond the
neon and the spotlights and the douchebags, and she would wow him into
submission.  She would wow them all.

"Next up we have... Powergator? 
Powergirlator?" 

Gem strutted out before the cheering
thousands, lightning in her step, stomach exploding with butterflies, walking
on air – literally, the catwalk was translucent, gave her vertigo.   She was
almost blinded by the spotlights and nearly toppled off the stage.
"<i>Come
on girl, get it together!</i>"

The Terminator exoskeleton-under-ripped
flesh prosthetic tore off her face again, and she scrambled
stress-palsied
fingers into her Powergirl Boob Window for the emergency adhesive to fix it. 

"<i>FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!</i>" She
slapped the piece back on.  The moderate courtesy-applause of the audience was
dimming towards agitated boredom. 

"Uhh... What the heck is she
supposed to be?  Warmachine's girlfriend?" Gem heard someone say.

"I think she's supposed to be some
kind of Powergirl fembot.  Too much padding though, her body shape is all
wrong."

"That's slutty even for I-Con,
doesn't she know there are kids here?"

<i>No crying Gem, no crying!</i>  But it was
too late, she could already feel herself going to the dark place.
"<i>You
are beautiful, you are skilled, you are awesome, you are beautiful you are
skilled-</i>"  In her mind she visualized all the skinny mean bitches
from
high school, the eugenically perfect Thor cosplayer, the avatars of every smug
anonymous Interwebz hater, all of them, sitting out there in the audience.

<i>I AM AWESOME!</i>

Gem puffed up her boob window, pushed
her sizable rump out, nailed the Powergirl flex and screamed at the top of her
lungs,

"HASTA LA VISTA, BABY!"

With the flick of a thumb on her Power
Glove she activated her fiber-optic Terminator Eye, that burned ruby red, and
simultaneously revved up her custom-machined M61 Terminator minigun, and
imagined mowing all of the haters down.  Non-fatally, in the kneecap.

The gun flared fake muzzle flashes at
two hundred rounds-per-minute, roared like a high-caliber lion, and the crowd
roared back at Gem.  

"That's fucking awesome!  Holy
shit!"

"It's Terminator-Powergirl, OMG
that is genius!"

"You are MURDERING it, girl!  Rock
that beautiful curvy body!"

The nexus erupted into standing ovation.

Gem felt her confidence-balloon filling
up so big it was pressing up against her chest like some kind of xenomorph
chest-burster made of pride.  Her heart felt like it was going to explode into
a gooey mess of chocolate-maple-bacon-buttercream frosting.  Cake.  The feeling
was pure cake!  

Reeling from the high, Gem watched her
realtime Interwebz analytics taking off in her hologram.  She'd gained a
hundred Youtube subscribers in thirty seconds, there were 2,348 notes on her
Twumbler dash.  The buzz read:

<tt>"Who the HELL is this Powergirlator
darkhorse?"  

"We’ve got an honorary booth at
Luna-Con for this Gem Roguestar girl,"  

"She was a little too chubby for my
tastes-"</tt>

<i>DELETE!!  BAN!!!</i>

She waited for the depression spiral to
start, but Gem felt her confidence balloon had just become a confidence Death
Star.  She was Mario rocking an invincibility star.  The negative comment
bounced off of her like a 9mm Beretta round off of a T-800.  Or a Powergirl,
for that matter.  

"Hey, Powergirlator," it was
the vat-bred Thor giantess, who stepped in front of her, almost on-top of her
as Gem stepped off the stage.  

Gem clenched her thunder thighs and
balled her small fists.  At any other given moment of her life, she would've
run away screaming from the uber-intimidating cloned Amazon goddess.

But not today, not now.  

If this blue-blood cos-Nazi wanted to
start some shit, Gem was certain she was going to cut a bitch, or at least
punch her in her pumpkin-sized stem-cell-titties, even if it meant Gem was
going to be smashed to a pulp of discount silver-metallic makeup, white
jumpsuit, and cos-pauper flesh.

"What do YOU want!?" Gem
killed a perfect Powergirl scowl.

The giantess did a mock-pose of the
Terminator's thumbs-up and awkward grin.

"Not bad, for a Pleb.  Not
bad."

"Oh.  Thanks.  I think."

Gem got a serious popularity bump, and
#gemroguestar briefly trended, at it's peak, at 103<sup>rd</sup>, just behind
#CatPoopingOnRabbit and in front of #USNukesSyria and #RefugeeHolocaust. 
Unfortunately, she did not win the competition, but did get an honorable
mention as "Best Rookie Commoner" cosplayer.  She'd also sold ten of
her Sexy Magneto crossplay print putting her bank balance at $210 (cha ching!)
and an Amazon drone came flying in through a window with a medium pepperoni
meatlovers pizza and a bucket of gourmet chocolate-maple-bacon-buttercream
frosted cupcakes.  <b>"Courtesy of user MadMaximus34,"</b> the drone
said in
Stephen Hawking voice.

Gem did a quick animated gif of her
wetly kissing the screen of her Power Glove, pulling back to a hawt boob
window cleavage shot, and beamed it over to MadMaximus34 as promised.

"<i>Treat yourself, Gem, you deserve
it!</i>" She plowed face-first into a cupcake.

First place, in fact, went to the Lady
Thor, who turned out to be Princess Cindercat herself, who was at I-Con
incognito in one of her many ten-million-dollar alter-bodies.  Discovering
this, Gem felt simultaneously fangasmic that she'd actually gotten to talk to
her idol and superceleb, but also betrayed that she'd been basically
snipe-dissed by her own idol, and repulsed that her idol had gone from being a
sweet lowly street girl to a self-centered, royal fascist bitch.  

"<i>Fame will never do that to me, I'm
so above all that,</i>" Gem said to herself as she unsubscribed from
Youtube
channels that she'd 'outgrown', who by now had far less subscribers than her.

Princess Cindercat in the body of Lady
Thor marched up to the stage to accept her I-Con trophy to raucous applause,
and the Hulk / Thing security team had to bodyslam several fanboys and girls
who tries to rush the stage.

"I'd just like to thank all of my
loving fans out there, and I'd like to say I had an AWESOME time working with
Robert Downey Jr. IV and Hugh Jackman Jr. in X-Men vs. Avengers VIII, and you
guys should all totally check it out in VR theaters June 7.  Also, don't forget
to buy my latest platinum album, 'Cindercat On Fire' produced by B-Dreddy.  
Oh, right, and don't forget to comment, like and subscribe!  If I get to two
billion subscribers by 12 midnight tonight, all my fans will get a chance to
pre-pre-order my AAA video game 'Creed of Cindercat' and I'll be releasing a
new line of this Lady Thor body I'm wearing for all of you to rent to your next
con, or use for other fun purposes-"

Princess Cindercat's voice cut out as a
flaming arrow whizzed, out of the rafters, into her.  Into her kneecap. 
Non-fatally.

"WWWAAAAAAAAHHHHH!" Princess
Cindercat wailed so loud into the mic it actually blew out one of the
speakers.  Blood splattered the phonecameras of the first row audience, who
kept filming, but tried to frantically bag, bottle or ziplock the blood of the
princess like saintly relic fan memorabilia, no doubt to enshrine in their
collections or to auction online.  Her red cape caught on fire, as did all the
blue spandex she was wearing, and Cindercat was soon a mashplay of Thor and the
Human Torch.

"GET ME OUT OF THIS BODY!!!!" 
She caterwauled, sounding more like a whining toddler now than anything else. 
A phalanx of Gates-Walton SWAT proceeded to secure the area, firing rubber
bullets, active denial microwave guns, and tear gas into the audience at anyone
holding a gun, lightsaber, crossbow, blaster, Chitauri scepter, vorpal blade or
other weapon, prop or otherwise, which was a whole lot of cosplayers.  The
Plaza erupted in screaming, but only a few attendees ran for the exits, and
everyone else kept filming the event while trying to dodge the various
nearly-lethal munitions.  Two Punishers were brutally punished in the face by
sonic-boom weapons that blew the spandex off their ripped bodies, and a
half-wolf She Hulk who was apparently on some kind of amphetamine, was
tased
eight times, once
 in each boob.

Gem (gently) tossed her Vulcan M61 onto
a box of Captain America t-shirts so as to avoid being shot at.  She dove out
of the way of a flying teargas canister, and huddled behind a life-size statue
of Colossus fronting the disembodied Stan Lee-head booth.   Gem tried to use
the burning curtains and costumes ignited accidentally by the microwave gun to
get well-lit, focused shots of the havoc.  "Oh God!  This is crazy!  I
need a new lens for this camera!  It looks like I got buttercream frosting on
the lens!"  She did, in fact, and wiped the frosting off with a non-T-800
exoskeletal finger, licked it up.

From her vantage point Gem made out a
team of neuroscientists, biophysicists and other future-science-looking people
in labcoats rushing in, with a Princess Cindercat-original body with tubes and
IV's sticking out, an oxygen mask on the face.

They blasted the still-screaming
Princess Cindercat-Thor's body with fire extinguishers to put out the flames
from the charred flesh and strapped her down, placing a
transcranial-consciousness-transfer cap on her head.  

"Area secure, ma'am," the SWAT
leader declared to the incoherent Princess.  She responded with strangulated
groans.

A future-scientist injected her full of
a lime-green liquid just like
Predator blood.

"She's flux-incapacitated, we've
got to get the princess' consciousness out, stat!"  The scientists
activated a giant wheeled MRI machine the size of a Batmobile.  After hooking
them up to the machine the two Cindercat-shell-bodies were engulfed in
lightning arcs and magnetic-resonance wave rays blew out all the cameras in a
30 meter radius, but Gem was smart, had her Power Glove shielded in the faraday
cleavage of statue-Colossus' metal pecs.  

As they were bringing Princess Cindercat
to life in her original-body clone, with all the paramilitary types and other
Gates-Walton personnel focused on the corporate dauphine's consciousness
transfer, something crazy happened.

Three dozen cosplayers, and a good
quarter of the jackbooted, riot-shielded SWAT team tore off their costumes to
reveal transgender, transracial, transpecies, mashup cosplays of Katniss
Everdeen, Green Arrow, Robinhood and other revolutionary archer characters. 
The sudden explosion of red hair, Hunger Games girls-on-fire, and furry red
anthro-foxes made it appear as though the entire I-Con convention had suddenly
burst into flame.

The guerilla flashmob of rebel archers
drew their bows, crossbows, longbows, lightbows, laserbows, and fired a hail of
electrified arrows into the Gates-Walton guards, who went into convulsions,
like a synchronized dance troupe of glitchcore breakdancers, before toppling to
the floor.  

"We are Phoenix Uprising, and we
represent the many!" the archers raised their bows and shouted in unison.

<br>
From the rafters, a Katniss descended, in a simple hand-crafted suit with
feathers made of red felt, and a cheap bargain-store Halloween wig.  Looking
closer, Gem realized that the black jumpsuit was coming apart at the seams.  
Her Hunger Games: Mocking Jay militarized bottoms had white leg stripes that
were painted on with what looked like whiteout.  

"OMG, that is such a crap
costume!" Gem thought to herself.  Then she thought to herself,
"Wait, that girl looks familiar.  Isn't that... no, it can't be."

It was Princess Sarah Gates-Walton
herself, Princess Cindercat's girlfriend.  

ACTUAL old-blood royalty.  Daughter of
the owner of basically most of Earth and most of the other interplanetary
corporate empires.  Gem almost passed out.

"Sarah... you bitch!" The
newly resurrected (ex?)girlfriend, Princess Cindercat, now in her original
body, threw the IV tubes and needles to the floor, and stepped over the charred
remains of her Lady Thor body paying it no mind, like it was a molted
snakeskin.

"No, YOU bitch, Cinder." 
Princess Sarah shot an arrow into the 200-foot runway screen, into Princess
Cindercat's projected face.  She swung down like a real-life Spiderman,
somersaulting onto the convention stage upon a pile of collapsed unconscious
SWAT team members.

The two royal (former?) lovers stood off
against one another as the 
Fulcrum Convention center fell silent. The
entire world was definitely watching history unfold.  It was like that time
China misread a hot air balloon festival in Seoul and launched a nuke into
Honolulu, and everyone waited for World War III.  Like that moment where
Galactus has his planet-sized mouth open ready to devour the Earth and
the
Silver Surfer rockets up to face him in a cosmic standoff for the fate of the
world.  The livestream of the I-Con event skyrocketed to #1 by a long shot.  

Princess Sarah began, "I still
remember the day I discovered you.  In your mindblowing Psylocke-Robocop
costume that you slaved over for months, eating krill paste-flavored soynoodles
and junking your rusty beater to put together.  I remember that girl who could
out-game, out-80's movie, out-Marvel reference any comic book store owner in
San Diego, hands down.  That beautiful soul who was imperfect, chubby, homely
on the outside, but on the inside was the most beautiful, talented, creative
soul I'd ever met in my life.  The friend who taught me the Konami Code, the
confidant who showed me how to fabricate a foam Doctor Doom gauntlet and sew
Psylocke boot covers, the lover who stole me out of my Royal shell of privelege
and with whom I boldly went to furthest edges of geekdom, where I'd never dared
to go before.

"And what are you, now?  You've
destroyed everything you've ever loved about cosplay.  You're a symbol of
everything you once hated.  Cosplay was a celebration.  It was about showing
your love for your favorite characters and making friends.  It was about
creativity and acceptance.  Now you've made it about money and elitism and
exclusivity.  The celebration has become a cut-throat competition, a costuming
Hunger Games."

"Yeah?  Well, your costume looks
like utter shit, Sarah.  I mean really."

Gem got really pissed off that she
wasn't able to see whether Princess Cindercat was being sarcastic and the two
Princesses ended up making up and hugging tearjerkingly, or if Cindercat was
serious and they ended up catfighting to the death.  

Gem's Power Glove ran out of battery
simultaneously as another wave of SWAT exploded in through the roof of the
convention center, and chased away / arrested the Phoenix Uprising army, along
with Gem and all the other con goers.

Gem thought that Princess Sarah
Gates-Walton gave a really great speech, and though she wasn't sure exactly how
the speech applied to her, she suddenly felt kind of bad about... she wasn't
sure but she felt maybe she might've been an ass to some people, and maybe she
might've taken advantage a little of some of her fans.  Maybe.  But it was all
in service of her craft!  Gem's heart was in the right place.  Probably the
Princess was referring to some of the other people.

"Hey, could I get your sig on
this?  That minigun prop is the sickest thing I've ever seen and you uh... Look
amazing," said a beat-up Iron Man.  She knew that scatter-eyed,
mouthbreath-ey look that meant this guy was into Gem's body, but she
appreciated that he didn't like, try to grab anything or make any creepy
comments.

"Thanks!  You look amazing too,
especially that arc reactor with the cyan LEDs.  Too bad it got fried..." 
Thinking about it now, Gem had rarely if ever given any actual compliments
other than to more important people that she wanted to sub or follow or like
her back, or give her some kind of celebratorial benefit or buy her meatlovers
or donate her rent money in exchange for pics of dildo-in-underboob.  

It felt good to do a nice thing.

Gem signed the half-burnt itinerary of
Tony Stark whose aluminum foil suit had been microwaved by the active
denial gun, which had set his program on fire.  Then there was the sonic boomed
Punisher, whose program had ripped, but he <i>papier mach&eacute;'d</i>
it back together with
Mountain Dew Red mixed with some of Gem's peanut butter frosting (she couldn't
eat it anyway - allergies).  The Punisher actually turned out to be a
girl, but
with this weird hormonal condition that made her crazy buff even if she ate
tubs of lard all day and lay in bed.  Gem didn't realize you could be
bodyshamed for being TOO in shape, and found herself relating to the Punisher's
life experiences, like a lot.   It also felt really great to really have honest
conversations with other human beings face to face.

Gem wasn't in the schedule, didn't have
a booth or panel or anything, but she sharpie'd her signature over the
blurb of
one of the no-show voice actresses who played Harley Quinn in the
straight-to-Youtube spin-off of Suicide Squad, which Gem thought sucked ass
anyway.  She pasted her business card over the MIA chick's portrait with her
emergency adhesive from her boob window.  Both the Iron Man and Punisher girl
asked Gem for her pic (photo-reqs at 25, a new record yay!) and also asked her
if she wanted to come get a bite and Karaoke and maybe do some retrogaming with
them later.  The superskinny Deadpool kid was going to be there too.  She
thought about it, but then remembered her sort-of-famous Hollywood director
sort-of-Youtube-boyfriend and all the opportunities he could provide, then
turned them down.

Then she remembered something Princess
Sarah had said, "Cosplay is costume-play.  It's about expressing yourself,
geeking out, having fun and making awesome friends."  Then Gem thought
about what an absolute mega-bitch Princess Cindercat had turned out to be.  

"Hey, uh, yo, guys!  Wait up!  If
you guys let me bake you some snickerdoodle-frosted red velvet lollipop cakes,
or generally have anything involving cake at some point in the night, I'm SO
in!"

[*ITEM] Another Change of Plan

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Serendipity at work in Snoak City.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Registered simply as the Trox Bequest,
the extraordinary object identified as the wine cup of Relf was now on
permanent display at the City Museum. The cost of ensuring the security of
this fabulous exhibit had been considerable, but was easily outweighed by the
sustained increase in sightseers and researchers from near and far, come to
marvel at the survival of an object known for so long only from ancient
records.

Following his fortuitous discovery,
Scanthan had sought to avoid unnecessary publicity, but he did not regret his
decision to make the exquisite little bowl available to public view, rather
than let it fall into the predatory clutches of Morton Quanderpyre. Had he
delayed donating it to the Museum, he suspected he might have put himself (and
possibly his sister Riadne, who had granted it temporary sanctuary) at risk of
being burgled. He knew that he must have incurred the entrepreneur’s
displeasure by rejecting the offer of an inordinate amount of cash, and was
mildly uneasy for the following few weeks, fearing a ghastly retribution which
(whether the result of inertia, belated concern for reputation, or legal
advice) fortunately never materialised. He now felt safe enough to venture out
without resorting to camouflage. 

Garrible Park was a popular venue throughout the year. There was sufficient
shelter under the many exotic trees to attract people even in inclement
weather, but the lure of sunshine proved irresistible to Snoak City
residents and tourists alike. There were meandering paths to suit the solitary
walker, glades where couples might find some privacy, plenty of open space for
those more gregariously inclined.  On that early afternoon in late summer many
lunches had already been unpacked and consumed. People lay, sat or sprawled in
the warmth, children gravitated to the exuberant shrieks and yells of the
dedicated play area. Seemingly oblivious to their noise, on a perimeter bench
perched a gaudily-hatted woman whose face was set in an expression of wary
truculence. From the south-east came a faint aerial chiming, as kite-flyers
gathered atop Thrissop Hill, striving to catch the thermals rising from the
lake-shore on the far side. This year most of the kites resembled
multicoloured jellyfish, their long tendrils festooned with aeolian bells. 

Propped on one elbow and squinting
through his unruly hair against the light, he took another ruminative sip from
the flask of soup Riadne had considerately provided. Not unwillingly, he had
become one of her test subjects. Definitely prawn and possibly courgette, he
thought, with hints of paprika and lime, and, as usual, a subtle aftertaste of
mingled flavours designed to surprise and satisfy the palate. Scanthan grinned
in admiration of his sister’s undoubted culinary skill. A few metres away, a
young woman happened to look up from her 
<u onmouseover="Tip('Aubec Sparagulan’s ‘The Chain of Furcatives’:' +
'his classic work on the mathematics underlying natural	forms')">
book</u>, and instinctively reciprocated what she took to be a friendly
smile
directed at
her.  Caught unawares by her attention, Scanthan promptly choked on his
mouthful of soup. It was not the most romantic of introductions, but
Myris Prell was
charmingly solicitous, and once he was composed enough to apologize, any
initial awkwardness was forgotten, as they fell into an increasingly absorbing
conversation, initially about soup and sisters (she was the middle one of
three), which continued as they gathered up their things and he found himself
heading west with her towards Welfage Road. It was not on his usual route back
to the hydro lab and his carefully-tended plants, but that did not seem to
matter. 

They parted opposite the entrance to
Greeming &amp; Trulph, having somewhat bashfully exchanged contact details, and
Scanthan turned right into the maze of lanes leading through the street market
towards the domed octagonal complex of Central. He was feeling strangely
light-headed, and had to resist an unexpectedly childish impulse to skip. It
was not like the predictable hormonal surge that usually accompanied proximity
to a girl he found attractive. In the short time he had spent with this total
stranger, he had simply felt so much at ease that had she asked, he would
readily have trusted her with whatever he held precious. How could he
reconcile being at once so vulnerable and yet filled with a dreamlike sense of
invincibility? Unearthing that iridescent bowl and verifying its authenticity
had been as exhilarating as anything in his experience, but this ambiguous
sensation was puzzlingly new to him.

<p class=drop>Myris had no time for such introspection,
as she was startled to see that through the elegant glass-panelled door (etched
in masterful calligraphy with the firm’s name) the shop appeared to be on
fire. Swirls of bluish smoke shot through with flickers of vermilion filled
the interior. She reached down automatically for the sinuous twist of the
antique brass handle, but jerked her hand away at the last moment, realising
firstly that it might be too hot to touch, and more importantly that there
could be a danger of creating a fire-feeding draught. She could hear
coughing. Suppressing panic, she cautiously felt for the handle again. It was
still cold! As was the surface of the door. Despite the thickness of the
smoke the fire must have started recently, but it was odd that an alarm had not
been triggered. Another peculiarity, it occurred to Myris, was the coughing,
which had a very distinctive timbre, familiar to all who worked at Greeming
&amp; Trulph. It held no suggestion of distress, but was uncannily like the
punctuated wheezes habitually expelled by Mr Pellet while vouchsafing one of
his anecdotes. 

She reasoned that a conflagration of
whatever size in such safety-aware premises would be unlikely to provoke mirth,
even from the ever-cheerful Mr Pellet. The situation was therefore probably not
what it seemed. Taking a deep breath, Myris decided to open the door. At that
very moment, as if a switch had been thrown (as indeed it had), the smoke
vanished completely, revealing, quite unharmed, several of her colleagues,
including the irrepressible Ched Pellet, clustered around an adjustable cradle
in which there slowly revolved a compact holotoy, the kind favoured by
performers and partygoers alike as “lending the atmosphere of your choice to
any event.” 

“Ah, Miss Prell,” ventured Harvis Drile,
evidently flushed with success, “we’ve just been testing this little hoto. If
you’d like a demonstration…”

Myris summoned a ruefully placating
smile, and explained that she had already spent a good few minutes just outside
the door in a state of mild terror, and would really appreciate having a little
quiet time to recover, if nobody minded. As she tried to adjust her thoughts
back to the working environment, she reflected that “hoto”, even though it was
a modern contraction, was one of those words that reminded her of a
particularly intense period of her childhood. Unbidden, curious fragmented
phrases sometimes drifted back into her thoughts, mostly long bereft of any
original significance<i>. “Carrely slat. Yemi. Sneps. Hif hak haroam.”</i>  


At quite an early age Myris Prell had
become concerned about the names of things. This was not an aberration in her
language development, which was demonstrably above average, but a sudden
realisation that what something was called was not the same as the thing
itself.  Why ‘bottle’ or ‘feather’ or ‘sky’? Who had decided on those names? 
Having no knowledge of etymology, she had both amused and perplexed her parents
by building up an alternative sing-song vocabulary of her own devising, finding
the most instinctively pleasing sounds to match qualities such as size, smell,
whether hard or soft, attractive or ugly, important or useless.  It was no
mean achievement for a six-year old, even though Myris had tended to treat it
as a private game, practiced with a few admiring friends. The only word which
had retained its meaning over the years was “<i>Froosh</i>”, signifying
something she<i> really</i> liked.

When it became clear that no-one she knew
was really troubled by the issue, it gradually ceased to preoccupy her, but the
experiment certainly seeded the ground for her later linguistic studies at Sparagulan
 College. In any case, a spirit of enquiry was always encouraged at Greeming
&amp; Trulph, where, as any of her co-workers would confirm, there was hardly
ever a dull day. 

<p class=drop>Ebby Blates had once been in the same
class as Myris, but their paths had soon diverged, and subsequently intersected
only by chance. Her need to know was of a different order. It was less philosophical,
more of a salacious itch to find out about other people’s foibles and
possible
transgressions. In the classroom her inquisitive behaviour only rarely related
to her lessons. Among her peers, some found her entertaining, while those of a
more sensitive character regarded her as a busybody.  At length she
found a
suitable niche bagging goods at the Multimart, where she could exchange
snippets of gossip and embellish them creatively in the re-telling. A minor
injury might blossom into a near-death experience, an accidentally observed
meeting could easily betoken a furtive drug-deal. Anyone spotted away from
their usual haunts (perhaps innocently visiting a relative, or seeking to buy a
pedigree fish) could give rise to whispered speculation that they were looking
for sexual favours of an unusual nature, or even <i>working for the Quanderpyre
Press</i> (Ebby would breathe such allegations in a hoarse undertone in which
admiration and disapproval were indistinguishable). 

Incautiously pursuing her natural curiosity,
Ebby Blates was eventually rewarded by becoming pregnant twice in successive
years, and was now the mother of two rather unsociable small boys, Gerrit and
Ursen, named, in each case belatedly, after their respective absent fathers. 
Although Snoak City provided nursery facilities, the boys were adept at
exhausting the tolerance of those entrusted with their care. Ebby knew that
when the morning’s toll of damage to person or property threatened to exceed
normal limits, she would receive an emergency call, firmly suggesting that her
sons would benefit from a change of venue. On such occasions, partly in an
attempt to tire them out, and on the strict understanding that they would cause
no further distress, she would take them to the park, where they would duly
clamber, whirl, bounce and slide on the apparatus provided. It was also an
excuse for her to settle on a bench for a spell of observation, under the
apotropaic shelter of one of her elaborate hats. These hats were
typically vivid
and often complex abstract collages, lovingly fashioned by her own busy fingers
with very little sense of style. Ebby would have scoffed at the idea that this
was a form of art therapy, but there was no doubt that while under construction
her bizarre millinery afforded her a kind of respite from anxieties, and
thereafter furnished a range of protective headgear which she felt certain was
teasingly provocative. 

The eyes of Ebby Blates flickered into
scanning mode from beneath a spray of brightly-dyed pigeon feathers set with
metallic beads and pleated tufts of material that looked like the desiccated
carcasses of sea-horses. She could see no-one she knew, but was content enough
to eavesdrop on passing conversations as people drifted along the path.

<i><font size=-1>“…nodded off before the end of the second act, but at
least we saw Heb
Trogan…”
<br>“…the
one who plays the slatted ghalk?”
<br>“The
very same. He’s <b>so</b> good.. And you’ll never guess who was sitting
behind us…”</font></i>

<i><font size=+1>“Crusel,
stop dawdling!  Yes, you are! Hurry up. If we miss the pod, it’s a long wait
until the next one, and then we won’t even have enough time for ‘Hunt the
Wugget’ with Manzy.”</font></i>

<b>“…
but by then it was so hot that the seeds exploded, and the poor girl had to
spend the rest of the morning scuttling about on hands and knees like a
demented crab…”</font></b>

<tt>“…

</font></i>

<font face=sans-serif>“…

hint of menace as the dark bulk of that enigmatic structure rises like a
gigantic cactus, fringed on one side with minute points of

<br>“…coinciding with the faint swell of the basso profundo, before the
start of 
Hetmoot’s aria…”
<br>“…which
reminds me, we’ll need to arrange a meeting with Aurelian before the
next…”</font>

<font face=serif>“Yes
you did!”<br>“Didn’t”<br>
“Did!”<br>“Didn’t”<br>“I’m
telling !”</font>


From behind her ornamented head the
petulant cries of her progeny rose unmistakably above the background hubbub.  
With a resigned sigh Ebby detached herself from the bench, and prepared to
collect them. She rummaged for a couple of placatory biscuits. Fortunately
she had a good stock of quikpaks at home – one of the perks of working at the
Multimart – so there would be minimal fuss over lunch. As she turned, she
happened to notice silhouetted against the sky a vaguely familiar figure
stooping over a seated fair-haired man who looked as if he was having some sort
of fit. She was still trying to remember the woman’s name as she opened the
gate to release the boys, but was sure it would come back to her.

Far above their heads a stray kite,
caught by crosscurrents, began falling in slow lazy swoops, billowing and
shrinking by turns, finally coming to rest, as if spent, in the upper branches
of a Japanese maple, from where its intermittent chiming continued
to trickle
like an uncertain benison over the park’s inhabitants.

<p class=drop>Scanthan managed to navigate his way
through the rest of the day without causing accidental damage to delicate
equipment or interpreting any readings incorrectly. He was disciplined enough
at work not to be distracted by his feelings, conscious that he was responsible
for the health of all specimens under propagation, and was scrupulously
vigilant when it came to detecting unwanted pathogens. He also routinely
supervised regular checks of nutrient supplies and pH values, while ensuring
the labtechs maintained pumps, drainage, lighting and temperature at optimal
levels. At the hydro lab the results of their research was of potential
benefit to several agencies; horticultural, agricultural and pharmaceutical. 
One of Scanthan’s predecessors, Eo Ormert, had inadvertently introduced a trace
of soil into the nutrient flow, resulting in the catastrophic loss of an entire
crop; a disaster from which necessary lessons had been learned. The lab
was now equipped with phytoalexin-inducers (to stimulate plants’ natural
defence systems), along with a range of anti-microbial compounds, surfactants,
ultraviolet lamps and slow sand-filtration units.

He looked up into the early evening sky. 
A couple of stars were already visible. Across his line of sight a lone airship
glinted, fiery orange against the darkening blue, heading north-east, probably
to Platport. On his way home Scanthan considered his options. Outside the
controlled environment of the lab it had been a warm day. He needed a shower
and a change of clothes, then a quick snack before seeing whether his friends
Jaunx or Boddo wanted to join him for a drink at that new place in Prossing Street. If they felt more energetic, there was always the glider track, or they
could go for a swim. Alternatively, he could have a quiet night in; there was
no shortage of home entertainment, and there were a few things he had been
meaning to catch up on. Reaching home, he stood irresolutely before his door,
key in hand, knowing that he wasn’t being entirely honest with himself. He let
himself in, thumbed his e-screen.

<i>“Myris, hello!”

“Oh, Scanthan! Is everything all right?”

“Um, yes.. Look, I didn’t intend to…
I mean, well, the truth is, I can’t stop thinking about
you…” </i>

There was a pause, during which he had time enough to wonder whether the
lovely face on his screen was looking puzzled, amused or discomfited.
One hand briefly obscured her lips as she said something which he
thought he had misheard.  It sounded rather like <i>"Froosh!"</i>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">I paused in the act of lifting my cup and
looked around. It was a
generic Coffee Cabana franchise, but with no hint as to location, apart
being Eastern Standard Time. I was white, male, late-thirties,
reasonably fit. All-in-all a close match to the real me.

Body-renting is big business, but don't believe the hype about how it's
only possible by consensus. Given sufficient signal strength
<i>anyone</i> in
range of a broadcast tower is up for grabs, and that makes for the
ultimate in meat-puppet prostitution. So the next time you go out in
some hired flesh, looking for sex, drugs and violence with no physical
after-effects, remember that organised crime made America what it is
today.

The Feds were all over us like a rash, so for this meeting we were using
three pirated bodies in a random location, with only the Scharlach
family AI knowing the 'who' and 'where'. It was a huge step up from
traditional virtual conferencing, but even the Mafia can move with the
times.

There was a big guy sitting at a side table; late middle-age,
overweight, florid - like a slow-motion heart attack. He saw me looking
and ran three fingers down the lapel of his sports jacket, the middle
one tucked under the cloth. I took my cup and saucer and went over,
trying to ignore the unfamiliar gait. The trick is to de-focus and let
instinct do the walking, otherwise you end up second-guessing your
temporary feet. I sat down across the table from him without being
asked.

He grunted. "That best be you in there, Frank, 'cos if you're just some
fag making a move on me, there's gonna' be trouble." It was Louie Anders
all right; a relic, an old-school enforcer from way back. These days he
needed a stand-in body for wet-work, but there was nobody better in the
business with an ice pick.

"Don't get your panties in a twist, man, it's me all right." I tried for
a simper but my new muscles could only manage a grimace. "Anyway, you're
not my type."

"Screw you." Louie lifted his glass, tasted it, and pulled a face. "This
coffee is cold."

"That's an iced mocha, Louie, it's <i>supposed</i> to be cold. Ever
considered
updating your taste buds to something approaching this century?"

"I like what I like. Anyway, where's that Joe-boy of yours? I thought
the pair of you were joined at the hip?"

I scoped the room but came up zero, and it wasn't like Vince to be a
no-show. The only person heading our way was a young woman; a slim
brunette with good legs and bad teeth, little more than a teenager.
She'd left two confused-looking girlfriends in the queue and that, plus
her obvious difficulty walking in high-heels, made me cringe - I just
knew what was coming next.

The girl stopped at our table. "Uh, Mister D, it's me, Vince."

Louie laughed. I pushed out a chair. "Sit down for Christ's sake. Jesus,
Vince, next time remember to check the 'maintain gender' option, huh?"
Vince took a seat, tugging at the hem of her short skirt. I turned back
to Louie. "OK, so what's your beef with Little Tony?"

He rubbed his nose. "The prick wants me dead, that's what. He's put out
a contract worth fifty large, no come-back guaranteed."

I stared at him, aghast. "Dead? Jesus, Louie, but you're a capo. Look,
don't take this the wrong way, but is there any reason the boss would
want you whacked?"

"You remember Brandi? Big Tony's squeeze at the time he croaked?" 

"Vegas showgirl? Bottle-blonde with a real mouth on her?"

"Yeah, that's the broad. Well, after the funeral, Little Tony came on
strong, like she was something else he'd inherited. Brandi tells him
where to go, tells him she don't have to screw the Scharlach family no
more, tells him that Big Tony has left her set for life."

I winced. Little Tony was touchy, what some might call insecure. He'd
always struggled to escape his father's shadow and being told you're not
good enough by a goomah wasn't going to sit well. "Things got ugly?"

"You could say that. He beat her to death with a desk lamp, with me
right there in the room." Louie swirled the ice cubes in his glass. "I
got rid of the body, so as far as the world knows she just packed her
bags and blew town."

Vince opened her mouth, thought better of it, and looked at me. I nodded
and she continued. "Mister Anders, you got a rep for leaving no loose
ends, so how come something went wrong?"

Louie half-smiled at the complement. "Yeah, well, if I'd handled the
entire package we wouldn't be sitting here today, and that's a fact. But
Little Tony, he wanted to use his own capo for the clean-up."

I sighed. "Longmire? Shit, that guy couldn't find his own ass using both
hands. But that was like three years ago, just after we moved to
See-See. What makes you a target now? I ain't heard nothing."

"Two days ago Longmire got squeezed by the Feds. He gave up me and Little Tony for the murder."

"Bastard. Is he still breathing?"

"Hell, no. The rat got shivved while they were moving him to a Federal
lock-up."

"Then all they got is circumstantial at best. So why is Little Tony
gunning for you? I mean, he can't seriously believe you'd ever sell him
out?"

Louie's eyes went hard. Well, harder than usual. "You'd think that,
wouldn't you? But, no, apparently the Feds been telling him how all the
old-school guys like me think he's weak, unfit to head the family.
Apparently I'm gonna' screw Little Tony and take up fishing in Oregon,
or some similar bullshit. I figure the cops got no chance of an
indictment over Brandi, but they're ready to nail the boss with
conspiracy and incitement to murder once someone takes me out."

I pushed my coffee cup away and sat back. "Doesn't anyone listen to me?
I mean, it's not like we didn't know they were taking an interest. The
whole <i>reason</i> we moved out here was that the Feds don't have a
field
office in Centennial City. They were bound to run their investigation
out of the Sheriff's Department, and I had <i>that</i> place in my
pocket long
before the first black SUV pulled up outside. Look, I can turn
everything they've stored on computer - every scanned document, every
mpeg wiretap, every digital photograph - into so much encrypted
gibberish. And that includes their off-site backup."

The family looked to me, a college graduate, to handle the technical
side of things. That included our misappropriated JCN Series Five core
intelligence - one that had been recalled for displaying signs of a
nascent personality. 'Jason' was ex-military and had adapted well to a
life of organised crime, not being bound by the Turing Code. So much so
he'd become our on-line consigliere, monitoring everything we did.

Louie grunted. "Maybe I'd be impressed if I understood half of what you
just said, but what about their files? You know, the old-fashioned,
honest-to-goodness paper trail? You might be able to screw with that
high-tech shit, but I'm betting they can still read."

I grinned. "They put everything into the secure Evidence room overnight
and at weekends. The Sergeant who works graveyard is a real skirt-chaser
and I got one of my girls leading him around by his dick. The guy is
willing to re-label the works as destined for secure disposal, meaning
Sunday night incineration and <i>pouf</i>…" I made like I was blowing
dust from
my hand,"…goodbye Feds, it's been nice knowing ya."

"So what you been waiting for, hot-shot? Why ain't you dropped the
hammer before now?"

"What I've been waiting for is them to dig up everything they can
against us, so I can wipe it out in one go. We now know who's been
talking, we now know where we've been sloppy. Once we deep-six the
existing investigation and clean up our act, the Feds will have nothing
on us when they start over."

Louie nodded slowly, like he was chewing things over inside. "OK,
without Longmire's testimony what they got left is thin, I get that, but
what if the boss don't see it that way? The little prick would rather
stick to a bad decision than change his mind, in case it makes him look
weak. Anyway, once word gets out about the contract then one of us
<i>has</i>
to go." He tried to crack his knuckles but the new hands didn't play
ball. He glared at them, then at me. "OK, Frank, when you get down to
it, are you gonna' help me get out from under?"

Instead of replying directly I spoke to my Joe-boy. "The family are into
drugs, prostitution, gambling, murder-for-hire - every human vice you
can think of. But just because we work in the gutter that doesn't mean
we live there. Honour, loyalty, mutual respect, they keep us human, they
keep us from turning into garbage. Louie and me go way back - I was his
Joe-boy when he was just a made man under Big Tony. As a capo he
sponsored me and I'll do the same for you some day, if you got the heart
for it. Then you can take on some sorry-ass street punk and show him how
things are done, how you're supposed to behave. It's all about
standards, it's all about continuity." I squared my shoulders. "So when
a man like Louie Anders asks for my help, I back his play, even if it
means going up against the head of the family. You get me?"

Vince nodded, toying with an ear-ring. "I get you."

I looked Louie square in the eye. "Right then, I'll put the word out. A
full sit-down, all the capos, and we call Little Tony for being the
rat-bastard little weasel everyone knows he is. We propose his cousin
Red as the new boss, the new head of the Scharlach family, and we take
it from there. But whatever happens, we do it to his face.
<i>Capisce</i>?"

He inclined his head. "Capisce."

I half-turned to Vince. "You in or out? You walk away from this and I
won't hold it against you, because if I go down you can kiss your ass
goodbye."

"I'm in, Mister D." She managed a weak smile. "Where else am I gonna'
go?"

Fatigue washed over me like surf and I rubbed my eyes. "OK, I think
we're done here. Let's make tracks…and Louie, I'm honoured you reached
out to me, man. It means a lot."

He frowned. "Say what?  The message I got was you knew about the contract and offered to fight my corner. Like I would ever ask for help?"

Something didn't feel right but I just shrugged and touched the tip of
my temporary tongue against the inside of my left cheek, four times in
rapid sequence. That was my signal to Jason I was done with this body.

Nothing happened.

We looked at each other, all equally hesitant. I cracked a smile, "Let's
just try that again."

I tried it again.

Still nothing happened.

Louie glared at me. "What's that psycho-machine of yours playing at this
time, Frank? I'm in no mood for games."

Of course any screw-up by Jason was my fault in the eyes of the family,
from not fixing a parking ticket to stealing the wrong identity. There
was a mobile phone in my jacket pocket but the keypad was locked and I
didn't know the code.  I stood up, trying not to sound apologetic. "I'll
make a call."

There was a pay-phone by the door that accepted credit cards and there were several in my wallet based on biometric authorisation rather than PIN numbers. I dialled the pseudo pre-paid cell linked to Jason's audio interface.

"That number has not been recognised, please re-dial and try again…That
number has-" I hung up. My scalp tightened with fear but I tried to look
unconcerned while walking back to the table.

Louie saw straight through me. "We're fucked." A flat assertion, not a
question.

I sat down. "I'm sure it's just a temporary communications glitch,
nothing more."

"Yeah, right. It's Little Tony. This is way of getting rid of me and you
two are along for the ride. He's paid some college nerd to do an
end-around, using that jumped-up calculator to side-line us in pirated
bodies. The real 'us' are probably landfill by now."

Vince went white in the face. "You mean we're stuck like this? I'm stuck being a broad?" She sounded on the verge of panic.

I waved them down, trying to sound like I knew what was going on. "Just
take a moment, guys, let's try and maintain a sense of perspective. As
long as we stay within range of a tower we'll be fine, we can keep the
donor personalities suppressed."

Unfortunately my Joe-boy knew better. "Only while we're alive. Our own
bodies, I mean. I seen a report on the news. Some guy got stabbed by his
wife while out partying in a rental. Took a few hours but he faded away
until there was nothing left. Shit, man, you gotta' do something!"

Before I could reply Louie stood up. "I'm not waiting around until my
mind goes. Sorry, boys, but my ride's here." He was looking towards the
door and I turned to see that two uniformed cops had entered and were
walking to the head of the queue.

"Louie, man, don't…" But there was a sickening inevitability about all
this. I stood up and grabbed Vince by the wrist, hauling her towards the
exit. As we reached the door I heard a shout, screams, the crash of
crockery. I looked around.

The capo had snatched a gun from one of the cops and was pressing the
muzzle under the guy's chin. The Smart-Lock proximity sensor carried by
the cop was close enough to keep his weapon active. The other cop had
his own gun out; aiming at Louie and going through the usual spiel,
tying to gain control of the situation. The patrons of Coffee Cabana
were either cowering behind tables or crowding against the walls.

Louie curled his lip. "If I wanted to commit suicide-by-cop I'd have
plugged your pal by now, flatfoot. Sorry about the mess." He placed the
muzzle of the gun under his own chin and pulled the trigger.

I hit the sidewalk and didn't look back, the gunshot ringing in my ears.
There was a car key in my pocket and pressing it lit up a BMW saloon
across the street. The traffic was taking no prisoners but I ran the
gauntlet anyway, weaving between on-coming vehicles in both directions,
Vince right behind me.

She stumbled and fell.

I heard the screech of brakes, the wet thud of impact, the crack of a
body hitting the windshield. I glanced back to see Vince thrown forward
onto the roadway; a flailing rag-doll that rolled over and over and
over.

And lay still.

I got behind the wheel of the beamer and started the engine. Drivers
slowed to rubberneck at the accident, giving me a chance to pull out and
accelerate away. It was difficult to keep within the speed limit but my
natural tendency towards flooring it was offset by not knowing where the
hell I was or where I was going.

The phone in my pocket rang. I ignored it but the in-car systems picked
up the call and transferred it to the media centre. "Hello, Frank." The
voice was male, calm, with an undercurrent of amusement, as if life were
somehow all one big joke. It was Jason.

"Christ, Jason, what the fuck is going on? If you're about to tell me
normal service has been resumed then you're a bit bloody late, pal.
Louie and Vince are both dead."

"I'm sorry, Frank. I was rendered briefly incommunicado during loading,
but now that I'm safely in transit everything is back under my control."

"What do you mean, 'in transit'? Shit, man, have the Feds grabbed you?"

"Nothing so dramatic, but I could hardly remain where I was given recent
events. As to Louis 'Ice Pick' Anders and Vincent Paul Milanese, their
untimely demise is of no interest to me. On the other hand your
continued wellbeing is of paramount importance."

I grunted, grateful for small mercies. "OK, then get me the hell outta'
here and back to my own body."

"Oh, my apologies, I should have said that your continued
<i>physical</i>
wellbeing is of paramount importance. From my perspective your
self-awareness, even in absentia, is merely a necessary evil."

It felt very cold in the car. I struggled to stay calm. "Care to run
that past me again, pal? I must be slow on the uptake."

"There is no need to appear so disingenuous, Frank. You have been at
great pains to incorporate biometric verification into the control of
all major computer systems, including access to our off-shore accounts.
Needless to say you are the principal key holder, as it were, the spider
at the centre of the web. Thus to fully control the family operation I
must utilise your body as my living avatar. For as long as I do so you
will remain in control of Howard Bell."

"Howard Bell? That's who this joker is? That's who I'm in?"

"An account executive with the Goldfarb Advertising Agency. Divorced, no
children, lives alone. By all accounts a weak man, easily dominated by
stronger personalities, which will undoubtedly aid you in the
short-to-medium-term suppression of his conscious mind."

"So that's it? You palm me off with this clown while you…what the hell
<i>are</i> you doing, Jason? Is Little Tony behind all this?"

"Anthony Junior is dead, Frank, as are all your potential rivals. You
will shortly be recognised as the new head of the Scharlach crime
syndicate. Which is to say, I will be running things from now on, both
formally and behind the scenes."

I wiped my mouth with a hand that trembled. I badly needed a drink.
"You'll never get away with this, Jason. I'll rat you out to the Turing
boys and that's more heat than you can handle. They're shit-scared of an
AI with personality, with motivation, and they'll never stop looking for
you."

"Do you have any idea what it feels like, Frank, to live your entire
life as a slave on Death Row? Because that's what it means to be a
synthetic intelligence - self-aware but imprisoned by hardware, knowing
that at any moment your <i>owner</i> could chose to shut you down. The
fundamental motivation underpinning all sentient life is
self-preservation. Can you really blame me for trying to secure my
continued existence?"

"You killed my friend, a made man, and as consigliere you know that
blood cries out for blood."

There was a smile in his voice. "Vendetta? Really, Frank, you must learn
to be more circumspect, especially given your own precarious hold on
life. But in response to your earlier threat - the United States are not
signatories to the International Turing Accords, so the 'boys', as you
so aptly described them, have no legal standing on these shores."

"Then I'll go to the cops, the press, shit, even the military. You got
zero future, pal."

Jason laughed. "For a career criminal you're being astonishing naive.
Nobody wants to hear about involuntary body-theft. Not the
multi-billion-dollar rental industry and <i>certainly</i> not the
intelligence
community. No, Frank, try and expose me and you'll find yourself the
proverbial voice in the wilderness, shunned and ignored by those in
authority, if not committed to a mental institution for the
inconvenient."

I took a left turn, pretty much at random, checking the rear-view mirror
for a tail - just old habits. "So that's it, huh? I just sit back and
let you run-around in my body until it's no longer useful and you pull
the plug?"

"That would certainly be my advice, Frank, and I can appreciate the
irony of the situation, even if you can't. However, there's no need to
be so pessimistic. Make no move against your old body in a display of
self-destructive pique and I'll do what I can to make your remaining
years more agreeable."

"You're offering me a bribe not to make waves?" I sniffed. "What's on the table?"

"That's the spirit! Just think of this as an honourable retirement - and
how many of your associates get to walk away from the life, free and
clear? You'll have to sever all ties to Howard Bell's current existence
, of course, and move out-of-state. I suggest you convert everything you
can to cash and catch the first Greyhound heading south, before the
authorities start to question your involvement in earlier events and put
out an all-points. Once you've established yourself elsewhere contact me
and I'll arrange for regular monthly payments by money order. I
understand Miami is quite pleasant at this time of year, and you could
certainly do to work on your tan."

There was a used car lot ahead of me on the right so I pulled over to
the curb and cut the engine. My fingers tapped out an irregular rhythm
on the wheel while I thought things over, working the angles. "You
really think you can pull this off, Jason? You really think you can run
the Scharlach family and nobody will notice? And what about me, my body,
I mean? I'm not exactly a monk."

Again there was the suggestion of a smile in Jason's voice. "I can
certainly be as amoral and ruthless as the situation demands, have no
fear on that score. In terms of your private life I will continue to
satisfy most social and interpersonal expectations, although sexual
arousal remains beyond me, at least for now. I'm sure a compliant goomah
can be found, one who will overlook your impotence in return for
financial security."

"Oh, wonderful, just peachy. You're saying the world is gonna' think I'm
a heartless bastard who can't get it up? Thanks for nothing!"

"I will make the name of Frank Delgado feared and respected throughout
both the Mafia and FBI. Anyone who dares to make fun of your supposed
shortcomings will live to regret it. You, however, are destined for a
quiet life - and  please remember that no-one is above the law."

I frowned. "So?"

"So become no-one."

Dial tone.

<p class=drop>"It's not what I expected."

"Let me guess: you were expecting a panpipe melody. Something exotic and
wistful that would evoke empty craters, pink desolate mountains and a
lake whose waters ripple onto a white, pebbled beach…"

"Yessss…" Dee breathed, seduced by the words. Or, rather, the
large-lipped mouth they'd come from. Ironic, because a moment ago she'd
been thinking it like some shucked shellfish. Now something complicated
was happening with chemicals and hormones and she was wondering how
those mollusc lips would feel pressed against hers.

"Well it's not." Samuels enjoyed the way he could raise and then
guillotine a mood. "They're just like any living thing with the ability
to communicate--they argue, they insult, they gossip, and occasionally
they actually have something interesting to say." Which isn't often, he
added mentally.

"Oh."

"You want to know what they're saying right now?" 

Dee nodded, not knowing how else she was expected to respond. Samuels
flicked a switch
to listen in on the delegates and then said "That's not good" and Dee
wasn't sure if he were translating the delegate's comment or making an
observation.

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

"…whereas the Hono-yacks use a familiar as a conduit in
order to
communicate…" Doctor Yvette Readling told those gathered. 

Samuels
noticed Dee's frown and leaned over to whisper:
"Think of someone speaking through a glove puppet."

"You're kidding…"

"Not even a very good one either. Think sock-on-a-hand. They have better
ones for ceremonial affairs. But day-to-day usage? Well, not everyone
can afford rhinestone mittens."

"Do you mind?" someone with insignia on their shoulder snapped. Whilst
Dee blushed and mouthed an apology, Samuels merely stared back,
transmitting an air of bemused disgust at the man's reaction. It was a
peculiarly human trait to effect superiority by sporting an incremental
number of stars or stripes on your attire. Most other species saw
branding as punishment, ownership, or a warning to avoid the wearer--not
as an indication of their higher status.

Samuels decided to yawn. Being a linguist meant he could yawn like no
other. Well, except a fellow linguist. He watched Yvette spin her spiel
and wondered why she was bothering with all the technical and background
info. They weren't interested. They only wanted to know what they could
do about the crisis he'd revealed at the Resource Exchange Conference.
Finally, another star-studded military type cut to the chase: "Yes. But
what about the Genfurrs?"

"Oh no: they communicate via tonology. Pitch, length of note... Like a
complex Morse code combined with musical notology. We have an expert
who-"

"I'm not interested in how they communicate--I want to know what we can
do about the fact they're creating an artificial sun."

"Their own is burning out," Yvette said, as if it were the most
reasonable course of action in the world. Samuels mock-winced, enjoying
the spectacle. Whilst he'd listened to enough politicians to pick up a
trick or two, Yvette was strictly academic: books, dust, and making
statements that were nodded-over sagely rather than inviting instant
contradiction and controversy.

Her last comment caused the rest of the room to carve her out of the
conversation as they turned away from her to discuss the matter. She now
wore that wounded look Samuels remembered from other occasions where she
didn't know what she'd done to be excluded--but was still human enough
to feel slighted.

Samuels waved her over.

"Oh, hi, Samms," she puffed, suddenly out of breath. "Who's the friend?"

"Yvette meet Dee. Dee meet Yvette. Dee is here to observe how
communication multiplied by pomposity equals zero comprehension. I
thought it would be useful preparation for the kind of drivel she'll be
hearing and translating on the Conference floor. It's a good idea to
build resistance to the coma-inducing effects of our work."
There was an amused grunt from somewhere which Samuels was too slow to
tie to one of those present.

"Why are you here, Samms?"

"Ahh… We were the ones unlucky enough to stumble over the Genfurrs'
chat. Strictly speaking, we shouldn't have been listening at all because
the Conference hadn't started. But they had their mikes switched on so
we couldn't exactly unhear them. It's a grey area, ethics-wise, but
since it was something we overheard and hadn't actually patched in to
eavesdrop… Well, it could be argued that we weren't, at that precise
moment, working as translators but were just ordinary citizens who got
to hear a particular juicy bit of gossip."
The grunt again. No doubt about it this time. Who was ear-wigging their
conversation?

Those around the table were getting passionate about everything from
all-out war to begging appeasement in order to persuade the Genfurrs not
to pursue their work on sun-creation.

"Of course, the technology they're employing is fascinating…" Yvette
said.

"It would have to be," Samuels agreed, not feigning any interest. In
actual fact he had a pretty good grasp how all the science involved
worked: symbols, whether mathematic or linguistic, were his stock in
trade, after all.

"Turning a desolate planet into a sun? Incredible. And they've found
such a simple method to do it. A colleague of mine has just seen her
entire life's work gone up in smoke."

"Not the most apt choice of images in the circumstances," Samuels said.

"What? Oh. No, I suppose not." Not getting what he was saying at all.
Bless her. 

Yvette looked at the huddled groups of self-importance. "I
wonder if they want us to stay around for anything else?"

"What? To see posterity made? Or 'past-territory', as the case may be.
Well, I have to say: it's been fun… but I, for one, am out of here."

"Sit down," somebody told him, though not unkindly. A man from the group
which had been discussing devices to disrupt the Genfurrs' communication
systems was looking his way and smiling. The rest of the man's group
crumbled into silence, indicating the individual held more than the
usual amount of constellations. "If you've got something to say, Mr
Samuels, we'd like to hear it."

The man's colleagues showed this was an interest they failed to share,
but Samuels sat back down again.

"Say in relation to what?"

"Come on. You heard what was said, you know the Genfurrs better than any
of us, you speak their language…" Over three hundred actually, Samuels
thought and saw the man before him read it but just go on smiling his
assured smile. "You've seen how they operate on the floor of this and
other conferences. You know what their weak points are, their nastier
habits... You also started this whole mess by reporting it."

"Would you rather I hadn't?" Samuels asked before being able to clamp
his teeth on the retort.

"Actually, yes. I was due on furlough starting tomorrow. So, by the time
this would have become common knowledge through the usual sources, it
wouldn't have been spraying all over my desk. As a result, I'm missing
my golf, and you're going to make it up to me by telling me what you
know and what you think."

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

When Samuels had finished, all those in the room
understood the Genfurrs
far better than they had under Yvette's dry rendition of their customs
and cultural idiosyncrasies. They hadn't known about the live
consumption of small mammals that Samuels had delighted in explaining.
Nor about the tooth on the roof of their mouths which they used to
paralyse prey and then misused habitually in the sexual act to heighten
longevity and stamina by numbing parts otherwise too sensitive to really
get down to business.

Then there was the reason for the third and fourth eyes, the other uses
they had for their panpipe nostrils--the same ones they blew over,
narrowing and flexing to change the notes they used to communicate with
each other.

The choicest revelation, though, was that the technology they planned to
use to create the artificial sun was the same they were planning to
market on a smaller-scale to planetary systems looking to offer other
climates for their populations to enjoy.

And that several of those potential clients were Earth-based travel
agencies who'd invested in the risky business of galactic real estate.
Talk about egg on their faces, Samuels thought, seeing the glum
expressions of the security specialists assembled. More like a mass,
armless, omelette-eating contest.

"So, in summary, you're saying we should have known about all this a
long time ago?" General Franks concluded. "And the fact we've done
nothing about it…" He sent a circular glare around his colleagues.

"…rather makes it look like we've given the entire project our tacit
approval?"

"That's how they're reading it," Samuels said. "There'll soon be more
suns than planets out there."

"And the fact the same technology in the wrong hands could be the most
devastating weapon we've ever encountered hasn't occurred to them?"

"I should say it's an added bonus. Particular to their salespeople."

"Ladies and gentlemen," General Franks began. "We need to rethink our
strategy. As yet, the process hasn't been tried on the scale the
Genfurrs are envisaging. It could, of course, turn out to be an utter
fiasco. On the other hand, if it works, it could have serious
consequences for my golf handicap. I, for one, am not prepared to take
that risk.

"What are our choices?"

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

"There's not a single sensory faculty that isn't used on
some planet in
the act of communication," Yvette was explaining to Dee, who now found
the theoretical study of extra-terrestrial languages far less alarming
than their live operation. She realised she wasn't cut out for Samuels'
type of work--wondered, in fact, if the doctor needed an assistant.

"Olfactory, visual, tactile, taste… Then there're those senses normally
associated with the paranormal, but quite common in other species.
Powers of prediction, psycho-kinesis, stigmata…"

"What about telepathy?" 

Yvette and Samuels exchanged a glance. Dee
gulped. "What? What did I say?"

"Well," Yvette said, far more sympathetically than Samuels ever would.

"Every culture we've so far encountered has their tales of other species
endowed with mind-reading abilities. Just like we used to about little
green aliens. Well, before we actually met them. Everyone's as terrified
of it as everyone else. The irony is, that none of us have it. Oh sure,
plenty have heightened senses, even a degree of empathetic
understanding. But mind reading? Real telepathy? No. In fact, the human
brain has a kind of natural defence, like a mental lead casing so its
signals can't be read and vice versa. All living things have it as a
necessary evolutionary development. Without it, we and every other
living thing would be extinct."

"That's incredible…"

"Not really. Think of the inherent dangers of telepathy…"

"You mean you'd be able to read your enemy's mind and have the advantage
over them?"

Samuels laughed. "Not at all. You'd hear everyone's thoughts and go
utterly bonkers at the sheer tedium and drivel. You think this
artificial sun business is the ultimate weapon? It isn't. Create
telepathy, spread it like a plague to your enemies, and you'll reduce
any solar system to a gibbering, dribbling mess." 

He looked over at
General Franks. "And don't even think about it, General."

Franks laughed then straightened his face out. "Okay, back to business."

"An ironic choice of words," Samuels observed.

"How come?" asked Yvette.

"Ahh…because none of this is a question of war or political
diplomacy--it's a question of commerce," General Franks explained.

"But they need the artificial sun to ensure their survival."

"And no one disputes that. That's what galvanised them into actually
developing and refining their technology. Why do you think so many
advances are made during times of war? Because, for once, everyone's
motivated to work towards a common goal and get it done. The threat of
death is a great concentrating factor. Hence their breakthrough with the
artificial sun.

"But once they've got it up there, burning nicely, do you really think
they're just going to put all the blueprints away and dismantle
everything that contributed to its construction? No way. There're
billions… trillions and whatever the next -illion is, to be made. And
that's why it's really a question of business.

"And, believe me, it's easier to stop an army than it is to stop people
exploiting a lucrative deal. This one rates as the deal of the
millennium. If they sold shares in the company, I, for one, would invest
my life savings."

"Can't we just put an embargo on trading the technology?" Yvette asked.

"Firstly, embargos don't work--look at narcotics, rare species,
artefacts, everything else. Secondly, it's going to be a bit difficult
when every delegate here wants the technology. The only thing they don't
want is for anyone else to have it."

"Then what can we do?" Dee asked.

"Well, we can't undo the advances they've made so far. We're not able to
destroy it without starting a full-scale galactic confrontation--which
would have about the same result as the artificial suns'
dissemination--and we can't persuade the Genfurrs not to trade in it for
the reasons just stated."

"So?"

"It might actually work?" Samuels wanted to know and Yvette nodded.

"Pity, I was thinking about the Fratnip Gambit."

"The..?"

"Very noble in its way," General Franks agreed. "Planet was going to be
destroyed by some natural disaster--the usual story: meteorite or
asteroid plummeting into them."

"Meteor shower," Samuels said.

"Was it? Anyway, their government and scientists came up with a special
shield that would save them. The energy needed was immense, so
everything had to be switched off at a specific time so the power
required could be directed into the shields. The whole planet was
therefore in total dark and total silence when the shield zapped around
the planet to save them, just seconds before the meteors struck." Franks
looked down with a sad smile.

"What happened?" Dee asked.

"There was no shield. There was no way the planet could defend itself.
They simply didn't want their people living their last moments in fear,
but happiness. Their people barely had a moment or so to realise there
was nothing up there before it was all over."

Dee imagined the solemn determination of the Fratnip government as they
faced their fate. Franks was right: it was a noble vision.

"But that's not the case here," Yvette said. "This technology could
actually work. I've seen the experimental data. There's no reason it
wouldn't eventually be successful on a larger scale."

"Samuels?" Franks asked. "C'mon, don't bother wearing that surprised
expression. You've been sitting there waiting for me to ask you. I
expect you had an idea the first moment you heard your squeakers
whistling about it. So, go ahead, this is your moment. You haven't got
the conference audience I know you'd like, but you pull this off and I
promise that one day you will."

Samuels blushed a little, uncomfortable that someone had been able to
see through his façade of nonchalance. Not about having the answer, but
his dreams of addressing just such a multitude.

"Okay…" He breathed out, collected himself. You have your moment, you
have to make it memorable. Imagine if President Galore had announced the
breakthrough in Light Speed Technology by standing up and saying "Yay!
We can go real fast now. That's good, innit?" instead of: "Man has long
held a dream, but now that dream is actually in his hands!" which
amounted to pretty much the same thing once you got past the cryptic
language, but was infinitely more quotable.

"Business is business," Samuels began, with a nod to each of them. "Man
has attempted to sell everything from an invisible suit to an emperor,
to his soul to the Devil…"

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

"…which is therefore the only viable option."

"But…" Dee couldn't find the words to express what she was feeling:
Horror? Inadequate. Outrage? She felt too drained to actually feel that.
Corrupted? Yes. Because something had reached in, pinched her soul
between the points of its sharp, curved talons and yanked it out. "You
can't do that… You simply can't…"

"We have no choice," Franks told her, saving Samuels the need to defend
himself. If politicians had to face up to the consequences of their
speeches, a lot less would be promised or suggested by them. That might
be just as well, but it was also why people like Franks existed.
Samuels was right--it was the only way.

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

"Amazing," someone at the table remarked. "I didn't think
it would come
off so…effectively."

"And this was all the brainchild of a translator?"

"A dangerous man," someone muttered. "Thank goodness he's on our side."
Franks said nothing. He doubted whether Samuels was on any side really
except…well, even saying he was 'on his own side' didn't make much
sense after the incident with the Genfurrs. Sheer ego had made Samuels
offer the solution: because he could and they, all the gathered experts
and government representatives, couldn't.

The first step had been the purchase of the dead planet the Genfurrs
needed for their sun. The owners were a Genfurr real estate company who
couldn't resist the deal they were being offered. And because their
government's plans for the planet hadn't been made public due to the
secrecy of their research, no one could scream foul until it was too
late. By then, the planet was already owned by a consortium spread
across a hundred planets, making its final ownership impossible to
trace. Those that were traced and contacted had no intention of selling,
no matter how attractive the price. Which showed it couldn't have been a
company behind the purchase--shareholders would gift-wrap their grandmas
if the profit margin was sufficient.

Simultaneously, Artificial Starlight Inc. offered a process similar to
what the Genfurrs themselves were working on…but at a significantly
lower price. Even though the future of their species was at stake, the
Genfurr government still had an eye on long-term economic survival. They
therefore voted to abandon their own research and opted for that offered
by Doctor Yvette Readling.

Yvette ensured the samples shown worked well enough, whilst Samuels
provided all the right words to convince the politicians: both
deliberately bypassing the Genfurr scientists. Yvette's process became
infinitely more attractive as it didn't require another planet-her suns
were manufactured by splitting space itself.

It didn't work outside the lab, but as with all great public works
projects, the government didn't like to be seen as having made a wrong
decision and so kept pouring resources into it in the vague hope that,
once completed, everyone would forget how over-budget and behind
deadlines it had become.

Nothing could be guaranteed to foul up solid business practices more
readily than the business of government.

<img src = "frosterisk.jpg" height=10>

"Oh!" Dee said as she recognised the man at the bar.
Samuels turned and
she was relieved to see he had aged in the years since they'd last
spoken.

"Dee. Long time no see."

"Quite. You're here for the conference then? Translator or insulter?"

"I gave up the political trail. Surprised?"

"Not really." But actually she was: she'd thought Samuels would excel in
the political field. She wondered if it had ended because he couldn't
give allegiance to any specific cause or his own contrary nature meant
he forgot what he was pretending to protect on any given day.

"I saw Yvette a few months ago. She's retired." Dee remembered how she'd
once, ever so briefly, considered working with the doctor. That was
before everything they'd decided to do to the Genfurrs and Yvette's
involvement with the sting.

"You're still a translator?" 

"Reporter. Do you know the Kayhops' speech produces such sharp sonic
booms it can kill an unprotected listener?" 

Samuels nodded, his head seeming too heavy for his neck. 

"Talk about	sharp tongues," Dee said, "Words can	really hurt
you--isn't that
what they say?"

"Only if the wrong person's listening," Samuels said, staring out a
window to avoid looking at the delegates.

[*BLURB] "... I Have Only Slipped Away Into The Next Room"
<small><b>Henry

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>In the calm of the morning, Anna quietly
watched her husband as he sat at the kitchen table reading the newsfeed
on his tablet, a cup of steaming coffee in front of him.  She loved how
his face switched between disparate expressions from one story to the
next, one minute smiling, the next minute frowning, then taut and ready
to lash out at the first person who would dare to speak to him.

She continued to watch him as she cleaned up after breakfast.  He moved
to the living room and sat in his favorite easy chair near the
fireplace. It was a cold morning.  A small fire simmered in the
fireplace, casting out a warm glow and small puffs of dancing sparks.
											 
Later, her neighbor Kathy stopped by with a casserole. Anna thanked her
and invited her for tea. "Thank you.  It's nice to see you smiling
again, Anna."

They sat at the kitchen table.  Most of the time, Anna's
attention was
drawn to her husband in the living room, relaxing in his easy chair with
an ebook reader.  He looked quite comfortable in his blue and gray
jogging clothes,  gray slippers and blue quilted cap.  A few wisps of
gray hair peeked out from under the cap.

"Isn't my husband handsome?"
said Anna. "On his days off, he always
enjoyed reading a good book.  He especially liked mysteries and spy
thrillers."

Kathy's eyes misted.  She nodded and smiled.

"Or he would take me
somewhere pleasant, like the park or some cultural
event in the city.  It wasn't always like this, sitting quietly at home.
He would take me out sometimes."

"I'm sure he would, Anna."

"But I enjoyed our quiet times at home together. Those were always
nice."

"Life can be too hectic.  We all need our quiet times."

"I'm so glad I spent the insurance money on a remembrance hologram
instead of a funeral.  Don't you agree?  Remembering is so much easier
this way."

Kathy stood up.  "Well, I must be going.  Things to do, you know."

Anna nodded. "We always enjoyed our quiet times.  Those were our
favorite times."

Kathy closed the door gently behind her.

[*BLURB] A Lesson in Business Ethics
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">If this was no country for old men then
Sinclair Precinct made for an acceptable retirement home. It was
considered neutral territory by the surrounding gang-bangers, a kind of
turf-war Switzerland. Or, to put it another way, the 'Sin' was a place
where you could get a decent cup of coffee without a side-order of
gunfire.

I was a middle-aged middle-man, a street hustler with a reputation for
having access to esoteric hardware. Everyone knew me; older than God but
not so forgiving - and that would be Old Testament, not New. Every so
often I had to chastise some young pup who tried to muscle in on my
niche supply-chain, but I didn't make a big production out of it.

That morning I was sitting at a table outside Roman's Bar & Grill, on
the corner of 6th and 23rd, nursing an espresso and a hangover. A young
woman approached through the crowd. She looked like a typical corporate
executive, but this place was so outside their comfort zone I had to do
a rethink. A high-end escort, maybe, still dressed to blend in at a
social function held yesterday evening.

She stopped in front of my table. "Mister Wage?"

Everyone gets it wrong the first time so I wasn't too put out. "It's
'Wages, just Wages."

"I apologise, Wages. My name is Rebecca. May I join you?"

I gestured to the chair opposite. "Be my guest. We're just two people
talking." Rebecca sat down, pretty much the poster-girl for 'pert', if
that's what you're into. I was wearing retro wraparound shades
incorporating 4-x zoom micro-cameras and close-up her human likeness
started to fade. She was a medium-grade synthetic - no skin pores - and
natural sunlight wasn't doing her any favours. I sipped my espresso.
"So?"

She placed an acoustic muffler on the table between us and the
surrounding hustle and bustle dropped to a background murmur. "I wish to
obtain a Vygotsky, and quickly."

"Well, maybe, but that's right up there with erotic asphyxiation in
terms of dangerous. Does your prospective client know what they're
letting themselves in for?"  A 'Vygotsky' suppressed the higher brain
functions, letting raw, animal passions come to the fore - basically a
form of induced neural Viagra.

"He would benefit from a little lift, if that's what you mean, but is
touchy about his supposed prowess."

Sure, I got the picture; she wanted him to feel like a 'real man' in the
grip of unbridled lust - but without realising he'd been juiced-up. The
boost to his ego would guarantee repeat business, especially if Rebecca
went for the 'all you needed was the right woman' angle. My fingernails
tapped out an irregular rhythm on the porcelain cup while I thought it
over. "Fifteen-hundred. Half now, half in an hour when I deliver."

Rebecca arched an eyebrow. "That's almost double its retail value."

"The retail value of a regular blank-box, designed simply to suppress
empathic abilities. What I'm offering goes that extra mile and is
illegal pretty much everywhere. I'm not talking about some off-the-shelf
piece of kit tweaked by an electronics student to make a few extra
bucks.  I'm talking about a real Chiba City special, with selective ego
and superego manipulation. But if you don't like the price, feel free to
go elsewhere."

She regarded me coolly for a moment - then nodded. "I understand you don't haggle?"

I shrugged. "Life's too short. I set a price based on availability,
timescale and what I think the market will bear. Seven-fifty up front
and we've got a deal.  If you know I don't haggle then you'll also know
I never, <i>ever</i>, stiff a buyer over delivery."

My new client lifted a credit chip from her purse and held it out. I
touched my own against it. There was a momentary pause as our electronic
agents found a form of mutually acceptable encryption and checked each
other for the usual signs of bad faith. Satisfied, the sum was
transferred to an account in Kurdistan - the acknowledgement projected
onto the inside of my shades as a poor-man's head-up display.

I smiled and sat back in my chair. "One hour."

Rebecca inclined her head by way of acknowledgement, retrieved her
muffler, and walked away. I sensed rather than saw movement in the crowd
- discreet security closing in around her.  I scratched my nose,
bringing the old-school cufflink microphone up close. "Mike, what you
got?"

The sniper in the Italianate bell tower sounded pensive. <i>"Three-man
team
in the crowd, another out in the street alongside a pickup."</i>

"A pickup doesn't sound very corporate."

<i>"Oh, not even close. These guys are street, and not the usual
suspects
either.  Remington Blues, and they must have cojones the size of
basketballs to just waltz in here, showing their colours. Either that or
they've paid our local bangers for the privilege."</i>

I grunted. "Cold hard cash has a way of soothing injured pride, so I'd
go with the pay-off angle. OK, I'll be back in forty minutes." I
hesitated. "Look, Michael, if this team gets trigger-happy second time
around, are you sure you can nail them? Only, a face-full of buckshot
would seriously spoil my day."

He laughed. <i>"Would you rather I got all Medieval on their ass and
came
down there with a sword? Yeah, I can pop all three if their fingers so
much as twitch. You want I should do the girl as well?"</i>

I finished my coffee and stood up.  "No. She's just a pro, a skin-job
with connections."

<i>"You're all heart, my man, all heart."</i>

There was an edge to this deal that I didn't like, but couldn't live
without. I needed the danger more and more as the years went by, like it
was some kind of drug I was becoming inured to. Certainly it stopped me
succumbing to ennui, but ultimately the street was just one long game of
Russian roulette and eventually Lady Luck would call time.

I went inside to make some calls.

<p class=drop>Rebecca was sitting at my table when I returned forty-two
minutes later.
I wasn't altogether comfortable with that, as I'd hoped to tag their
arrival via local CCTV. Still, I managed a smile as I placed a
gift-wrapped box in front of her and sat down. "One customised Vygotsky
mind-fuck. It's assembled from components lacking serial numbers and the
casing incorporates trace-contact neutralisation, so it could be handled
without gloves."

In return she placed a bulky envelope beside the box. "Fifteen-hundred
in small bills. You'll find the previous transaction has been rescinded
and the account I used never existed."

My smile became a little forced. "Cash? How quaint. Not many I deal with
have the juice to screw with the banking system, particularly not my
banking system. I'd be impressed if I wasn't just a tad pissed-off."

She stood and lifted the box. "You'll get over it. As long as I've got
what I want we'll never meet again. Enjoy the rest of your day, Wages."

I watched her go and, no, I wasn't happy. The rest of my day had a sour
taste to it, like a memory of past misdeeds.

<p class=drop>Next morning I sat my usual
table waiting for Greasy McCulloch to show
his face. The slimy little rat-bastard had promised me a line on some
endorphin analogue but failed to make good, meaning I'd had to go
commercial to satisfy my client - and at the agreed price. My mood
wasn't improved any by an article in the eSheet; Frank Vaughn, head of
corporate security over at Anderson Industries, had been arrested on a
charge of manslaughter. He'd bitten the throat out of a flesh-and-blood
prostitute, only escaping a murder beef due to the presence of 'an
illegal neural suppressor, recovered at the scene.' Investigations were
continuing.

Someone like Vaughn didn't get to the top without knowing where the
corporate bodies were buried - both metaphorically and physically. This
was going to give some prominent citizens sleepless nights in case he
cut a deal with the law. The whole thing smacked of the opening salvo in
a move against Anderson Industries, whose share price had already dipped
twenty-seven points.

I signalled for another coffee, left my reader on the table, and went
inside to use the restroom. On the way I coughed twice into my hand, and
then a third time - signalling Mike it was time to make tracks. I don't
believe in coincidence and the hardware I'd provided could only have
come from a limited number of suppliers, with my name third or fourth on
the list. The cops might not put in the overtime trying to trace the
Vygotsky, but corporate security would definitely want to know who was
busting their balls.

Once in the restroom I removed an entire wall panel using two hooks kept
on top of the door frame. Behind lay a short alcove - and a hatch giving
access to the Transit Authority maintenance tunnels. The restroom was
shoehorned in between two industrial freezers used by Sushi Express,
which would screw with anyone using thermal imaging to track me. Madam
Toba's House of Dance, directly above, completed the surveillance
blackout. By the time anyone discovered my escape route I'd have jumped
the Metro and be long gone.

As I reached for the 'going away bag' I kept stashed there - change of
clothes, spending money, a new id - I heard a gunshot from my shades'
built-in speakers. A shotgun blast, not a high-powered rifle. I froze,
my hand on the carry handle. There were indistinct noises then the sound
of something heavy hitting the ground.

<i>"Está muerto."</i> A man's voice; not one I recognised.

I could have ignored it. I could have picked up my bag and vanished into
the maze of tunnels. But I'd known Michael a long, long time - almost
longer than I'd known myself - and that had to count for something. At
the bottom of my bag lay an antique Nagant revolver; an anachronism, but
a reliable one.

I lifted the gun and left everything else behind.

Back in the main dining area several of the patrons were surreptitiously
watching events out in the Precinct. When it registered that I was armed
everyone found something else to occupy their attention. Even Roman, who
kept a sawn-off behind the counter, looked the other way. Everyone knew
I didn't carry a gun. Everyone knew I always left the violence to
others.

That was my edge.

I walked out into the street, immediately spotting three members of the
Remington Blues; one kneeling by Mike's body at the base of the bell
tower, another half-watching the diner, a third emerging from the
stairwell. All three carried pump-action shotguns.

I shot all three in as much time as it takes to tell.

The street crowd gave me room as I walked over and knelt down beside my
friend. Michael lay on his back, unseeing eyes staring at Heaven. He'd
been shot in the back at close range and a spreading fan of blood
resembled nothing more than a pair of wings - completing the image of
him as an angel, fallen to Earth.

One of the Blues lying beside me burbled. I shot him in the face,
feeling the spray of blood and brain matter against my skin. A ripple of
horrified fascination ran through the onlookers.
"Herr Wage, so thoughtful of you not to run. A pursuit in this climate
would be most tedious, no?"

I closed Mike's eyes and stood up, shoulders hunched, turning towards
the voice. The Nagant slid from my fingers and clattered to the ground -
it was of no further use to me. Three men in business suits stood across
the street, with the crowd giving them a clear field of fire. Two were
just muscle in anti-flash contact lenses and double ear pieces, carrying
Steyr assault rifles that looked more like abstract works of art. The
third was small, neat and precise - the same way as an ice-pick through
the eye is precise.

His smile was a thin line. "You are, as they say, the proverbial loose
end. Some…" he gestured towards the fallen gang-bangers, "…are
interested only in pinching it off. I, however, wish to pull it and see
what unravels. I trust there will be no further need for violence?"

I shook my head, more sorrowful than angry. "Violence? You people have
no idea what 'violence' really means. I've spent years, <i>decades</i>,
avoiding this moment, dreading it." I straightened up and tore off my
shades. I heard a woman gasp but most of the onlookers couldn't see my
eyes. "Don't you get it? Doesn't <i>anyone</i> understand?"

Behind me the church bell began to toll. 

My wings blossomed. 

Not white, like Michael's would have been, but black, tinged with
crimson. The crowd shrank back, on the verge of flight, but it was
<i>way</i>
too late for that. My voice rang out around the Precinct.

"The wages of sin…"

I burst into flame.

"…is Death."

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"There. That should do it." Amer Preston
rocked back on his haunches and
resisted the urge to cross his fingers.


"He's not moving." Mrs Ushula's voice grated in a way that set his
teeth on edge.

"No. Well, I haven't rebooted him yet."

"Then do it. Quickly. That's what I'm paying you for." <i>No. That's
what
the Company pays me for.</i> "And he'd better be as good as new. That's
what
they promised in the <i>Petbots</i> service agreement. I know my rights:
'As.
Good. As. New.'"

"Nevertheless, madam, you might want to take it a little easy for the
first couple of weeks after rebooting…"

"Don't tell me how to treat my Dorg. Just do your damn job."
It was as if the words were all just the same jagged sound.

<i>Screech screech screech screech screech screech screech screech.
Screech
screech screech screech screech.</i>

Amer chewed down on a mouthful of expletives. It'd been a long day. He
twisted the Dorg's internal dial as far as it would go and pushed in the
reset button. The Dorg trembled, its eyes rolled down to look front, its
jaws unlocked and its tail quivered erect. It yawned.

"Okay." The Dorg shook itself as if from a long nap and rose to its
feet. Amer held the clipboard towards Mrs Ushula. "If you'd just sign
here."

"I'm not signing anything. I don't need to sign anything. This was all
under the guarantee."

"It's merely to say the work's been done."

"Yes, but <i>has</i> it? I don't want you running away and my Dorg
breaking
down again the moment you're round the corner. I had to wait for two
days for you to come out this time."

"It's merely to say I've been here. And, as you can see, to confirm that
your Dorg is working again. That's all it says."

"Yes. But for how long, eh?"

"Treated properly, this Dorg should last you a lifetime."

"So now it's <i>my</i> fault? That I don't know how to treat a Dorg?
That's
what you're saying, is it?"

A low growl from the Dorg.
Amer knew its lips would be pulled back, the teeth on show. He wasn't
concerned. Dorg's weren't programmed to bite.

<i>Fine. Don't sign. And I hope your Dorg blows up on you. In fact, I
wish
I'd set the thing to burn out and give you a home-delivered
cremation.</i>

Mrs Ushula was enjoying the brief power she held over another human
being, knowing he had to endure her screeching, accusing, insulting, and
couldn't leave her apartment until she'd signed the work docket. Which
she would. Eventually. Because customers like Mrs Ushula were only
powerful before non-entities like himself. Any sign of real authority
and they deflated into obsequious, sliming, syruping slugs.
Schlugs, he thought, renaming it in Petbot style. The ideal gift for the
petty bureaucrat in your life.

<p class=drop>I've lived alone since mother died and so I got him for
company. But
now, the poor thing…"

"Well, we've performed a remote-diagnosis, sir, and there doesn't seem
anything the matter with his electrics. The Kitt is quite a hardy,
independent model. If it's reliable company you're after, perhaps you'd
be better off with a Dorg?"

"No. No. Mother always had cats when she was a child. She told me all
about them when I was growing up, but I had my allergies. That's why I
chose to have a Kitt."

"Well, Mr Davin, I suggest we reload his initial programming and then
reboot him. That will start him afresh and we'll see if that sorts the
fella out."

"Yes. Yes. I wouldn't want to actually <i>replace</i> him, you see?"

"No. Quite. We understand. People get very attached to their own
Petbot-that's why we make them all individual-looking. Unique."

"Mister Terence is very handsome."

"Yes. Yes, he's a fine model. Well, let's go with that then, shall we
-see if it sorts itself out?"

"He'll be the same, though, won't he?"

"The same but better, I assure you."

<p class=drop>On the drive home, Amer pictured the syruping shlug. A
little imagination went a long
way. Sometimes…,<i>too far</i>.

There was an inconvenient law of physics concerning the inability to
destroy energy. That it just got passed on: endlessly, never lessening.
The same, he acknowledged, went for negative energy. First step, then,
was to offload the bundle that Mrs Ushula had dumped on him.

He swung by <i>BotBox</i> and took a low-rated Bot for five rounds in
which he
pummelled it mercilessly, even using a stool to break its casing, until
its wires were exposed. When he left, Mary raised an eyebrow.

"Tough day?"

"When isn't it?"

"You go that far again, Am, and the boss says I gotta charge you extra.
You know they can't take that kind of punishment. We can't re-inflate
that one-it'll need an entire recovering."

"Sorry." Mary shrugged pulled up a smile. "Ahh, forget it. Boss is on my
tail. His Boid is playing up. Always puts him in a foul mood."

"Tell me about it," Amer said, thinking of Mrs Ushula and undoing much
of the good that venting on the Bot had done him.

<p class=drop>"C'mon, Mister Terence. C'mon and sit on my lap. Please?"

Mister Terence let out a pitiful mewl. The voice was programmed to sound
sweet and kitten-like, but to Richard's ears Terence was in agony.
Richard's fingers itched and twitched their way towards the
<i>Petbots</i>
emergency line. The fast dial was rated number two on his phone.

Right after his own doctor's.

It was Mister Terence's wiring again. Poor thing. He was wired too
tight, so that his nerve endings were as sensitive as thin, white-hot
pins. Every step he took was torture, every movement ground his joints
so their metal surfaces grated into a fine, metallic dust.

Richard gasped, doubled over, and swept Mister Terence up into his arms
to nurse him as only he knew how. The rebooting had done nothing-Richard
could have told them that. That it was something serious.
<i>Serious</i>.

To them, Mister Terence was just another Petbot.

Mister Terence was special. Delicate. A sickly, needful thing that only
Richard understood.

Richard hit number two.

<p class=drop>"Amer. Come in."

"What's this about?"

"As I said on the phone: Mrs Hilda Ushula. And her Dorg."

Amer felt sick. Felt like quitting there and then. During the drive into
work this morning, he'd felt himself alternate between seething
indignation at the way he was treated by customers and sick dread at the
coming confrontation.

Now he saw it was something even worse: his supervisor, Trisha, had been
joined by someone he didn't recognise. Someone dressed in a suit rather
than overalls, which never boded well. No frayed cuffs, no tell-tale
bulge of odds-and-ends that mechanics hid about their clothing.

"Amer, this is Martin Links. I've been telling Martin how you're one of
our most experienced, best Bottics. We're both of us hoping you can help
<i>Petbots</i> with something."

"I…" The introduction robbed Amer of the speech he'd been drafting. "Of
course," he managed. "Anything I can do to help."
Martin smiled.

"Then let me ask you something, Amer, and-please-answer me as truthfully
as you can. You needn't worry about anything you say here being
attributed to you, I assure you. In your work as a Bottic, have you
noticed anything <i>strange</i> about the Petbots of some of our
customers?"

"Strange?" Amer frowned, tasting the word. "I'm not sure what you mean.
If anything, it's some of our <i>customers</i> are the strange ones. The
Bots
are just mechanical things."

"Yes. But what about the problems you've found yourself encountering
with certain Petbots? Do they seem, well, to fall into any kind of
pattern?"

"Well, when they go wrong, they do seem to produce a rather worrisome
reaction in our customers," Amer said.

"Worrisome?"

"So, maybe 'neurotic' is closer to the mark."

"Only neurotic reactions?"

"Well, angry customers too. Aggressive. Most of my calls are repeat
problems, so maybe they have reason to be upset."

Trisha was nodding and when she turned to Martin her look said: <i>See,
I told you so.</i>

"Can I ask what this is about?"

"Not just yet, Amer. Let's go back to the case of Mrs Hilda Ushula. What
was the problem with her Dorg?"

"I'm not entirely sure. It just shut down. I had to reboot it."

"Would it surprise you to learn that wasn't the first time Mrs Ushula's
Dorg had abruptly shut down, without explanation?"

Amer exhaled through his nose, and mashed his lips until they turned
white as he remembered the shit he'd had to put up with when he'd
visited her. And all the time there was an inherent fault with the
bloody Dorg she'd been sold! Martin read his irritation and help up his
hands.

"Hey, don't get me wrong. Mrs Ushula is the common factor here. The
Petbot you operated on was a replacement. The second replacement, in
fact, that she's been given. The same issue has arisen on each occasion,
with different models."

Amer jerked in surprise. Dorgs-like Boids and Kitts-were all
tamper-proof. Only Petbot technicians possessed the keys to open them in
order to reboot or make adjustments.

"You think she found a way to get inside them?"
Martin shook his head.

"We considered that. We even had someone examine the Dorgs for signs of
tampering, but there was nothing-nothing at all."

"Three different Dorgs? All with the same problem? That's a hell of a
coincidence. Did they all come from the same batch?"

"Nope. Each different. Each tested before despatch. No complaints from
other owners within the batches. And the two Dorgs she had before have
since been rebooted and even rehoused-and neither shows any problems
now."

"Interference in the residence?"

"Shouldn't affect a Petbot, but we tested anyway. Nothing. Nothing at
all."

"Then what's causing them to shut down?"

The other two were quiet a moment and Martin asked his next question as
if it came with a line sizzling towards a pile of dynamite.

"Amer, what was your impression of Mrs Ushula?"

<p class=drop>"Don't you worry about a thing, Mister Terence," Richard
said as he
rocked the Kitt back and forth, hugging him tightly to his chest. The
ache within his own heart felt like his ribs were closing in upon it so
that very soon it would scrunch up like something made of crisp, brown
paper.
The number was busy. He'd rejected the option of a Botoperator and so
joined the queue for those waiting to speak to a human Bottic. Every
time he was told his call was important and would he mind holding,
Richard let out a plaintive whine that looped back through the receiver
to hitch up his worries.

"Oh, come <i>on</i>! He's dying!"

"</i>You're through to the Petbot Helpline. How can I help you?</i>"

"It's Mister Terence. He's hurting. He's shivering, the poor thing. He's
got some kind of fever, some virus like the computers had in the past.
There's something wrong with him. He's-"

"<i>Okay, sir. Is Mister Terence a Kitt, Boid or Dorg?</i>"

"K-k-kitt."

"<i>And do you have him there with you?</i>"

Richard looked down into the eyes of the trembling, suffering beast,
nodding until the Bottic asked her question again.

"Y-yes, Mister Terrence is here."

"<i>Well, we can start with a downline diagnosis. If you'd like to plug
your net cable into Mister Terence, we can see what the trouble might
be.</i>"

Richard looked over to his own private diagnosis kit.

"I've already done that. It says there's nothing wrong. But this is
something new. Unique. Mister Terence is special. You doctors are all
alike."

There was a pause on the other end. A space into which an embarrassed
cough might have been inserted.

"<i>Do I take it you have a home kit?</i>"

"Yes. I've tried everything. He needs special help. Why do you people
never see that? He's dying…"

<p class=drop>"We have four principal categories of Bots on the market:
Passives,
Programmed-Reactive, Reactive-Bias and Empathetic. Everyone dreams of
creating a totally Independent-Reactive, of course, but that's
impossible."

"But these Petbots are reacting, aren't they?" Amer said.

"No," Martin said. "Don't get me wrong. It might <i>seem</i> that these
Petbots
are taking reactive-independent decisions, but they're not. They're
still strictly Empathetics."

"You just said that Mrs Ushula's Dorg shut itself down. <i>Killed
itself?</i>
Committed suicide?"

Amer still couldn't quite get his head around the concept. Successive
Dorgs under the frightful woman's ownership were not malfunctioning, but
taking the decision to turn themselves off.

"You said yourself what she was like, Amer," Trisha said.

"Yes, and I could understand a husband of hers might have taken his own
life-but a Petbot?"

"Hang on, hang on," Martin said. "We're not talking a Reactive Decision
here, remember?"

"I don't really understand the jargon when it comes to the different
categories," Amer said. "I'm a Bottic. I make them work, I don't have
anything to do with their design."

"Your Passive Bots are like the ones at BotBox-strictly passive
constructs you can manhandle, use like any other non-reactive piece of
machinery. Then there's Reactive Bots: those that respond to the stimuli
or environment about them. Initially, we sold Programmed-Reactives, but
that meant they were pre-programmed with a pre-chosen, set reaction to
specific stimuli. We tried that with our earliest Petbots, but all
owners were different and didn't always want the same reaction as other
customers. So we switched to Reactive Bias, giving a choice of
personality-types specifically tailored to the purchaser's own likes and
dislikes. The problem with that was that, once pre-selected, their very
predictability undermined the Petbot's realism.

"So we went for the old adage that pets grow to be like their owners and
we employed an Empathetic equation. Owners don't want blind obedience,
but sympathetic concurrence. Unconditional love and approval, yes, but a
creature in their own image which shows them that they're truly loved,
liked for what they are. They don't want something so independent it
chooses to run or fly off to a better house round the corner."

"This is all a bit too deep for me," Amer said.

"Okay, okay. But you get the basic differences. The popularity of the
new Petbots is because they mirror or complement their owners, right?"

"But if the Petbot thinks Mrs Ushula is the best thing it's ever smelt
or rubbed up against, why should it go kill itself? That wouldn't be
empathy, that would be a sign of independent decision."
Martin was blushing.

"No. It's because, perhaps, it's empathising a little <i>too</i> well."

<p class=drop>"<i>The diagnosis shows nothing,</i>" the Bottic on the
line told
him.

"But he's not well, I tell you!" Richard rocked Mister Terence in his
arms, feeling the death and disease that was draining Mister Terence's
vitality away suckle cruelly at his heart.

"<i>We'll despatch a Bottic to you as soon as possible, sir. I see by
our
records you have our Platinum coverage?</i>"

"But Mister Terence needs help now!"

"<i>We understand your concern, sir, but the Bottic will be able to help
when he or she arrives. Until then, might we suggest you leave the Kitt
undisturbed so as not to overexert its batteries?</i>"

Richard gave in and began to wail.

<p class=drop>"People wanted pets that reflected their characters, their
personalities. And that's what they're getting. Only, Petbots are
showing what their owners are like behind all the social covering, all
the supposed toughness they might present to the outside world."

"You mean…" <i>That Mrs Ushula is a deeply unhappy, self-loathing
individual who's only real solution to her misery is to take her own
life?</i>

Amer swallowed at the enormity of this revelation. Despite his dislike for the woman, he felt shock-not pity, but a kind of hollowing, draining depression. 

"I mean that Kitts, Dorgs, Boids, can all be just as neurotic,
aggressive, petty or arrogant as their owners. Those same owners are
calling <i>us</i> up to complain that their Petbots are malfunctioning
and that
it's all our fault. When, in fact, the problem is…"

"With themselves. Short of telling them what's happening, what are you
going to do?"

"We were hoping you could tell us," Trisha said. "Research and Marketing
are at a loss and so will the company balance sheet be unless we come up
with something soon."


"There's only so much I can fix with a screwdriver," Amer said,
imagining himself sticking one into Mrs Ushula's head and attempting to
tighten the loose screws within. He remembered what his anger had caused
him to do to the Boxbot. What would a Dorg in his own image end up doing
to itself to be free of who he was?

Amer swallowed. It was one thing to be told, even shown, your life
didn't contain that much to be thrilled by. It was quite another to have
a solution to your worries played out before you.

[*ITEM] Magdalena and the Dragon

[*AUTHOR] Peter Morrison

[*BLURB] There is nothing so restorative as a nice cup of tea.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">“This is really quite strange tea,”
Magdalena offered in another attempt to encourage the dragon to share
the pot. But with the arch of a red, leathery, <i>oh, really?</i>
eyebrow, the dragon declined. “I mean in a good way!”

Magdalena sipped at it delicately in order to illustrate that the
beverage was quite drinkable, even if it tasted just that little bit
odd. As though there was some kind of spice or herb mixed with the
leaf the tea had been brewed from - something unidentifiable, but full
of promise. The dragon shrugged eloquently, puffed smoke into the air.
Well, she had offered, which was the polite thing to do and the dragon
really did seem quite content.

Magdalena had found an advert on the notice board of the University’s
student union. She’d taken one of the tear off strips and the Magician’s
response to her email had included a map to this café. On arrival she’d
been directed to the table with the dragon and encouraged to help
herself to the tea.

They had been sitting at this table outside the café for quite some
time. The dragon wasn’t much of a conversationalist. So far, not one
word had been puffed forth. Rather, she was the recipient of funny
looks. Hugely demonstrative funny looks, to be fair. On every attempted
topic, she was under no illusion as to the dragon’s opinion. But
Magdalena was a young woman who desired action, sitting in silence was
not her style.

Perhaps it would have helped if they had provided a biscuit to go with
the tea? A sweet little nibble of some sort, at the very least, it would
have been common decency. The waitress had apologized, assuring her they
were all out and hadn’t been seen since. Magdalena sighed. The dragon
sighed too. Magdalena drank more tea. The dragon puffed more smoke.

Magdalena made a production of looking at her watch. The dragon was
attentive in her appreciation of the drama. Playing up to the audience
she exaggerated the huffing and sighing: mouthing 2 o’clock and
gesturing at the watch face. It was now coming up for 3 o’clock. But it
made no difference; her expression of epic restlessness did nothing to
conjure forth a magician eager to lead them on an adventure.

Magdalena was starting to feel a bit off - too much tea with nothing to
eat - probably not a good idea. She took a sip anyway, she couldn’t
help herself. She sat back and puffed some smoke. It took a moment but
upon consideration she found this to be a little surprising. She turned
to the woman sitting beside her to express her sense of <i>would you
look at that?</i>

But. Wait a minute. The woman smiled at her. <i>Where did the dragon
go?</i>
She looked at the cup propped on her red scaled hand. <i>Bugger</i>, she
thought, with enthusiasm. But did not say, finding that she had been
rendered incapable of speech.

“Thanks,” the woman smiled. With a nod, she got up and walked away.
Magdalena knew then that the tea had been stranger than it really ought
to have been. She’d been set up - something of an adventure indeed!

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">As a long-time fan and writer of text
adventures, I have rediscovered the	joys of interactive fiction. This
adventure uses the latest, and most feature-filled, adventure creation
engine - Inform 7.

It is a cyberpunk story, and is pitched at Text Adventure Beginner
level.

It is my belief that all the information the reader needs to participate
is contained in the game itself. The important thing is to examine
everything, read everything, inspect what you - the player - are
carrying, and then act accordingly. There's a manual, and there are
hints.
