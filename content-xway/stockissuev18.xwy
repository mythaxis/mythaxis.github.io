[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Outside, it was minus ten Celsius. The sea
was still
frozen. Through the windows behind the Kalastajatorppa Hilton's
reception hall, I could see people walking about on the ice. I could
also see the woman talking to the desk clerk. An American. I can't
distinguish regional accents, but she was well-dressed and sounded as if
she was accustomed to getting her way with hotel staff. She was showing
the man a photograph. He eventually shook his head. She persisted. He
pointed across the foyer at me. My client had already left, and his
chair was still vacant. She came across and sat down without being
invited.

"Can I ask you a question?" she said.

"Please be seated. My name is Juho Virtanen."

"I'm sorry. My name is Margaret Fountain."

"How do you do."

"Have you seen my daughter?" showing me the photograph, "She is called
Rachel. Rachel Fountain."

I recognised the girl, of course, but she hadn't been calling herself
Rachel Fountain. I knew her as Ann Smith, and I'd met her briefly, a
week ago. A plain girl, but not actually ugly. Athletic. A little
underweight. Good teeth, hair and skin.

I said, "I don't remember her. Have you lost her? I may be able to help."

"She left home in Los Angeles two weeks ago. I discovered she'd booked a
flight to Helsinki with one night in this hotel. I only found out
because she used an online booking system that automatically credits the
FrequentFlier miles to my account.  I've been in contact with the
management here, but she only stayed the one night. I just arrived to
try and trace her."

"And you're talking to me because...?" I knew why, but I wanted to know
what she thought.

"Teens only have one reason for coming to Helsinki these days."

"How old is she?"

"Sixteen."

"She's officially an adult here."

"Yes, I know. I'm worried about that. I spoke to the police, but..."

"... But she's not breaking the law in Finland, and she's an adult, so
they can't help," I finished.

"Yes. I'm concerned she'll do something stupid."

"Most of the procedures are pretty costly. There's a limit to what she
could buy."

"That's part of the problem. She was living in my beach house. She
managed to sell it behind my back and I guess she's converted the
proceeds to NetDollars. But still, I'm hoping it's just a cosmetic
procedure she wants."

"Not necessarily. There are a number of possible procedures. She may be
applying to VGMK for a new organ or limb. She may be seeking treatment
from one of the many clinics here that offer gene modification to avoid
inheritable diseases or tendencies. She may desire a body modification -
horns, tails and tusks are popular with the more adventurous young
persons this year. She may wish to donate an ovum or embryo for future
use. She may..."

"OK! I have no clear idea what her intentions are. In my mother's day,
it was tattoos and piercings, in mine, cyber enhancements and implanted
hardware. Now, it's all body and DNA mods.  I'd be prepared to pay for
your time and expenses to find her. The clerk tells me that you are
trustworthy and that you act as a... an agent? for GM procedures. You
have contacts, yes? "

"Yes, I am a field representative for VGMK and a few other independent
companies, but principally in the field of organ and limb replacements."

"VGMK? Who are they?"

"They are the Finnish state gene modification centre. They started this
business a century ago, immediately after they left the EU. Organ banks,
skin and limb farms, tissue matching. Your daughter has no such
deficiencies, I presume."

"Of course not! 

"Of course not. However, I <i>do</i> have a number of contacts in the
cosmetic and body enhancement areas, and I could ask around. Show me the
photo again." She held it out. I copied it to my FlashMem. "And dump me
your contact details, and Rachel's."

"She's ditched her cell, I think. It's been no-sig since she
disappeared. Please help, if you can."

I said: "It occurred to me that Rachel might have an accomplice. Is
there a a boy or girlfriend involved, do you think?"

"I don't think so. The flight and hotel bookings were for a single
traveller. Besides, she's a bit of a loner, never expressed any interest
in boys... or girls, for that matter."

"Hobbies?"

"She runs a lot. Miles along the beach every day, or on nature trails.
And she was a little star-struck for a while. There are various
entertainment stars living in our area. She used to spend hours standing
outside their homes, hoping for a glimpse, and she has a collection of
keepsakes and posters from some of them. But teenage girls go through
that sort of phase. I know I did."

"Anyone in particular? Could one of them be on tour in Finland?"

"Oh! Alex Dostoyevsky - he was flavour of the month for a while. I don't
think it's his real name. Horrid guy, but she adored him."

It was clear this woman's family was well-heeled. California beach
houses have never come cheap. To milk the situation, I'd have to make
this seem more difficult than it looked. I declined an advance. The
price would escalate later.

"I'll be in touch," I said, "You'll be staying here?"

"Yes. Room 788. Do your best, please."

As I left the hotel, I heard the ice give one of its characteristic
eerie groans, and in the early twilight, a  fox ran through the taxi
rank and tiptoed up the rocks into the pines.

<p class=drop>He was
known as Zeb. Short for Zebra, not Zebedee. His particular mutation was
zebra stripes. All over him. Including his face. I caught up with him in
a steamed-up coffee shop by the harbour, talking to a mermaid. Mermaids
are one of VGMK's less successful ideas. Apart from anything else,
merpeople are fat and ugly, because of all the blubber. They smell...
kind of fishy. And they have immensely powerful shoulders and arms to
drag themselves around on land, like seals. Short, kinky black hair, not
blonde. Grey, dolphin-like skin all over, not pink above and scaly below
as seen in popular art. Unattractive. She eventually flopped and
slithered out.

I said: "Hi, Zeb. Your new girlfriend?"

"Ach... She's OK. They're great underwater workers, and sub-sea farming
is important these days. Coffee?

"No, thanks. Look, I'll come to the point. You remember that girl, Ann
Smith, that I sent to you?"

"What? You looking for a cut on the commission?"

"Well, maybe. But there's more money to be made for both of us if you
haven't placed her yet."

"You must think I'm some miracle worker," he said. "There's waiting
lists all over. I've got her stashed in the New Hesperia while I sort
something out."

"Great. The thing is - her Mum's over from the States looking for her. I
think we could share in a big finder's fee, and the longer it takes, the
bigger the fee will be."

"I don't know. I'd lose the commission on the procedures."

"Not necessarily. You could get her done and pick up your percentage
before we 'find' her."

A grin crinkled his striped cheeks as he took that in. "It's a deal."

"Just one thing. You'd better move her out of the New Hesperia to
somewhere obscure, way out of town. I wouldn't put it past Mummy to
visit every decent hotel in the city with her photograph."

"Yeah, right. I've got that cottage in the woods up country, with a
couple of caretakers. She'd like that." We all knew that Zeb was
desperately rich, and suspected that Zeb's "cottage" was a luxurious,
under-used mansion. She should be very safe there.

"Just make sure she doesn't connect <I>me</I> with this deal, so I can
look like a hero when I find her. We're not doing anything illegal, but
it wouldn't look good. By the way, what does she want?"

"The girl? No biggy. Parthenogenesis job."

"Virgin birth?"

"Right. With a little twist. Nothing tricky or weird, though."

"What sort of a 'twist', Zeb?" 

"She's got some DNA off some disgusting popstar all the kids are are
crazy about. She provoked him into spitting at her and she preserved it
in a sterile container. She wants to have his babies, plural."

"No	accounting for taste, eh? Who are you placing it with?"

"Well, I was expecting to use KOGM - they have the shortest waiting
list, but if she wants the best, I guess she'll have to wait for Niemi's
clinic. Could be three weeks"

"Suits us."

"Yes it does, doesn't it."

<p class=drop>Next day, I called Ms. Fountain to report that I was
making progress, but I'd know more the following day, Wednesday.

On Wednesday, as soon as Zeb reported he'd moved Rachel, I called Ms.
Fountain and arranged to meet. I'd decided to tell her about Rachel's
stay at the New Hesperia before she found out for herself. It would
establish confidence.

I found Margaret Fountain in the bar of her hotel, staring out the
window. Just outside, on the open-air beachfront terrace, in a
temperature of minus ten degrees Celsius, three Polars were sitting
around a metal table drinking. Already carrying a thick layer of fat
against the cold, they were made bulkier by their heavy natural fleece.
Drinking vodka, of course. Beer would have frozen in the can. Every so
often, one of them hammered on the heavy triple-glazed door with an
empty vodka bottle, and a waiter would be dispatched with a replacement,
going round the long way so as not to let the winter into the lounge
bar. Margaret Fountain seemed fascinated by them.

"I don't want her ending up like that," she said, shuddering.

"No danger, Ms Fountain. They were developed over years, at great
expense. You seldom see them indoors, and never in Helsinki except in
wintertime. They find warmth very unpleasant."

"Are they... human?"

 "Oh, yes. A race apart, but they can theoretically interbreed with the
 rest of us, though both sexes only have a short period of fertility,
 just in the summer, when they moult their winter coats. They were
 created from a group of Lapp volunteers by VGMK to work in sub-zero
 conditions. So now the Arctic permafrost is warmed and softened by
 genetically modified bacteria, and Finland grows genetically modified
 cereals in the Arctic tundra, tended by genetically modified men who
 look more like bears than people. And their females? Hard to
 distinguish. Rough folk."

Polars typically wore only enough clothing for modesty. The three
outside were dressed in shorts and trainers, only their leathery faces
emerging from a thick white pelt that enveloped them from head to toe.

She drew herself together with a visible effort. "You have some news for
me?" she said.

"Yes. She's been staying at the New Hesperia under the name of Ann
Smith, but she left yesterday evening. I think she may have been tipped
off by my enquiries. However, I've got a line on the agent she's using,
so I'm hopeful. You mentioned an advance yesterday. I could do with a
little money for expenses now. A few thousand dollars would do,
meantime. There's a lot of secrecy in the industry, and breaking into it
costs. I may also have to travel."

"Certainly. I'm grateful for your assistance. Will ten K do?"

"Fine." I gave her my pay-in code, and she PPed the sum on the spot.

<p class=drop>Over the next week, I relieved Ms Fountain of another
thirty K, drip-feeding my story of an energetic hunt for Rachel. I was
able to reassure her that Rachel was still waiting for treatment, but I
pretended not to know <i>where</i> she was waiting. I split the funds
with Zeb, seventy percent for me, thirty for him. It was only fair. I
was doing most of the work.

Meanwhile, I was negotiating on behalf of a prominent Middle Eastern
client for a kidney transplant. Most First World countries were relaxed
about medical applications of GM, and most had their own facilities. But
many African and Asian nations had religious or ethical objections to
spare parts surgery. I was there to ensure wealthy citizens of these
nations that VGMK was their friend, no names, no disclosure. VGMK's
successful Unconscious Universal Donor operation supplied the entire
globe with organ and limb transplants, and the few mistakes they had
made seemed to have been forgiven.

I entertained my client at a folkloric 'puppet' show, unique in the
world. On the stage, Ilmarinen was being tricked by
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen to travel to Pohjola, where he would create
the Sampo. It was a tale unfamiliar to most, and only comprehensible to
me because I'd read snippets from Finland's folk tales - the Kalevala.
The drama was being enacted by 'Little People', one of VGMK's misguided
experiments.

The original intention had been to develop a race of tiny 'human-like'
people, that could be a charming animated doll or pet for children. The
creature was called Menninkäinen - gnome. They had turned out to be all
too human in their disposition: aggressive, thieving, sexually active,
and the experiment had been abandoned, all Little People to be rounded
up and killed. Due to public anthropomorphic sentiment for their plight,
the killing was incompletely carried out, and quite a few remained in
captivity. A number. it was rumoured, had escaped and formed colonies in
the wild. They were based on a strain of monkeys whose DNA is very
similar to humans, but incorporated quite a lot of human genes, so that
they really resembled small humans with oversized heads. They could not
speak, so the soundtrack was spoken by the theatre. They were
well-trained, being about as clever as dogs. They reproduced very
quickly, copiously, and indiscriminately, about one year a generation.
Uncontrolled, they could have produced a population explosion.

My client was clearly impressed by the show. The precision and grace of
the creatures' movements, the dramatic appearance of the characters, the
excellence of the costumes. His obvious delight improved my own
enjoyment. The language was Finnish, but the rhythmic epic poetry had
its mysterious appeal, and there were supertitles in English.

After the performance, however, Zeb's Giant, Matti, was waiting for me
in the foyer, stooping to avoid clashing with the light fittings. A
slightly more successful VGMK development, Giants filled many niches in
society for which height was an asset, but it was common to see these
three-metre Giants squeezed into public transport or doubled over in
shops. Matti said: "Zeb wants you to come with me now."

Zeb could have txted a message. Matti was obviously there to make sure I
actually came. He knew I could have been dragged along like an reluctant
child. My client was impressed all over again by Matti. He wasn't keen
to be sent back to his hotel, but I promised to entertain him again very
soon. Meanwhile, he had other sightseeing to do.

Zeb was waiting around the corner in a  Lexus Hummer lookalike, but
bigger. The engine was running, the heater on. Matti folded himself into
the space where the backseats and luggage area were combined. I opened
the kerbside door to talk to Zeb, who was in the driving seat. "Get in!"
he said.

I got into the passenger seat because it would have been too cold to
stand in the street and argue.

"What is it?"

"We've got trouble. Big trouble, and it's all your fault. Your girl has
disappeared." He was driving towards the Kotka road.

"<i>My</i> girl?"

"Ann Smith, so called."

"OK, so she's changed her mind. They sometimes do. Especially the
teenagers. It's not a complete loss, Zeb. You lose your commission, but
we took a packet from Mummy already."

"You don't understand. She's missing. She went out for a walk and never
came back."

"In this temperature?"

"Yeah, well, she'd been out before, well wrapped up, and came back OK.
It's nice out there. It's near Repovesi."

"That's a wilderness, Zeb! Is that where your m&ouml;kki is?"

"Sure. There's other cottages like it in the area, she may turn up. And
the staff are out looking for her."

"Why am I in this car with you?"

"Because you are equally responsible. We are going to look for this girl
together, and we are not calling the emergency services, and we will
never speak of this to anyone but each other."

"OK. I'll help, but we've got to go a little public to speak to the
neighbours, so word will get out. There's no harm in telling the truth.
She was at your place perfectly legitimately, awaiting her treatment. It
was a kindness. We needn't mention the Ms. Fountain connection."

"I suppose so."

It was nearly three hours before we got to Zeb's cottage, late at night.
To my surprise, it really was a a cottage, not a country house as I'd
expected. After we left the main road, we only saw one other habitation,
then we took the side road, then the rough track. The cottage had a main
room and two bedrooms. The staff consisted of an elderly Russian couple
who lived in one of the bedrooms. That was it. Every few weeks, someone
from a nearby town drove up there with essential supplies - food,
cooking gas, bottled water, a can of diesel for the generator. It was
life as it was probably lived two hundred years ago.

Ann had not returned. The old couple, refugees from just over the border
in Russia, spoke little Finnish. But they did speak reasonable English.
Apparently, the girl used to out and walk close to the cottage, wearing
a borrowed fur coat and boots. She seemed to enjoy it. She had always
returned after an hour or so. Today, she hadn't. And her cellphone was
right here.

Despite the late hour, we phoned every neighbour - there weren't many -
just half a dozen in a ten kilometer radius. Only two were occupied, and
they knew nothing. We called the police. If she hadn't been found by
now, we could be fairly sure she was dead.

As soon as it was light, Zeb and I explored the immediate area around
the cottage, searching, calling. Trees, snowdrifts, fallen branches.
There were some fearsome steep slopes and even cliffs, frozen waterfalls
and streams, but no sign of her. Not a footprint. It had snowed. It was
easy to get lost. Without Zeb, I'd have never found my way back to the
cottage, even with my GPS. You couldn't see the cottage even when you
were quite close.

Meanwhile, the police had visited all the unoccupied properties in the
area, and drawn a blank. They spent a day with dogs. The dogs ran in
circles, barked, tugged at their leads, sat, wagged tails, and generally
did what dogs do when there's no scent. From experience, the police knew
that a search helicopter, even with IR capability, was useless in such a
heavily wooded area. They clearly expected someone to stumble over some
bones in the Spring. The Russian wife complained that Ann had taken her
coat and boots, so she could not venture out any more. I gave her money
for replacements and arranged for the delivery van to bring them.

Then we went back to Helsinki. I had bad news to deliver.

<p class=drop>I told Margaret Fountain that her daughter had probably
suffered a misadventure during a forest walk while awaiting her
procedure. She insisted she would stay and await news, however hopeless.
Though it was hardly my fault that the girl had screwed up, I was
suffering from guilt, big time, and I tried to return Mrs Fountain's
money. When she refused, I insisted she move out of the expensive hotel,
and live in my spare room. We telephoned the police every day without
success.

For most of my time in Helsinki, I had been living alone in a small
rented house in Munkkiniemi on the shore of a lagoon, a short distance
from the centre of my operations, the Kalastajatorppa Hilton. The sea
view from the triple-glazed picture window of my workroom included the
frozen bay, distant headlands, huge rocks and stunted trees and bushes,
the lagoon now frozen into a white moonscape, the floes piled against
and riding over each other in confusion. The serenity and the long eerie
creaking and clanking of the ice seemed to soothe her.

At first, she reminisced about her lost daughter, her separated husband,
her rich, but ruined, life. Listening to her, it just made me feel
worse, and I selfishly wanted her gone.

To my surprise, she stayed on from the short, stark, severe days of late
winter through balmy early summer with long days and nights, when it
never became properly dark, evening fading into morning, the lagoon
peppered with pleasure craft. She spoke less, busied herself around the
house, then, suddenly, she decided to go.

That should heve been the tragic end of it all.

<p class=drop>This morning, as I left the house on the way to the hotel,
a fox, possibly the vixen whose brood had been making the Spring nights
loud with delighted yelps, was sitting on a rock opposite my gate. She
stared boldly at me for a minute, meeting my eyes, and then
slid easily into the trees.

Mikko, the desk clerk, called across as I entered the lobby: "Juho, I
have a letter for you."

"A letter? People don't <i>write</i> to me, or to anyone, these days. It
must be a contract or a court summons or something else legal."

"Nope. A letter." And so it was. In a red, white and blue striped
envelope, with actual stamps, a modern antique from the US Mail.

Dear Juho,

This is to tell you the great news that Rachel has been returned to me,
intact. I should already have told you, but I have been so excited. She
arrived last month carrying a temporary passport issued in Norway. She
has had the most the most amazing adventures, and I enclose a cutting
from our neighbourhood 'newspaper'. I am most grateful for your kindness
in Helsinki, and I am relieved to tell you that she has given up her
desire to mother the spawn of the Devil!

Please stay in touch.

Warm Regards.

Margaret.

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark

[*BLURB]  Oh, wherefore art thou, Damocles?

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"How is she? Any change?" Pygar walked
across the bedchamber to stand by my shoulder. He sounded genuinely
concerned for the young woman lying fully-clothed on the divan before
us, as if our overall situation meant nothing.

However, I managed to produce my usual sardonic grin. "Well, if she dies
I'm sure we'll be the first to know."

He glared at me. "Must you always be so flippant?"

I shrugged. "It's just the way I'm made. Incidentally, Library has
reported a new access event. The information obtained is in the special
annex, if you ever bothered to look."

"And does it impact directly upon our plight?"

"No, not exactly."

"Then why bother to mention it?"

"Well, apparently I'm based on an actor called Clark Gable."

Pygar frowned. "An actor? Some music-hall swell?"

"Close enough. Whereas <i>you</i>, my fine semi-feathered friend…" I
slapped his muscular shoulder,"…are from a tale entitled 'Barbarella'."

His wings quivered in obvious irritation. "A story-book character? What
nonsense - angels <i>exist</i>, of that I am certain."

I gestured to my horns. "And what of devils?"

Before he could reply a Servitor entered the bedroom; an androgynous
young woman clad in the simple grey dress of her calling. She approached
us and dropped to one knee, head bowed. "My Lords Arbiter,  Constable
Fain requests your presence to rule in a dispute."

Day-to-day civic strife held no appeal for me. "You attend, Pygar. You
always see the best in people."

He smiled, somewhat ruefully. "And yet I fear it is you who truly
appreciates the human condition. What was it you said last week - 'a
plague on both your houses'? Most apt, as it transpired."

"Still, walk amongst the populace, they find your presence
heart-warming.
Me they merely fear."

The angel inclined his head by way of acknowledgement. He left with the
Servitor following a deferential three paces behind.

I made a mental note to watch my turn of phrase, but this new
'Shakespeare' I'd been reading seemed to worm his way into one's very
substance. Library could not regulate the information acquired during
these ever more frequent contacts with an entire <i>universe</i> somehow
separated from our own - and the more I learned the less certain I
became of our world and my place in it.

Alone, I turned to glare at the sleeping form of Aurelia Havisham.
Although resting for a few days at a time was commonplace it was now
five weeks since last she stirred. Aurelia was the axis around which the
great city-state of Haven revolved; a benevolent mistress, immortal and
ageless. Pygar and I were her stewards, her conscience, her dispensers
of justice. The world may change but we did not.

And it was all a fraud. 

"Library!"

<i>Yes, Gable, I am here.</i>

"Have you been able to learn anything more concerning Aurelia? Anything
at all?"

<i>Unfortunately nothing beyond the original reference to 'biomorphic
dissonance'. However I have determined that the technology of our world
is classified as 'late Victorian', and while the significance of that
epithet escapes me, in context I would seem to be an obvious
anachronism.</i>

I frowned. "Meaning?"

<i>Meaning that, as we have come to suspect, this world and everything
in it is the product of an outside agency.</i>

My scalp crinkled with fear. "Are you saying Miss Havisham is, is
<i>God</i>?"

<i>Everything is relative, Gable, but I fear she may be the keystone in
our	particular vault of heaven</i>.

Inarticulate rage made me snarl and clench my fists. 

"Should I be worried?"

A voice from behind made me start. I required a moment's composure; time
to force a smile into my voice. "It's nothing that I can't handle,
Stephanie."

Stephanie Collins was my current paramour;
over the years I'd watched her
grow from gangly child into voluptuous womanhood. She was possessed of a
keen wit and an intelligence to rival my own, choosing the role of
Infernal consort over that of social matriarch. I almost felt flattered,
but our liaison was obviously the product of enlightened self-interest,
nothing more.

She swept forward in a rustle of skirts to stand by my side; one hand on
hip, the other resting on my shoulder. "No change in our sleeping
beauty, I see?"

"None, but I'm sure she'd be touched by your concern."

"Pah! I'm well aware of the <i>intimacy</i> the three of you share when
she's awake, so you'll forgive me for enjoying her continued absence.
I'd just as soon see an end to her."

"We're in danger. All of us. Everything." As soon as the words escaped
my lips I regretted  uttering them, but nothing is as corrosive as
knowledge you cannot share. And if anyone could appreciate how
precarious our situation had become it was Stephanie - for Pygar seemed
possessed of a wilfully anti-intellectual bent that drove me to
distraction.

I felt Stephanie stiffen. "I did not think her prone to jealousy."

Her self-centred concern made me laugh, despite everything. "Aurelia
turns to Pygar for tenderness, myself for debauchery, and others for
general lassitude. I very much doubt she harbours any resentment at our
dalliance during those times she absents herself."

Stephanie pursed her lips. "Dalliance? Is that all I am to you?"

I squeezed her heavy rear. "A rose by any other name would smell as
sweet."

She frowned. "Meaning?"

"Meaning that regardless of how I refer to you, you will always be as
dear to me as you are now."

She snorted in a most unladylike way, but a slight smile played on her
lips. "Always one with the silken tongue, Gable. But if not jealousy,
what threatens us?"

So much for deflecting the impact of my ill-judged outburst. I took a
deep breath. "Have you never questioned why Haven is the only remaining
city on Earth?"

Stephanie looked at me askance. "Everything beyond the Ring Mountains is
gone. But you ask me of history? You who lived through it?"

"I'm merely immortal, not infallible. I forget names if not faces, dates
if not experiences. Yet when I think back to the Fall, the foundation of
Haven, my memories are always the same. Incomplete but unchanging, like
a stage play repeated again and again, always following the same
script."

"And this troubles you?"

"I believe…" I stroked my thin moustache, "…I <i>fear</i> that this
world of ours was created little more than four decades ago."

My paramour stepped back. "My parents were no mere figment of my
imagination, I assure you."

"No, no, they were real enough, but their memories, everything they knew
to be true, that is another matter."

"What arrant nonsense, Gable, have you lost your mind? Or do you believe
that God intervened to preserve us within this mountainous ark?"

"No, not God." I gestured towards the sleeping form of Aurelia Havisham.
"Her."

Stephanie stood with hands on hips, chin tilted in defiance. "Her? The
Lady
Eternal is no deity. She does not command the birds to sing or the rain
to fall from the sky. The way she takes her <i>earthly</i> pleasures is
not the	stuff of worship, even amongst those young men she favours."

"No deity? Certainly, but still I believe all <i>this</i> was fashioned
to a
design of her choosing."

Anger darkened her face. "A sham? Worlds within worlds? And what then
are we save actors on a stage of dreams? No, Gable, no - I'll not be
gulled by anyone, not even our Lady." Stephanie drew a slim blade
through a
slit in her overskirt and raised it above her head.

I seized her wrist as she advanced towards the bed, pulling her close so
that our lips almost touched. "Be not so hasty, my love. We may all wait
upon sweet Aurelia's pleasure in one way or another, but she's no tyrant
to be cast down by a petticoat assassin. Not even one as beautiful as
you." We kissed, even as I squeezed her wrist until the stiletto dropped
to the floor.

Stephanie glared at me with eyes of wet stone. "What then are
<i>you</i>,
Gable? A body-slave sworn to protect her? Do we live or die at her
whim?"

<i>Gable</i>.

I seized her roughly by the upper arms. "Think on it, damn you. Without
<i>her</i> what use does the universe have for <i>us</i>?"

<i>Gable, this is important</i>.

"Please forgive me for interrupting this lover's tiff, but perhaps
somewhere less public would be more appropriate?" It was the voice of
Aurelia Havisham.

Stephanie twisted free from my grasp and curtsied. "My Lady. We meant no
disrespect."

I took a moment to compose myself then turned, smiling. "My Lady."

Aurelia was sitting up in bed, clearly amused by our little tableau.
"Kindly leave us, Mistress Collins. Gable will be along presently to
smooth things over, whatever the cause of your, ah, disagreement."

Stephanie curtsied again and withdrew, giving me a baleful glare as she
passed. I responded with an exaggerated bow that provoked a defiant toss
of her head.

Despite having laid undisturbed for so long there was no sign of atrophy
as Aurelia rose from the bed. "In many ways she's the ideal match for
you, Gable. You should not antagonise her so wantonly."

I toyed with my moustache. "And yet, my dear, you remain the mistress of
my heart."

"You're a rogue and charlatan, Gable. Which is why you'll be forever at
my side." Aurelia walked over and opened the doors to her Juliet
balcony.
It was late May and scent from the rose garden filled the room. She
breathed deeply and smiled. "Oh, how I've missed <i>this</i>."

I stood close behind, fingertips resting on her shoulders, and kissed
the nape of her neck, her shoulder, the lobe of her ear. My voice was a
low growl. "Oh, how I've missed this."

In response she turned to face me, but placed a diminutive hand on my
chest and 'pushed' me away. "Was there something you wanted to ask me?"
Her face was bland, seemingly devoid of guile.

Ignorance may not have been bliss but it had its appeal. However I knew
this uncertainty would fester within me. I cleared my throat. "Is this
world a lie?"

Aurelia arched an eyebrow. "A lie? It's no mass illusion for your
benefit, if that's what you mean."

"You overheard us, you know damn well what I mean."

She sighed. "You no longer believe that Haven is a refuge designed to
survive the fall of a once-great civilization? You no longer believe
that we-three are its guardians?"

"I think it artifice, a folly, if one constructed on a gargantuan
scale."

"What first raised your suspicions? For forty years you've accepted this
version of events. What changed?"

"Library."

"Ah, yes, Library. He was always going to be a necessary evil. The
serpent in my Eden, if you will. What happened?"

"New information, impossible information, which I now see has somehow
leaked in from the real world."

"Haven has endured far longer than anyone thought possible, but nothing
lasts forever."

I drew myself up. "Is that why you returned, for a final visit? You
wished to deliver our death sentence in person?"

"If it were the end of the world, and nothing could be done to avert it,
would you <i>really</i> want to know?"

"The true test of a man is how he faces the inevitable."

Aurelia prodded me in the chest. "But <i>you</i> are no mere man, Gable,
<i>you</i> are the Devil incarnate. The embodiment of mankind's venal
pursuits, just as Pygar
represents his spiritual side."

"Words, words, but I hear no salvation in them. May the condemned man at
least know the capital crime of which he is guilty?"

She did not answer directly but turned away to stand at the balcony,
leaning on the wrought-iron railing. "Do you know why I chose the name
Aurelia Havisham?"

"So your identity is another falsehood? I suppose it hardly matters
now."

"Oh, the 'Aurelia' is true enough but 'Miss Havisham' is a literary
character, a young woman who becomes a recluse after being jilted at the
altar."

I heard the catch in her voice and said nothing.

"In my world, in the <i>real</i> world, I was an heiress. The beauty
barbers did what they could but I knew it was my wealth that lent me
allure. I could have accepted that, enjoyed the company of young men,
then younger men, but ultimately I'd become a figure of ridicule. Some
double-standards never die, apparently."

"Apparently."

"But then I met Simon. He was young, ambitious…" She glanced over her
shoulder, "…<i>vigorous</i>, and made no secret of wanting my fortune to
further his grandiose designs. And still I loved him. Our wedding was a
lavish affair, even by the standards of the day, and the Patriarch
himself agreed to officiate."

"You do not have to continue, Aurelia, I believe the outcome is clear."

"I reached the cathedral to find only the groomsman waiting. He handed
me a letter from Simon, hand-written at least. I have it still,
unopened."

"Aurelia-"

"I could not face the congregation, I could not face society. Like Miss
Havisham I retreated to my country estate but even that was not enough.
I needed to escape my world and everything, everyone, in it."

"And so you created Haven, by means I cannot begin to understand."

She laughed, although it was bitter-sweet at best. "This is the mote in
God's eye. A fraction of the universe folded in upon itself, hidden even
from divine scrutiny."

"Your world seems one of many wonders."

"My world? My world is ailing, Gable. It is exhausted, overcrowded,
devoid of hope. It is run by desperate men contemplating desperate
measures."

My mouth moved soundlessly for a few moments while my mind floundered
for a reply. "They, they would come <i>here</i>? Occupy our land,
enslave us?"

"Heavens, no!" Aurelia sounded genuinely amused at my naivety and I felt
my face burn with embarrassment. "Haven only exists as a reality-bubble
within the event horizon of an artificial singularity."

"I do not understand what that means, but I know that bubbles always
burst."

"Yes, bubbles always burst, but the pioneering technology I funded, the
way in which Haven was created, bought me a place at the top table, so
to speak. That same methodology will now be used on a vastly greater
scale to transmute all <i>this</i>…" She spread her arms as if to
encompass the world outside the window,"…into a second Earth, a virgin
canvas."

"Man would now rival God in his creation?"

I could hear the frown in her voice. "It's based on 'dark matter
manipulation', but do not ask me what that means." She hesitated for a
moment, "I understand that the process is not without risk."

Ah, so there it was. The open cell door that leads only to the scaffold.
Only with great effort did I keep the anger from my voice. "I did not
think you this cruel, my sweet. You could have watched from afar and
only explained matters after our miraculous transformation. Or mourned
our passing."

Aurelia sighed, "I am old, Gable, old beyond my time. This body,
<i>this</i> Aurelia, offers an escape from my decrepit carcass back in
the real world. In any event our fates are intertwined. Haven sprang
from my imagination and now it is I and I alone who must imprint that
vision onto the raw chaos of creation." She turned to face me, "Imagine,
I am to be the architect of a new world. My sisters in the Eastern Star
will venerate my name in ages to come."

I seized her, took her in my arms. "How long do we have? Is there yet
time enough for love?"

"The process is imminent, but you were always opportunistic."

I caressed her cheek. "And should this grand enterprise of yours come to
nought, what then?"

"Then God blinks…and nothing."

I laughed. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more."

She stared at me in obvious surprise. "Macbeth? Shakespeare at his most
pessimistic. However I would say The Tempest is more apt, given our
circumstances."

"The Tempest? Enlighten me."

Now it was Aurelia's turn to laugh. "O brave new world, that has such
people in it!"

"And shall there be room for all, on these virgin shores?"

"Well, I'm unsure what humanity in general will make of Pygar, but it
<i>certainly</i> isn't ready for the Devil himself."

I grinned, leaning in to kiss her. "Frankly, my dear, I don't
<i>give</i> a damn."

[*ITEM] Farny's Place

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good
design for a bus.<br><small>David Hockney</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>Held in suspension by an unseen balance of forces the
great globe hung low over the linked cluster of buildings in East Snoak.
From a distance its surface appeared perfectly reflective, but closer to
it displayed constantly swirling polychromatic patterns reminiscent of a
soap-bubble.  Every so often, to the delight of spectators, somewhere on
its periphery vagrant trails of colour would coalesce, and a luminous
blob would momentarily detach itself, before dissipating to leave a
slowly fading rainbow glow.

Designed by eminent architech Gurm Weiger, this installation was a
tribute to Farny Farglesharp, in celebration of twenty-five years of the
Art Market, which had its humble beginnings in what had once been an
abandoned hut, and now occupied a sprawling network of converted
warehouses set between the outer ring road around Praspafole Stadium and
the fashionably elegant glitter of Yarp Street. 

<p class=drop>Farny's parents had led busy working lives; his mother
Helba as a
consultant nutritionist, his father Teir as a soil analyst.  These
enlightened practitioners of scientific method did not attempt to impose
a career path on their gawky restless son, who for all his natural
inquisitiveness in his late teens had entered that phase of development
when intelligible communication seemed only permissible among peers.  At
home he spent valuable time contemplating his body-image, cultivating a
look of fierce concentration which closely resembled a defiant scowl,
and responding to polite questions with condensed packets of information
encoded as grunts. 

Eventually, out of genuine curiosity rather than rebellion, Farny had
chosen to enrol at Sparagulan College to study Art. He did not think of
himself as an aspiring artist, but had often gravitated to the art books
in his school library, and had definite preferences among the many works
reproduced, although he could not as yet explain why some gave him
pleasure, some left him feeling uncomfortable, while others failed to
leave much impression on him at all.  He knew enough to feel that in
those works that caught his interest there was something akin to a
conjuror's sleight of hand, and he wanted to pry out those secrets.

He was also curious to know why so many people devoted their lives to
art, and how exactly did one recognize a masterpiece?  What was it that
distinguished the truly exceptional from the merely highly accomplished?
And who were best qualified to be the arbiters: fellow-artists, cultural
historians, wealthy collectors or the democratic majority?

After a year under the tutelage of Lugfaus Goltz, Professorial Head of
the Art Department and a sculptor of some distinction, Farny was
slightly better informed, having acquired a grounding in art history and
techniques, but was more aware than before of the limits of his
knowledge.  In the second year Goltz encouraged his students to
experiment, allowing them to discover for themselves the
transformational potential of solid materials; how easily they could be
carved, moulded, filed, chiselled, glued or welded into a desired shape.
They were asked to examine examples of different rocks and minerals to
determine their artistic potential.  Farny became fascinated by the
chemistry of pigments.  At home, with the benefit of helpful guidance
from the respective disciplines of Teir and Helba, using an array of
powdered and liquefied substances, he worked out for himself how to
create the most satisfying colours.

By the end of the third and final year, although the answers to some of
his larger questions remained elusive, Farny Farglesharp thought he
might have found his métier.  He had studied the philosophies underlying
successive artistic movements, and could identify the work of their best
exponents.  Professor Goltz had succeeded in teasing out his latent
skills, and if called upon, he could now produce a convincing portrait,
landscape or abstract composition with an implement as rudimentary as a
burnt twig.  He could fashion a themed collage from found objects.  He
had worked with fabrics, wood, clay, glass, metal, stone and artificial
materials, and now had an understanding of the range of tools and
craftsmanship required.  But his real enthusiasm was for the palette;
for the spectrum of paints, inks and dyes which lent richness and
subtlety to the artist's chosen surface.

<p class=drop>Among his most like-minded college friends was Pirian
Leems, a quietly
studious painter of exquisite miniatures.  Shortly after graduating they
decided to spend some time travelling abroad. Pirian was not only widely
read, but possessed the enviable knack of being able to locate,
seemingly by instinct, the best cuisine and the most stimulating
beverages for the lowest possible price in any given area.  Farny, who
suspected that Pirian possessed a remarkable combination of keen
observation and an acute sense of smell, had casually wondered aloud
whether this vital ability only worked in Snoak, or would it also apply
in foreign parts?  Pirian had risen to the challenge, and they had soon
concluded that there were after all other important reasons for
undertaking such a trip.   With a list of contacts gathered from Farny's
own researches and supplemented by a few names cajoled from Lugfaus
Goltz, together they visited workshops and studios, a host of galleries,
a marine processing plant, an industrial chemist, a spice merchant and
various retailers of craft materials.  Needless to say, Pirian's
tracking aptitude was put to the test, and he unerringly led the way to
a succession of taverns, cafés, refectories and restaurants of which
Farny had seen no advance notice, and was duly deeply impressed.  Four
months later, brimming with enthusiasm, convivial memories, a wealth of
useful knowledge and such a large quantity of samples they had to invest
in a glidecart, they embarked on their return journey.

The hut had belonged to Pirian Leems' grandfather, who had once burdened
its shelves with grey slabs bearing the imprint of cycads, lumps of
stone harbouring ancient trilobites, and other dark, weighty evidence of
long-perished life.  These fossils had been auctioned after his
grandfather's death, as the old man had stipulated, to Pirian's later
financial benefit, although the lad would have been content with his
childhood gift of a small polished ammonite whose chambered helical
geometry had always fascinated him, and which he still cherished.  The
hut had remained empty and abandoned until his friend Farny had
half-jokingly mentioned that he needed somewhere to play with his
pigments, and gradually the idea took shape of a colour laboratory which
could function as a practical enterprise, perhaps even a profitable one.
Farny was confident he could manufacture many of his products more
cheaply than most of those sold commercially, and he could guarantee
their superior quality.  He planned on supplementing his specialist
pigments with a carefully selected range of other art and craft
materials obtained at a discount from reputable suppliers.

Pirian was happy to spend some of what he called his "fossil fund" on
refurbishing the hut.  He had it virtually rebuilt, with the addition of
plumbing facilities, light-sensitive windows and
thermostatically-controlled storage containers, and had ordered a few
items of automated equipment "…to lessen the chance of injury and to
reduce unnecessary mess," as he explained.  Grimy and dishevelled after
sorting and bundling a fresh batch of willow charcoal, Farny conceded
that he was willing to make sensible compromises.  As a mutually agreed
afterthought, at the back they added an extended porch or corridor which
served as a gallery in which to display and sell on commission the best
work they could find by promising artists in any medium.  This section
initially housed some of Pirian's miniatures and a bronze entitled
<i>Frogsplash 2</i>, generously donated by Lugfaus Goltz.

After a further six weeks of preparation Farny and Pirian began
advertising the Art Hut. The College magazine <i>Splark!</i> ran a
full-page
feature, and they distributed handouts and placed posters on notice
boards in as many of Snoak's public places as would have them, and even
along a few random thoroughfares like 20bird Lane, The Scruttings and
Upper Stirrow Bridge.  The offer of free samples to the first fifty
visitors was a bit of a gamble, but paid dividends by attracting not
only the anticipated groups of college students, but also the curiosity
and admiration of a few people with a professional interest and greater
spending power.

Within a year the Art Hut had an established clientèle, regular orders
from several studios and educational institutions (including Sparagulan
College), and was ready to start expanding.  Pirian's miniatures were
selling well, and other painters and sculptors whose work they both
respected were seeking gallery space, including the Post-Prandialist
Irkel Upquap, then at work on progressively more convoluted versions of
his looping structures in polished metal: brightly interweaving ribbons
varying in thickness from that of a spoon handle to the girth of a human
torso.  The sculptor described these as 'experiments in non-contiguous
spatial dynamics', although one unkind critic said the effect was of a
roller-coaster being digested by a drunken snake. Another interested
potential exhibitor was the young Tortica Doublebud, already notorious
for her innovative series of interactive metaportraits, where the
sensation of eyes following you around the room was manifested in ways
that some found physically intrusive.

Over the next few years Farny and Pirian negotiated with Commercial
Planning at Central over the acquisition and conversion of the nearby
derelict buildings, formerly transport depots before the advent of
freightway and podport.  Once reconstruction was satisfactorily in
progress they set about recruiting additional staff.  There was no
shortage of applicants from the College, both among students seeking
part-time work and among recent graduates.  Pirian, who had often wished
to devote more time to his painting, gradually withdrew from direct
participation in the business.  It was he who suggested that the complex
should be renamed Farglesharp's Art Market in honour of Farny's
extraordinary commitment and enterprise.

By the time the largest of the former depots was approved for
renovation, Farny had agreed to sponsor a College competition for the
best design, the only specification being that the building was to be
used primarily as a display space for works both two-and
three-dimensional.  The students' entries ranged from the
uncomplicatedly minimalist (internal space left totally empty) to the
seriously expensive (sliding walls, retractable ramps, adjustable stair
units, mobile plinths, anacoustic recesses, variable glow chambers,
modular formstax, Trovius cabinets and motion-activated hotos).  The
winning design, awarded a cash prize and a generous gift box of art
materials, was a sensible compromise between optimal natural light and
stylishly discreet toilet facilities.

The finished building became the venue for some memorable exhibitions:
Kreft Nuyl's monumental <i>Sailstones</i>, whose appearance belied their
true fragility, the magnificent <i>Black Fire</i> tapestries of Tosmor
Shaunt, and the <i>Hundred Hidden Doors</i>, that tantalizingly
labyrinthine creation of Hirelle Degdard, from which bemused spectators
would emerge in a trance-like state, having lost all sense of time,
place and direction.  The artist herself modestly declined to be
interviewed, stating only that she would like her work to speak for
itself.  This did not prevent critics from offering their own
interpretations, but the consensus was that moving through the gauzy
intricacy of this structure was a unique and mysterious experience.
Lurid reports appeared in the Quanderpyre Press alleging that two people
wearing short cloaks and thought to be from Smatparrox had actually
failed to re-appear after entering this exhibit, but these reports were
never substantiated.  The two people were not identified, although Ebby
Blates at the Multimart was overheard saying that she wouldn't be
surprised if they turned out to be those two arty friends of her second
husband's cousin Zole.

<p class=drop>Curiously enough, at about that time there seemed to have
been a spate
of rumours about people from Smatparrox going missing, but it took more
than uncorroborated gossip to disturb the equanimity of Snoak City
residents, hardly any of whom are likely to have known either of the two
acquaintances of Ebby Blates' husband's cousin.  These two currently
unemployed Smatparrox-based individuals were in fact Fucis Gawl and
Legger Rambersack, who shared the slight distinction of having had a few
dyspeptic poems published in local hand-printed magazines with
(numerically) a very modest readership.  To assert their dedication to
the muse they had taken to wearing cravats, silk-lined capes and
wide-brimmed black hats in an emulous attempt to revive what they
believed was a once fashionable literary tradition, but most people
assumed they had been hired to perform tricks at a children's party.  As
it happened, at the time of the alleged vanishing among the <i>Hundred
Hidden Doors</i> they were on home ground, sitting at their habitual
table in Quoil's, having an intensely heated argument about boiled eggs;
specifically, whether a boiled egg with its shell removed is more
correctly described as 'shelled' or 'unshelled'.  They both passionately
believed that such debates about the nuances of language could only
enhance their development as poets.  If Farny Farglesharp can achieve
public recognition in only a quarter of a century, who is to say that
the names of Gawl and Rambersack may not yet be honoured by posterity?

</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop> The truck's suspension was so effective it
felt like sitting in a small, canopied aerodrome rather than the back of
an armoured vehicle. Jacob watched the briefing. He'd aged a lot in the
last fourteen months. He hesitated to say 'hardened'--it was too close
to what he'd done to the ants. </p> <p>

<i>From myrmecologist to miscreationist.</i> </p> <p>

Scientists, doctors had always hidden their work behind a wall of Latin
names. It was why Harrison had been brought in by the P.R. department to
deliver today's briefing. </p> <p>

<i>"'Roy boss?'"</i> asked one of the marines, or whatever soldiers
called themselves these days. The scientific briefing was part of their
orientation, given in order to explain some of the equipment the marines
would be carrying into battle when they arrived at the fields. </p> <p>

"<i>Rooibos</i>," Harrison corrected. "It's a type of South African tea.
A while ago, a fellow called Nortier had the job of trying to cultivate
the plant in order to increase production but found that the seeds were
tiny and that, when ripe, the seedpods burst them all over the place.
Then a local Khoi woman showed him how the resident black ants collected
up the seeds and stored them in their nests. Hey presto: automated seed
collection. </p> <p>
 "More
recently, the same method had been extrapolated in order to have ants
collect something more valuable." Harrison looked his way, but Jacob
already had his game-face on. "They persuaded ants to collect gold and
silver deposits and bring them back to their nests where the metals
could then be harvested. Think of it like bees collecting minute
particles of pollen that eventually give us honey." </p> <p>
 <i>Or
oysters turning grains of sand into pearls</i>, thought Jacob at the
inaccurate comparison. It didn't matter: as long as the men in the truck
knew they weren't here to rescue civilians but silos. </p> <p>
 "And
it worked&#8230;" </p> <p>
 <i>We
wouldn't be here if it hadn't.</i> But sometimes you could be too
clever, and sometimes things could work too well&#8230; </p> <p>
 "The
company used pheromones to direct the ants to collect metal deposits and
rewarded them with foodstuffs to instil the right behaviour. The
ants' own tandem-learning instilled the behaviour throughout the nest.
Unlike seed collection, there are no seasonal restraints, and so the
ants keep stockpiling the whole year round. The company had to mix many
different strains to get just the ant they wanted. The resultant
mutant&#8230;" </p> <p>

--<i>One man's mutant is another man's superhero</i>, Jacob thought.
Although, granted, no one had ever put a cape on Doc Frankenstein's
creation-- </p> <p>

"&#8230;was a metal-collector extraordinaire." </p> <p>
 And
now the monster story took its inevitable downturn. </p> <p>

"Unfortunately, the ants had other ideas-they didn't want to give up
what they'd collected." </p> <p>
 "What
does an ant want with gold?" a marine asked. </p> <p>
 "It
wasn't just gold they ended up collecting. They got a taste for metal.
Not to eat it-they're not stupid--they used it to reinforce their nests
and turn them into little, armoured Fort Knoxes." </p> <p>
 "Why
are <i>we</i> here? Why not just send in pest exterminators?" </p> <p>
 "Tell
them," Jacob said when Harrison faltered. </p> <p>

"Because ants protect what's theirs. Come here, Kenner." A marine more
laden down with bits and pieces than a husband accompanying his wife to
the spring sales stepped forward. There were grunts of amusement. The
explanation of Kenner's equipment would run like the safety procedures
delivered by a flight attendant prior to take-off. </p> <p>
 "The
ants use chemical warfare, so you need to keep your bio suit on at all
times. Some species of ants use propaganda pheromones which can cause
their enemies to turn and attack each other&#8230;" </p> <p>
<i>Polyergus rufescens</i> , Jacob thought. " </p> <p> Or acetophenones
to immobilise an enemy." <i>Malaysian capmonotus cylindricus. </i>"They
can even release oleic acid to encourage necrophoric behaviour." <i>Atta
mexicana.</i> </p> <p>
 There
was a dirty laugh. </p> <p>
 "It
means removal of their dead. They keep their homes clean. Their chemical
agents include formic acid..." <i>Formicinae</i>. "&#8230;alkaloids and
piperidines." <i>Solenopsis fire ants</i>. "The ants, gentlemen, are
fighting back." </p> <p> Jacob was impressed that Harrison held the
men's gazes after that B-Movie tagline Jacob nodded for the briefing to
continue. </p> <p>
 "Ants
are master architects. But, apart from reinforcing their nests, there
are unconfirmed rumours this new breed are also reinforcing their
exoskeletons. They bite, they sting, they spray, and they inject."
Bottoms shifted uncomfortably in their seats. It was about time. Jacob
leaned forward, anticipating the inevitable round of home remedies. </p>
<p> 
"Why don't we just flood the fields and drown them?" </p> <p>
 "Some
ants switch to anaerobic respiration underwater." <i>Camponotus
anderseni.</i> "Some even go so far as to drink the water in the nest,
then excrete it outside." <i>Cataulacus muticus. </i> </p> <p>
 The
thing with mixing the breeds was you got all the features you
wanted&#8230;and forgot about the shared features you didn't. </p> <p>

"Couldn't we just starve them out?" </p> <p>
 "They
can grow their own food supply." <i>Fungus-growing leafcutter ants</i>.
"They even farm their own livestock." <i>Mealy bugs </i>and<i>
myrmecophilous caterpillars</i> being the cattle of choice. </p> <p>
 Hell,
<i>Protomognathus americanus</i> even caught and kept their own slaves.
</p> <p>
 "What
about a great big magnifying glance and a hot sun?" one wag said in
order to lighten the mood. Jacob joined in with the laughter until some
other marine said, "Why don't we just drop a bomb on the entire damned
field?" </p> <p>
 Jacob
stood up and made sure he could be seen. "Because the value of that
field is in excess of the gross national product of a middle-sized
European economy. You shall therefore be going in with a new spray which
will neutralise the threat, but preserve the assets. Any questions?"
</p> <p>
 Jacob
saw the wide-eyes of the marines as they backed up, pointing at
something behind him. He turned in time to see the rest of Harrison
dissolve into the billions of ants that had formerly made him. </p> <p>

<i>Myrmarachne plataleoides</i>, Jacob thought as they raced up
his legs. One more trick. The ability to mimic their enemies. </p> <p>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"I'm Dominic Vecchio, Chief of Security.
This is Officer Parks."

While Parks appeared to be no more than muscle in a cheap suit there
was an air of cynical intelligence about Vecchio that I found
unsettling. He looked like the kind of man who believed everyone lied as
a matter of course. 

Despite my apprehension I managed to smile. "Donald Cain. Please,
gentlemen, take a seat". 

I'd remained in my executive armchair when Abigail ushered in my two
uninvited guests; a cheap move, designed to show I wasn't in the least
intimidated by this intrusion. Vecchio unbuttoned his jacket so that it
hung wide to reveal the Glock on his hip. An equally cheap move, but one
that had the desired effect of increasing my sense of unease. I
retaliated by not offering them any refreshments. Score one for petty
power-play. 

He shot a cuff. "We haven't met before, Director, as I was on
compassionate leave when you joined us here at Horst Energie. My thanks
for <i>finally</i> finding time to see me, given your busy schedule."


I ignored the obvious sarcasm - Vecchio had been bombarding me with
weekly requests for some four months - and continued the exchange of
pleasantries. "Well, bureaucracy expands to fill the time available, as
they say." My smile slid towards sympathetic concern, "And my
condolences, Chief, on the loss of your father." 

Vecchio flinched like I'd struck him in the face, then made an
obvious effort to relax. "This isn't a social call, Director." 

"No? Obviously if I'd realised this was to be more than just a
delayed 'meet and greet' it would have been afforded a higher priority.
So, what seems to be the problem?" 

"The problem is that immediately on taking up post you placed this
entire compound off-limits to all non-departmental personnel, including
security. I'm supposed to be responsible for the entire site only to be
told my presence here is by invitation only? I trust you appreciate that
your self-imposed isolation has seriously undermined my authority." 

I ran Area Two, one of four which went to make up the Horst research
and development facility in the wilds of New Mexico. Each campus was
lavishly equipped such that few staff ever felt the need to venture
beyond the perimeter, and my 'Berlin Wall' regime had been accepted with
barely a murmur. 

From my own personnel, that is. Despite Vecchio's open irritation I
kept up the light-hearted approach. "Oh, our 'self-imposed isolation',
as you put it, Chief, is simply due to the extremely sensitive nature of
the work we do here. My department includes a three-man team of private
security contractors who are more than capable of dealing with any petty
disputes and trivial infractions. However, if you're unhappy at being
out-of-the-loop then may I suggest you lodge a formal complaint through
the appropriate channels." 

"Gee, whiz, wish I'd thought of that. Of course I objected, only to
be told you're protected from on high. I had to call in a few markers to
even get this far, so I suppose I should be thankful you've acknowledged
I exist." 

"We've simply had no call for your services, Chief, although if
circumstances dictate otherwise I'd certainly value your input. However
I'm happy to say that during my tenure as Director of Operations
everything has run extremely smoothly, extremely smoothly indeed." 

Vecchio pursed his lips. "Really? Then what about the death of Serge
Danner? It happened over three months ago but I only got to hear about
it yesterday." 

I waved a hand in a dismissive gesture. "That was no more than an
unfortunate industrial accident. Technician Danner fell from one of the
overhead gantries in the materials storage area and broke his neck. I
happened to be first on the scene and, before you ask, there was no-one
else in the vicinity, no suggestion of foul play. Our medical officer
certified his injuries were consistent with a tragic mishap." 

"Yet there was no CCTV coverage of the area in question. Quite an
oversight given the, as you put it, 'extremely sensitive nature' of your
work here." 

"I'm not <i>au fait</i> with the technicalities but apparently the
high-energy fields being generated play havoc with the surveillance
grid. Building infrastructure lies outside my remit and Central don't
consider it cost-effective to install shielded cabling. If you have any
complaints concerning this state of affairs then I suggest you take the
matter up with Accounting." 

"I find your attitude complacent, Director, if not bordering on
actual negligence." 

I sat back and steepled my fingers, "And I find <i>your</i> attitude
bordering on an abuse of process, Vecchio. A crude and somewhat obvious
attempt to parlay this trumped-up investigation into an expression of
superiority, simply because our seclusion is an itch you can't scratch."


He snorted. "I didn't strong-arm Central simply to make a point in
some petty turf war, if that's what you mean. No, a security situation
has arisen and I need to know what it is you're doing in Area Two,
Director. Specifically, what is Project Mote?" 

I glared at him. "Even that designation is highly classified. Look,
what is this about? Security situation? What kind of security situation?
Nothing has happened recently which would warrant your attention and, as
I've explained, Danner's death was a simple accident - end of story."


"Then consider my visit as a kind of epilogue to that sorry little
tale. You recruited one Sara Hotchkiss to replace Danner." 

I blinked, momentarily thrown by the shift in conversation. "Well,
no, not personally. I'm an administrator, a project manager, and as such
I'm not qualified to vet candidates on technical matters. The job
specification was passed to Human Resources and they presented us with
Miss Hotchkiss in due course. I understand Professor Koenig was involved
in the interview process and he's quite a stickler for detail, so I'm
sure we employed only the very best. I've certainly not received any
negative feedback concerning Miss Hotchkiss, she seems most competent."


Vecchio almost smiled. "Sara Hotchkiss doesn't exist."

I stared at him. "What? "My mouth suddenly felt dry and I had to
cough before continuing, "What do you mean by that?" 

"She came to us from Aries Telecom?"

"Yes, I believe so. She worked there as a technical analyst. Her
background made her a near-perfect candidate. They gave her an excellent
reference." 

Vecchio toyed with his cufflink. "Not according to Aries. In fact
no-one of that name has ever worked for them, in any capacity, at any of
their sites. I've been in contact with my opposite number and we now
believe their personnel database was hacked prior to our checking her
references, then restored so they wouldn't detect the presence of a
phantom former employee. Obviously Aries are keen to ensure this breach
of security doesn't become public knowledge, so we can count on their
continued co-operation." 

I poured myself a glass of water from the crystal beaker on my desk
and took a sip before replying - as much to give myself time to think as
soothe a parched throat. "It sounds like you've uncovered nothing more
than a database glitch, Chief. A flaw in their systems, not ours." 

He shook his head. "Sara Hotchkiss has a driving licence, social
security number, an extensive credit history. There are school records,
her university degree, even two traffic tickets for speeding - but these
are all on-line. In every photograph of her as an adult, be it her
graduation or a corporate PR release, Sara is always in the back row or
on the edge of the group in question. That is to say, in the prime
position for an inserted image." 

"You're saying that her past has been doctored? Some kind of extreme
CV inflation?" 

"I'm saying that her past is a complete fabrication." Vecchio
shifted slightly in his seat and a hint of doubt crept into his voice,
"Possibly. For now we've held off chasing the paper trail, the
corroborating hard-copy documentation, in case this was the aim all
along." 

I frowned. "I'm sorry, I don't understand."

"If it comes to light that Horst security is conducting a
witch-hunt, especially when it implicates a major enterprise like
Project Mote, then the effect on share price would be devastating. If
someone knew to expect this beforehand they could make a killing." 

"So this, ah, crisis of confidence in Miss Hotchkiss has been
engineered, designed solely to manipulate the stock market?" 

"That's one theory, yes."

I let myself relax slightly. "Well, I think you're chasing shadows,
Chief. The outside world knows nothing, <i>nothing</i>, of what's going
on in here. So I suggest you go ahead as planned. After all, reviewing
one employee history is hardly going to bring the sky down on our heads
now, is it?" 

Vecchio shook his head. "You're too isolated in here, Director, your
appreciation is too insular. The balance sheet doesn't lie and it's
obvious from the last published set of accounts that your department
represents a major, even critical, investment on behalf of Horst.
Anything which reflects badly on your enterprise reflects badly on the
company as a whole." 

"I almost feel flattered. Anyway, there's one crucial element in all
of this that you seem to have overlooked in your rush to judgement."


"Oh? Then kindly enlighten me."

"Why would anyone fabricate a work history for Sara Hotchkiss as an
Aries employee unless they <i>knew</i> we were seeking a replacement for
the unfortunate Danner? Hum? Tell me that? This arcology is incorporated
as a municipal body with its own coroner, fire department, even its own
police force." I smiled, "That would be you, by the way. Danner had no
family, no dependants, so his death went unreported outside the
boundaries of our petty kingdom. So you see, Chief Vecchio, being
somewhat insular <i>does</i> have its advantages." 

"You're correct, Director Cain. No-one could have anticipated a
vacancy would arise, especially not the specific vacancy brought about
by the loss of technician Danner." Vecchio's face hardened, "Unless his
death wasn't accidental." 

I stared at him, sudden fear making my scalp tighten. "You're saying
he was <i>murdered</i>? No, no, I can't believe someone amongst us could
be capable of that." 

"It's only one possibility, I admit, but one that can't be ignored.
Look, if Danner <i>was</i> killed that means there's already an insider.
That's why it's so important I understand what it is you're doing. If I
arrest Hotchkiss, what threat could her accomplice pose to the success
of your project, to the safety of the facility? You must be candid,
Director, for all our sakes." 

I sat back, floundering for a response that wouldn't leave me
looking either self-serving or incompetent. The chair detected my tense
shoulders and began a vibrating massage that took me a few moments to
shut off. I cleared my throat. "Teleportation. Teleportation as a mass
transit medium." 

Vecchio raised an eyebrow. "What, as in 'beam me up, Scotty'? I
thought that technology had pretty much hit a brick wall." 

"The conventional approach, most certainly. That deals with mass
converted into energy, transmitting that energy to another location, and
recreated the original mass from that energy." I allowed myself a small
smile, "But energy doesn't 'remember' what is was, where it came from,
and no transmission method is ever one-hundred-percent efficient, so why
bother? At present the only transfer that takes place is the template,
the item blueprint, and the original is lost forever." 

"What you're describing is just a standard nanofax. You can't put
living matter through one of those." 

"Of course not, even the quickest biomass printer can't produce a
viable organism - and certainly not a sentient one. It is, as you say, a
brick wall." 

He frowned. "Don't play games, Director, what have you achieved that
makes your project so damned important?" 

"Project Mote has side-stepped the problem entirely. Using spatial
compression and gravimetric confinement we're now able to shrink an area
approximately two metres in diameter down to the size and mass of a
photon - ah, part of a beam of light. We then <i>physically </i>transmit
this photon 'bus' to a new location where the contents expand back to
normal size. The beauty of this system is that it utilises existing
fibre optic and laser communications technology. All you need on the
receiving end is the means to de-encrypt the transmission header and
project the incoming packet into an appropriate empty space. At
present the compression only lasts for three-point-two seconds so,
obviously, timing is everything." 

Vecchio took a deep breath and expelled it. "Christ, you're talking
about making all existing forms of transportation redundant overnight.
If this comes to market it will make an awful lot of people <i>very</i>
unhappy, assuming the technology doesn't simply get militarised." His
eyes narrowed, "And you can send people through this?" 

"Oh yes. Well, so far all we're done is move rats and a monkey from
one side of the lab to the other, with no apparent ill-effects. We're
still months away from human trials using volunteers." 

"OK, OK, but what about interstellar travel? Because if you've
cracked <i>that</i> then I know of several corporations who'd happily
crater this facility and damn the consequences." 

I shook my head. "Oh, no, you only have the volume of air that's
been compressed within the transmission sphere. More than enough if all
you're doing is sending a beam of light around the globe, but it would
still take five years or so to reach the nearest star. This system will
be limited to Earth orbit, the Moon, maybe Mars if you took your own
oxygen supply." 

"Small mercies, but gratefully received." The Chief turned to his
colleague. "Right, we'll need to double our surveillance footprint, so
get onto Central for at least another two satellites. Dig out the survey
we did for potential anti-missile sites. I'll want a full deployment of
mobile batteries within thirty minutes of authorisation, so don't take
any shit from the arsenal over this. Perimeter drones we can beef up
from local resources." He rubbed his chin, "OK, that only leaves a
railgun attack. Can't do much about that apart from keeping tabs on any
potential airborne platforms. Contact Ops about hacking civilian
air-traffic control, including the capacity to send false transmissions.
Anything you want to add?" 

Parks blinked, slowly, before replying. "On-site EMP detonation by
means of covert infiltration, compromised security personnel, or
compromised civilian staff. Same goes for the release of chemical or
biological agents. We'll need to start extensive background checks
across the board. Like you said, sir, a witch hunt." 

I held up a hand. "Gentlemen, please! You make it sound like someone
is about to declare war on us. Are all these elaborate precautions
really necessary?" 

Vecchio laughed, although there was no humour in his voice. "If I
was on the outside, and learned what it is you're cooking up, I'd make
damn sure we stole the technology before any patent was filed. Either
that or ensure Project Mote goes down in flames. Which brings us back to
Sara Hotchkiss. Despite the risks, I'm inclined to remove her from the
equation right here, right now." 

"But doesn't it make more sense to leave things as they are until we
can identify her accomplice? You said yourself that arresting Sara could
precipitate matters and all we need is a few more weeks, perhaps two
months at most, to prove the technology works." 

He shook his head. "No, I'll confront her, then match whatever
amount she's been offered to spy on us, plus relocation and a new
identity. If she's acting under duress then things get a bit more
complicated, but I have personnel who can remove pressure just as easily
as it's been applied." 

"You'd really do all that?"

"Of course not, but it's obvious <i>you</i> believed me and you're a
cynical, heartless, bureaucrat." Vecchio gave me a thin-lipped smile,
"I've read your file." 

I took my time before replying; removing a bottle of Scotch from the
pedestal desk drawer and adding a generous measure to my glass. The
whiskey swirled like smoke through the mineral water - my uncertain
future as a Brownian motion metaphor. "Who else knows you're here apart
from Abigail, my personal assistant? She brought you in, but did you
encounter anyone else, even just passing them in the corridor?" 

"I'm way ahead of you Director. If we have to 'disappear' Sara
Hotchkiss then the best cover story is a medical emergency. That
wouldn't hold water if everyone knew corporate security were taking an
interest. I'm assuming your assistant and medical officer can be trusted
to co-operate?" 

"Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Ah, well, do you want me call her in
here, to my office? Sara, I mean." 

"Yes, let's get things moving."

I took a swig from my glass before pressing the intercom. "Abigail?
Would you be so kind as to contact Sara Hotchkiss and ask her to come
and see me. Tell her I need to review the final transmission protocols.
Just send her straight in when she arrives, no need to stand on
ceremony." 

<i>"Certainly, Director, I'll get right on it."</i>

Another mouthful did nothing to calm my nerves. "And now we wait."


Less than five minutes, as it turned out.

There was a knock and Vecchio raised a hand to stop me replying
immediately. He and Parks stood and turned to face the door before
nodding to me. 

I cleared my throat. "Come in."

Sara Hotchkiss entered holding a manila folder. She was an athletic
brunette with close-cropped hair; handsome rather than pretty but
definitely attractive if you liked strong women. To her credit she
seemed unruffled by the reception committee, regarding the two security
officers calmly before looking in my direction. "Director?" 

I lifted the 
Bergman pistol from my open desk drawer
and shot both Vecchio and Parks in the back of the head.

Blood and brain matter sprayed across Sara's face, blouse and lab
coat. She barely flinched. The bodies fell to my plush carpet making no
sound. The Bergman was a low-velocity, gas-powered gun designed for use
in orbit As such it made an excellent, if short-range, assassination
weapon down here on Earth. It had been supplied by my private security
contractors, no questions asked, given my privileged position. I placed
the gun on the desk and tried to smile. 

Sara tossed the folder aside and wiped her face with her sleeve.
"Christ, you weren't joking when you specified 'final protocols'. We're
blown then?" 

"Oh, yeah, and then some. Vecchio turned out to be a petty-minded
little shit and your CV fell apart under close scrutiny. Just as well he
didn't give mine the third-degree as well." 

"OK, now what? I take it simply running away isn't an option?"

I finished my drink. "Well, I might be able to walk out of here but
I'm fairly sure your card is marked." 

Her face twisted into a bitter smile. "Oh, great. You kill this pair
but it's me who gets thrown to the wolves? Thanks for nothing." 

"That's not what I meant and you know it. Look, use my restroom to
get cleaned up as best you can. I need to lay some groundwork if we're
to avoid spending the next twenty years in a corporate gulag. Assuming
we don't just end up as landfill." 

Sara glared at me before vanishing next door. I heard water running.
Another drink had its appeal but the first shot already lay like a sour
cinder in my gut. I pressed the intercom. "Abigail?" 

<i>"Yes, sir?"</i>

"I need you to contact Catering and have them lay on a full
hospitality package in the conference suite. Top of the line, no expense
spared. We'll also need the side room for less illustrious guests -
security personnel and the like." 

<i>"Certainly, Director. Can you give me any indication as to
expected numbers?"</i> 

"Not at this stage, no, but I'll just bring in senior staff as
required if the room is going to look a bit underpopulated. Well, the
presentable ones, at any rate" 

I could hear the smile in her voice. <i>"Yes, sir, I'll draw up a
shortlist. What kind of time-scale are we working to?"</i> 

"Another unknown, I'm afraid. Security have just given me the
heads-up but all <i>they</i> know is that this visit is 'imminent'.
Look, you'd better go down and supervise things personally, we can't
afford any slip-ups where Board members are concerned." 

<i>"No problem, sir, I'll make sure everything goes as smooth as
silk."</i> 

"Thank you, Abigail, I don't know what I'd do without you. Get
yourself an extra-special present from me come Christmas." She laughed.


I sat back in my chair, breathing heavily. After a few minutes Sara
emerged and I saw her nose crinkle with disgust - the smell of blood and
bowel was now impossible to ignore. Her face was clean and although the
blouse betrayed damp patches they were easily overlooked against the
dark blue cotton. 

She barely glanced at the bodies. "I can do nothing with my lab
coat." 

"Doesn't matter, there's a service store between here and the lab
and you're bound to find one there. Remember to take your ID and pens,
and that folder. Everything has to look as close as it did when you were
last there." 

Sara took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. "I know what it is
you've got planned, it's the only way out for both of us. Be honest, do
you really think we stand a chance?" 

"If I say 'in theory'-"

"You'll get a slap."

I managed a brief smile, just a twitch of my lips. "Then how about
'on paper' everything should work just fine?" 

"Oh, <i>much</i> more convincing." She rubbed her eyes, "If we fail,
then Danner's suicide was for nothing." 

"It was the only way to get you in here once Prospero was ready, we
all knew that. Danner believed in what we're doing." 

She raised a clenched fist. "Anarchist League."

I returned the gesture. "Anarchist League. OK, I'll give you a few
minutes' head start then come down to the lab. I've sent Abigail off to
arrange hospitality for a mythical Board delegation, so no-one should
see you <i>sans</i> coat. She's bound to tell Thurman and that will make
a test-run seem all the more plausible." 

Sara picked up the folder and adjusted her collar. She flashed a
smile, gave me a "Good luck" - and was gone before I had time to reply.


A bad case of the shakes swept over me as I sat there on my own.
Despite my professed solidarity with Sara, in reality there was no
alternative escape route for just myself. Corporate security were bound
to take an interest if I walked out of the department without Vecchio
and Parks. Even if I reached the helipad it was a twenty-minute flight
to Albuquerque, and I'd still be 'Donald Cain' when I got there. Like
Sara, my persona was a fabricated 'legend'; one good enough to rival
anything the intelligence community could come up with. Unfortunately
I'd need the help of League hackers to resurrect my true self, and
they'd hardly be willing to co-operate if I bailed-out now. 

I stood and went over to my wall safe which lay behind a signed
picture of the actor Damien Lewis - in his role as the double-agent
'Nicholas Brody'. A terrible conceit, I know, but one I'd been unable to
resist. As part of my departmental isolation strategy the computer
network backups were kept in my office rather than the communal vault,
meaning I had access to the complete details of Project Mote as of
midnight last night. Terabytes of information on a device that would fit
snugly in my jacket pocket. 

One last look around and I left my executive haven forever.

<p class = drop>The main lab always set my teeth on edge -
literally - it being something to do with free radicals emanating from
the Tesla array. Sara was at the communications console sporting a new,
pristine lab coat. She didn't look up as I entered. 

Thurman made an immediate bee-line for me, a quizzical look on his
face. I took his elbow and steered him to the side, keeping my voice
low. "So you've heard?" 

He adopted the same conspiratorial tone. "I have my sources.
Catering is on red alert and security are shitting themselves.
Apparently." 

"Pretty much. Central are being deliberately coy about who this
delegation consists of, but that in itself points to the presence of at
least one senior Board member." 

He wrung his hands. "But why now? We won't have anything to show
them, not for another three months at least." 

"And I think that's the problem. Look, Vecchio came to see me <i>in
person</i>, because if they pull the plug on us then security for this
site will be downgraded and he'll be out of a job. His take on things,
gleaned from his opposite number at Central, is that certain people are
very unhappy about our perceived lack of progress. <i>Very</i> unhappy,
indeed." 

Thurman glowered. "I bet it's that bastard Takeshi, he's been
against this project from the start." 

"I agree, which makes it vitally important we're able to show him
something spectacular, something that will really rub his nose in it, in
front of the other visitors." 

"What do you mean, 'something spectacular'? I'm warning you, it will
take at least three hours to set up the test apparatus for another
monkey run." 

I licked my lips. "I'll thinking more along the lines of a simulated
transmission, a loop-back." 

He winced. "Well, all the high-capacity relays are in place, I grant
you, but we haven't had power levels up above twenty-percent. Baxter
will have kittens if we break his shiny new reactor." 

I played my trump card. "Which means if it <i>is</i> going to fall
on its ass I'd rather it did so in front of <i>us</i>, not the
delegation." 

The chief scientist looked around the room. "None of the secondary
shielding in in place, apart from the actual transmission zone." 

"But the consoles are protected and that's all that matters. We run
with a skeleton team and put everyone else in the observation booth.
Yes?" 

"<i>Maybe</i>. How long do we have to put this together?"

"I was thinking there's no time like the present."

Thurman laughed. "Well, I can't fault your enthusiasm, Director, but
that's not how science works in the real world. You can't just throw a
few switches and hope for the best, not with the kind of high-energy
fields we're manipulating. The only reason I'm contemplating this at
<i>all</i> is the weeks of preparation that have already been put in.
Rushing things at this stage would be foolhardy at best, if not
downright irresponsible. The slightest miscalculation and our only
epitaph will be a cloud of vapour the size of Nebraska." 

"Well, you're right, Thurman, I'm not a scientist, I'm the Director
of Operations. That makes me part administrator, part politician and
part showman. Seeing as how you like old films I have a misquote for you
in return - 'no Buck Rogers, no bucks'. Meaning if we can't show the
delegation that the future is <i>now</i>, our continued funding is
highly questionable, at best." I squeezed his shoulder, "And no-one
wants a spectacular failure on their CV, Lionel, do they?" 

His face contorted in an agony of indecision and I could almost see
the angel and devil on his shoulders, arguing the toss. After a few
moments he swallowed and wiped his mouth. "The first sign of anything
amiss and I pull the plug." 

"Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Down here, you're in charge, I'm merely
the interested observer." 

He strode over to the master console with me trailing in his wake. I
saw him clench his fists so tight the knuckles went white before lifting
the headset and setting it in place. He tapped the microphone twice.
"Attention, attention. All operations personnel to their stations. All
non-essential staff to the observation booth. This will be a loop-back
transmission exercise at full power. Hansen, find a suitable test
subject with an organic component. I'm sorry to spring this upon you,
ladies and gentlemen, but I'm sure we're ready." 

I could see Baxter looking over, his mouth open, and gave him a
thumbs up. It took a minute of two for the redundant staff to seek
illusory safety
behind several inches of armoured
glass. Everyone knew that if anything did go seriously wrong it would
offer no more protection than a sheet of tissue paper. A lab stool
topped by a plant pot was placed on the transmission plate; a carnation
in full bloom, scavenged from Thurman's office. 

Thurman took several deep breaths. "I want a go, no-go from each
station. Transmission." 

"Go." That was Sara and, in this context, entirely superfluous.

"Environmental."

"Go."

"Photonic."

"Go'"

"Tesla."

Nothing. I felt a twist in my gut. Thurman stared at Baxter.

"<i>Tesla.</i>"

Baxter closed his eyes. "Go."

Thurman unlocked the Perspex guard and placed his hand over the
'Abort' button. "We have a 'go' for transmission sequence. Tesla,
initiate cascade." 

I watched as the repeater dials displayed the slow increase of
power. The coils of the Tesla array began to glow; dark-blue, light-blue
then near white. My teeth began to itch and I was seized by a
near-uncontrollable urge to laugh out loud. 

We reached operational power. I leaned in close. "Charge the
capacitors." 

Thurman looked round, dislodging a drop of sweat from the tip of his
nose. "What?" 

"Charge the capacitors. Everything has to work in front of Takashi,
<i>everything</i>." 

He blinked, then nodded. "Tesla, initiate power buffering."

The huge ceramic 'waistcoat' - for want of a better description -
surrounding the transmitter began to pulse with blue light, accompanied
by a low-frequency throbbing. 

The chief scientist looked over at Sara. "Transmission, establish
link to reception station." 

Her fingers danced over the keyboard, following protocol even though
the Horst target site in South Dakota was oblivious to our test. A
synthesised female voice issued from the console speaker. <i>"Searching
for long-range comms. Searching for long-range comms. Signal failure on
long-range comms." </i> 

I smiled encouragingly at Thurman. "You do it. Initiate the burst.
You deserve to be the one who does this." 

He nodded, almost to himself. "Photonic, master console will
initiate burst protocol. Transfer control to my station." A panel lit
up. Thurman's hand shook as he reached over and pressed the twin trigger
buttons. 

A synthesised male voice spoke. <i>"Photonic burst transmission in.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. Initiate."</i> 

The area of space inferred by the compression grid flared into a
perfect reflective sphere, then winked out of existence. A ruby-red
laser fired from top-to-bottom, sweeping away our pseudo-photon. 

The universe paused for three-point-two seconds.

With no external communication channel the fail-safe kept our beam
of light within prismatic containment and returned it to source. It was
like watching a giant bubble burst, only in reverse. The silver sphere
formed, vanished, leaving&#8230; 

A carnation in full bloom, sitting on a lab stool.

Ragged cheering came from the observation booth. Thurman's shoulders
sagged and I let out a breath I hadn't realised I was holding. I slapped
him on the shoulder. "Well <i>done</i>, Lionel. Well done, indeed.
History will remember this moment, and your place in it." 

He gave me a hesitant smile which grew broader as the enormity of
our achievement sank in. "It worked, the fucking thing actually worked!
God, Donald, do you realise what this means?" 

"Oh, more than you can possibly know. Now, go and congratulate the
other members of your team. The day belongs to all of you." 

Thurman dropped his headset on the console and strode over to where
Baxter stood, visibly shaking. The other personnel spilled out into the
lab like pupils escaping school on the last day of term. Both lab stool
and carnation were held aloft in triumph. Only Sara and I stood apart
from the euphoric huddle. I locked the 'Abort' guard in place and
removed the key. She looked over at me. I nodded. 

Again Sara's fingers danced over the keyboard. Her singular talent
was the ability to memorise a 1,024 alphanumeric encryption key required
for synchronisation between sending and receiving stations. But this was
our key, our friends out there, waiting. 

"<i>Searching for long-range comms. Searching for long-range comms.
Signal lock for long-range comms established."</i> 

I reached for the twin trigger buttons.

<i>"Photonic burst transmission in."</i>

Sara and I stepped from behind our respective consoles and ran
towards the compression grid. 

<i>"Five."</i>

A siren began to wail as Baxter SCRAMed the reactor - but there was
enough residual energy in the capacitors for another burst. My sole
contribution to the design process. 

<i>" Four."</i>

<i>Prospero's Books</i> was an orbital data haven beyond
corporate
control. By the time a trans-jurisdictional injunction was served the
information I was carrying would be on a thousand illegal download sites
around the globe. 

<i>" Three."</i>

Or Sara and I would be dead.

<i>" Two."</i>

We were open-source Anarchists, high-tech Libertarians. Unrestricted
teleportation of people and goods would smash the world-state forever.
Realising that technology was worth any risk, any sacrifice. 

<i>" One."</i>

The air around us burned like hoarfrost. Sara screamed, or perhaps
it was me. 

<i>" Zero."</i>

I took her outstretched hand and together we leapt onto the
transmission plate. 

<i>"Initiate."</i>

God blinked, wiping a speck of dust from his eye.

And when he looked again, we were gone.

[*BLURB] Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a
dog it's too dark to read. <br><small>Groucho Marx</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">
“Bring me home,” Ronnie whispered through gritted teeth. “Bring me home,
thasa girl.”
   
Bonita growled, her own teeth buried in the jacket sleeve of his free
arm, gripping hard as she scrambled backward, pulling him across the
broken pavement.

Ronnie tried to think past the pain, which wasn’t in his leg, oh no, not
by a shot. It wasn’t even where his jacket had shucked up under his chin
and	rubbed the front of his neck raw. No, the pain was in his head. All
in his mind.

Pain, what’s pain? It’s nothing, pain. You just have to stop thinking
and its gone. Just silence those thoughts and wait for it to melt away.
But never forget your destination, and keep your grip on the prize.

That most of all he must not let slip away.

His fingers tightened on the strap of the dead scavenger’s backpack,
dragging it across the rubble exactly the way Bonita was dragging him. A
treasure
trove full of military grade vac-packed Tac-Snacks, the very one
championed by the survivalist-porn ad campaigns that ran right up until
the Great
Yellowstone Blow Off finally distributed Wyoming, Montana and Idaho
directly into the global atmosphere and put an end to broadcast media.

“It’ll be… good eating tonight, girl,” he muttered.

Bonita growled, nipping his forearm through his sleeve. A reprimand for
being so talkative while they were exposed out here in the deserted,
dust-shrouded
badlands of central Birmingham. He tightened his grip on her collar and
tried to keep his mouth shut.

The backpack banged into his left knee, and it seemed that the pain in
his right knee eased sympathetically. A flicker of optimism blossomed.
Perhaps he
had released himself from pain’s grip by focusing on its mirror-point
for a moment. Perhaps thoughtlessness wasn’t the key after all. Perhaps
he was
unlocking marvellous healing energies with his mind.

But then Bonita pulled him over the curb and onto the road, and as
Ronnie’s arse dropped, his legs slapped flat against the concrete
paving. Pain swept out
of his ruined knee and, instead of only feeling like he’d been shot, it
was as if someone had dropped a nuke into the wound, red radiating into
orange into
yellow into a blinding white.

Ronnie passed out before he could scream.

<p class=drop>In her simple way, the dog was relieved when the man lost
consciousness.
It stopped his grunting, his twisting and groaning, his constant
whispered
encouragement. That meant her chances of getting them back to the nest
unnoticed by predators were a little higher.

She backed away, paws scrambling, teeth sunk into the sleeve of his
jacket as she dragged him, but his slack fingers slipped out of her
collar and so she
paused for a better grip, biting down on his arm through the leather.

His hand dangled at the wrist, pale from lack of blood. It waved above
his head like he waved to her, as if he was pleased to see the sky.

The sky, a carpet of brown thunderheads, unbroken for half her lifetime.
Growing darker now. Night would soon fall. She had to get them back.

Her mind was on the pups.

<p class=drop>When Ronnie came around it was night and they weren’t
moving. His arms
ached in different directions, like a ballerina holding a pose long
beyond her
tolerance.

He couldn’t feel his hand, tried to move it, finally lifted his arm from
the shoulder, up off the ground like a falling tree played backwards.
Before the
near black of the clouds, the void-shape of his fingers twitched and he
sighed, dropped the arm beside him as the blood began to flow, tingling,
intoxicating the ache.

Then he realised both his hands were empty.

With a grunt of dismay he struggled to raise his head, craning to
see--and there was the backpack, thank god. Just beyond his reach, but
there.

Bonita stood beside it, looking at him.

“Good girl, Bonita,” he said, just a dry throated croak, but too loud.
She flinched and <em>ruffed</em> at him in low warning. “Okay,” he
whispered,
“you’re right, you’re right.” With absolute darkness descending upon
them, only sound might bring other scavengers down on them.

He’d never been a dog person, back in the good old world, but when
Bonita came into his life in the horrible new one, she’d been a
blessing--hunting down
rats and sharing them with him, not to mention an early warning system
for the sort of rats that sneak up and cut your throat in your sleep.

He’d been devastated when, a year ago, she somehow got out of the cage
he made to keep her. When it turned out she got knocked up by some lucky
mutt and
came back with a swelling belly he’d been pissed. Despite her usefulness
he’d wondered what he was doing, feeding a pregnant dog on half his
scrounge--but
when her little mongrels popped out, one by one, he knew it’d been the
right decision.

Thirteen little lives.

Including the two stillborns.

<p class=drop>Bonita put her nose into the pack. She’d got it open
somehow, clever
bitch that she was, but he could see from a mangled Tac-Snack lying by
his hand that
she was having less luck getting the plasti-tinfoil wrappers open.

He finger-walked the Tac-Snack into his palm, pulled the seal with
clumsy numb hands, then watery, nutrient-rich sauce was running over his
cracked lips
and he groaned, sucking out a few of the chewy, meaty, spongy chunks.
Mouth full, he tore the package wide enough for Bonita and held it out.

She snatched it, jerking her head to slop the rest of its contents down
her throat. It was empty too soon.

“That’s your lot,” he said, but one wasn’t enough, not for either of
them.

“Bring,” he ordered, flicking his fingers. She licked her chops, then
hooked the strap over her jaw and dragged it close enough for him to
grab. Clever
bitch indeed.

He pulled the pack onto his chest, counting the remaining packs by
touch. Maybe forty meals, but he’d have make them last. Make them a
reward. One for him,
another for Bonita and the pups. The eight that lived to open their eyes
had always been hungry.

Too hungry, really. But weren’t they all?

Ronnie knew that Bonita knew he only did what needed to be done, when he
took those poor little stillborn bodies away and came back with scraps
of meat for
them to share. He’d petted her afterwards, curled around her for warmth,
the pups nestled against her belly, where he could rest a comforting
hand amongst
them.

All those hungry mouths were so many, though, too many for her to
sustain and not wither away herself. He couldn’t let that happen to his
only companion.

A gentle, persistent squeeze in the night was all it took to provide
food for another day, and there would be more milk for the others.

They’d all grow stronger for it. It was for the best.

Yeah, she’d understood.

<p class=drop>“Home, Bonita,” he said, when she’d finished licking the
Tac-Snack
wrapper clean, pushing it through the dirt with her whole muzzle stuffed
inside.

He swapped arms, clutching the backpack to his belly with the right and
holding his left above his head for her to grip. He braced himself,
winced when her
teeth nipped him through the sleeve, and wondered if he had been better
before. His other hand was still tingly-dead so it would hurt less, but
at least
with this one could grip her collar properly.

Bonita took the strain, digging her paws in, and--like the train of
carriages jerking into motion one by one behind the locomotive--his
shoulders, back,
backside and legs began to grind over the ground.
He hissed out a breath as his knee began to glow, a nauseous throb
sensitive to the slightest motion. Bonita growled into his arm in warning,
but she didn't stop. He wondered, distracting himself from
the needling haze, how far they were from their nest. The last five
waiting pups. The
chance to bandage himself up and finally rest.

He didn’t notice as, beneath his still numb arm, the backpack began to
slide off his body--not until its end began to drag on the tarmac,
pulling itself
down his belly.

He grunted, scrabbled blindly for the straps, tried to wind them around
his arm.

“Bonita, stop,” he whispered. She didn’t.

It dragged down his right flank, heavy on his hip, his useless sausage
fingers unable to prevent the straps slipping away.

“Stop girl!” he ordered. She growled.

It bumped beside his right thigh, mere shrinking inches from the
wreckage of his knee. In desperation he let go of her collar, but she
fought to keep her
grip on his left arm, prevented him from reaching down with it to--

The backpack jounced his knee.

His leg erupted.

Ronnie wailed, his whole body thrashing, knocking the backpack aside. It
rolled away, one turn, another, as reached futilely for his leg,
hovering his free
hand, afraid to touch it.

Bonita dragged him backward again and this time he howled. She let go
with a bark--he’d never heard it before--and jumped back, teeth bared,
but Ronnie
wept with relief, humming to himself as the fire slowly, slowly ebbed.

She came close and pulled at his arm, but he shrugged her away. She
tried more forcefully, and accidentally bit beneath the cuff of his
sleeve, breaking
the skin of his wrist. Ronnie yelped and slapped her away, only then
seeing where the invaluable backpack had rolled to--just beyond his
reach.

“Bring, Bonita,” he said, voice low and hitching. “Bring the pack, let’s
go.”

She came to stand by his side, nuzzled her face into his jaw. “Okay,
girl, okay, but let’s get home,” he said, and rubbed her fur. She licked
his face, the
sweat that pain had squeezed out of him, and he pushed her towards the
pack.

“Bring the food, Bonita,” he ordered, raising his voice once more.

But she didn’t.

Instead her jaws closed on Ronnie again--gripping his throat.

Cutting off his voice, his breathing, his blood.

<p class=drop>After the man’s struggles stopped, the dog looked at the
backpack for a
moment.

The memory of the food it contained was still fresh. So too was the
memory of the shiny, tasteless skin that she had been unable to get into
without his
clever hands.

Then she bit into a slack arm and resumed dragging them towards the
nest.

Many meals for her pups. Those that still lived.

She’d understood.

[*BLURB] There is nothing new under the sun but there are lots of old
things we don't know.<br><small>Ambrose Bierce</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"Don't feel too bad, Doctor Alvarez. It's
not the first time we've seen that reaction."

"I just didn't
see this advance coming," Alberto Alvarez said, shaking his head with
something approaching despair. Harriet Bali offered him a sympathetic
smile. 

"When they thought technology would get bigger-instead, it went micro.
When it was thought we'd be working less hours, enjoying more leisure
hours-the opposite occurred. Overpopulating the Earth-and we hit a
crisis in the birth-rate and increased incidence of male impotency." 

The last made Alberto shiver with unease, and he saw Harriet lower her
head to hide a smile. 

"Doctor Alvarez. Please. We really appreciate your presence here.
Without it, we'd still be fighting for official recognition and
acceptance of what we've achieved. We're hoping that, with your
collaboration, we can maximise the potential of the Stargaze Process." 

Alberto shook himself.
He nodded. 

"Of course. I'm sorry. And, let me also say I'm honoured to be invited
here to witness the process in action. I know the
media, the movies, would have scientists always pooh-poohing any new
breakthrough that wasn't their own, but it's not always like that. Those
that take to badmouthing others' achievements are invariably those who
are trying to defend their own previously-announced discoveries. The
rest of us still remember what it's like to love the field we've chosen
to work in. We get just as excited as anyone, therefore, when there's a
major breakthrough." 

The Stargaze Process easily qualified in the 'major breakthrough'
category. It had broken through more than just scientific boundaries-it
had broken through the confines of their own known universe. And beyond.


In layman's terms: why leap into a
rocket and travel to the stars, when you could send your eyes to distant
galaxies from the confines of your own living room in order to
experience it for you? 

Of course, it was rather more complex
than just packaging your senses and posting them into the heavens. And
for 'living room', read the 'Stargaze Main Projects Room'. 

When
you delved deeper into the science of it all, you found the only thing
that was truly simple was the rather crass-but infinitely sellable-name
they'd given the whole endeavour: <i>Stargaze.</i> The marketing boys
and girls had clearly been sitting in on the meeting <i>that</i> day.

 
<p class=drop>"Here," Harriet said. "We nicknamed
the part that's positioned in front of the gazer's face <i>'the silver
carrot'</i>. Due solely to its shape, I assure you." 

"Quite,"
Alberto said, craning round to observe where the thicker end of the
carrot would slide forward to cover the subject's face. The carrot was
hollow and horizontal, so you could look straight down its reducing
cone. "It seems much longer than it really is when you look at it on the
inside." It had a corkscrew rib, running like the bore on the barrel of
a rifle. "Quite the optical illusion. Mirrors?" 

"Kind of,"
Harriet said with a smile. "It's to encourage the mind to reach further.
As the carrot turns, the senses are drawn out. Like drawing silk from a
silk worm without, in the process, killing the worm." 

"But
nothing is actually 'removed'?" 

"No. It's merely to help the
senses to stretch. Picture it like standing on a hilltop on a perfectly
clear day and letting your ears reach out and focus in order to hear the
sound of a car horn in a city a hundred kilometres away." 

He
smiled back. "Hardly the same, I imagine." 

"Hah! No, I'm afraid
that image is rather prosaic rather than accurate on two counts.
Firstly, there's no sense of sounds reaching the ear-rather the ear
going in search of them. The other is the distances involved. For a
hundred kilometres read&#8230; well, <i>'considerably further'</i>.
Would you care to take the seat and try it for yourself?" 

"That's why I'm here," Alberto said. But getting into the chair was more
awkward than it looked. His frame was accustomed to being hunched over a
keyboard rather than contorting to fit what resembled a kind of cockpit.


Apt, considering the distance part of him was due to travel.


"There you go. Just slide down until the back of your neck
feels the padded rim." 

"I feel like I'm about to have a
haircut," Alberto said shakily. 

"You're not the first to draw
that comparison. The chair's quite comfortable when you get into place.
And when the process starts, you won't be aware of it at all." 

"You've tried it?" 

"Just try stopping me!" Harriet said, her
smile peeling her lips back to reveal a healthy set of gums too. "Who
doesn't want to throw their mind out into space, see what's out there?
Starting with the stars we see in our night sky, and then beyond even
them? Currently, we have no idea just how far the Process might let us
see." 

"It's curious. I mean: all that stuff about remote
viewing, out of body experiences? I'm told it's not like any of that."


"The Russians ran programs in the Cold War to test
extra-sensory abilities. Hitler had his scientists looking into the
occult. The Americans had Oppenheimer. Teflon came about because of the
space program. Science is forever a weird and wonderful innovator." They
shared a smile. 

Although Harriet had been charged with
personally showing Alberto around, it was clear she shared his love of
the new and admired those daring to not just ask but <i>see</i> if it
were possible. 

Well, with the possible exception of Hitler and
Stalin, the megalomaniac sadists. 

"Okay?" Harriet asked and
Alberto nodded. She turned and raised a hand to someone the other side
of the one-way mirror behind them. "They're going to start the Process
now, Doctor Alvarez. Just look straight forward. You don't need to focus
on anything--your senses will adapt automatically. In turns out our
senses were equipped with this ability all along. We've always suspected
they were once far more potent or had hidden depths we simply stopped
using or forgot how to tap into&#8230; Stargaze merely facilitates their
release, as it were." 

As the silver carrot slowly began to
turn, Alberto chuckled. 

"Excuse me for saying so, but this
reminds me of some mind-control apparatus, or the torture device, used
in some old spy film. James Bond was it? Back when Sean Connery or Roger
Moore was still playing the part?" 

"You're wondering if it
could all just be a form of hypnotism? That's understandable. The mind
can play funny tricks, even on itself. Think of all those convinced they
were Cleopatra in a past life due to regression therapy. I can assure
you, though, you'll be able to tell the difference. Once you feel it
start to happen, you'll know it's genuine. 

"You'll be in
control at all times. The initial 'pulling' part of the process is only
to ease your senses out to a state where they might reach further. At
first, you'll feel the momentum build, like your senses are pressing
behind your eyes-then they'll just snake out as easy as party streamers
from a compressed gas canister." 

"And when I want to come
back?" 

"Like I said: you're in control. Don't worry if the
first time the sensation gets the better of you and you snap back quite
quickly-it's quite unnerving and it can take time to build up confidence
to let it all just happen naturally. If you're worried you won't know
<i>how</i> to pull yourself back, then don't: various instruments are
monitoring your heartbeat, breathing, brain activity&#8230; If we see
anything at all to alert us that the experience is anything but
pleasant, and we'll bring you straight back." 

"How?"
 
 She tapped the carrot. <i>"'What's up doc?'</i>" she said in a passable
Bugs Bunny voice. "Just like a fairground ride: we'll stop it spinning."
Alberto laughed at her impersonation and settled back down again. 

He had expected the effect to build slowly, almost like the thing
was drilling a steady hole through a thickly-reinforced wall. But it
happened quickly. And so smoothly, Alberto realised at once that
Harriet's assertion had been true: this was a natural ability they all
possessed. Like a baby thrown into a swimming pool instinctively opened
its eyes, held its breath&#8230;and then <i>swam.</i> 

Alberto
swam forward. 

At least, his senses did. Momentarily, it felt as
if his eyes were bulging, suddenly full of liquid before they oozed out
of his sockets in long, horizontal flagella whose ends flowered and
burst and then were pulled forward, still somehow connected to his
optical nerves, to the part of his brain where all this information was
processed. 

They rushed down the endless silver funnel and then,
wonderfully, his vision exited the carrot as if it had been nothing more
than a barrel to shoot his eyes out. 

He found himself far above
his own planet. 

<i>Already?</i> How could he have leapt so far
already? He had only just been stretching to the tip of that carrot, and
that was barely a metre and a half long. Maybe two, if he'd actually
taken the effort to measure it and examine the schematics before taking
his seat. Surprising him further, his mind had accompanied them rather
than just waiting for the filmed information to be transmitted back to
it. 

He looked down and saw what Armstrong, Aldrin and others
had marvelled at. It was a familiar image to anyone who'd ever picked up
a book on astronomy. But, just like seeing an animal in the flesh
compared to seeing one on a postcard, the real thing was an entirely
different experience. And the animal analogy wasn't an erroneous one:
that planet, that incredible sculpture of blues and greens and whites,
was a living thing. 

It gave one an understanding, a humbling
appreciation of what Earth truly was. Gave you cause to believe in the
miraculous once again. 

The vision fed his senses and he
acknowledged that more than his eyes were out here to process what he
witnessed. And that a living thing always recognised another that shared
its miracle of existence. 

<i> Always.</i>

<p class=drop><i>"Doctor Alvarez?"</i> The rapping on the
door was a mixture of knuckle and the soft flesh that peaked below the
little finger when you made a fist. It came again, the rhythm choosing
to become that deliberate pounding you got with a bad hangover. 

<i>The baddest hangover of them all.</i> 

<i> "Doc. Tor. Al. Va.
Rez. It's me. Harriet Bali. Please. I only want to talk to you. Doctor
Alvarez?" </i> 

Alberto hurried over and crouched down to
replace the black-sock draught-excluders he'd placed along the bottom of
the door and which Harriet's enthusiastic banging had dislodged. It
wasn't to keep breezes out. Nor in. It was to reduce the light. The
curtains had been drawn, pinned, then covered by blankets looped over
the curtain-rails and held in place with pegs and duct-tape. But even
with his shades on it was still too bright. 

Too
<i>illuminated.</i> 

<i>"Doctor Alvarez-I got the key from the
janitor. I'm sorry, Doctor Alvarez, but everyone's extremely worried
about you. I persuaded them to let me come alone. To talk to you. So I
could assure them you were alright." </i> 

"Nooooo!" Alberto
moaned when he realised what she intended and turned so he sat with his
back to the door. 

<i>"Alberto. Listen to me: if I can't tell
them you're okay, they'll send others here. Those others will very
likely take you away with them. They'll ask you questions and won't let
you go home until you've answered them." </i> 

There was a pause
and he heard her swallow, pictured her collecting herself. 

<i>"Doctor Alvarez-if they think you're sick, then they maybe won't let
you
go home again afterwards. Do you understand? After the way you ran
off&#8230;without saying anything&#8230; People need answers, Doctor
Alvarez. There's a lot riding on this. You were the official witness to
what Stargaze is trying to do." </i> 

"I don't want to!" He
craned his neck round to scream it at the door. "I don't want to! You
can't make me!" 

<i>"You have no choice, Doctor."</i> He heard
the sigh in her voice. The exasperation. He looked at how his hands
trembled. Even in the darkness they seemed to displace the air in black
waves. 

"If I talk to you? You'll tell them? You'll tell them to
leave me alone?" 

<i> "If you tell me what we need to
know&#8230; Then I promise you, I'll do all I can." </i> 

"You
promise?" 

<i>"All I can,"</i> she confirmed.
 
He rolled
away from the door and got to his feet. He was wearing his dressing gown
over a thick jumper, baggy green corduroys, three pairs of socks on his
feet. On his head was the brown felt hat with earflaps he wore when he
went fishing. The sunglasses were wide, wraparound ones, bought for an
aborted skiing holiday fifteen years ago. 

He was glad he'd
never gone. He never wanted to even <i>think</i> about being up so high
again. 

"I'm opening the door," he told her. "Get ready." He
opened it a crack, pulling his head back like he was avoiding the
searing heat from a partially opened oven. "Quickly. Get in. Quickly."


The sight he must have been. The way he'd barricaded himself in
here. It was understandable when Harriet hesitated. But as he became
frantic, as he made it look like the door would be closed again, she
nodded, and squeezed through the gap. 

He shut the door after
her, stuck black masking tape back down the seam and worked it into the
crack, then kicked the black sausages over the gap at the bottom of the
door. 

"It's too dark," Harriet said. "I can't see you."

"Your eyes will adjust&#8230;" It was just one of the many things
your eyes kept secret from you that they could do. "You'll get used to
it." 

"Maybe my sense of sight, but not my sense of smell," she
muttered, not quiet enough to avoid him hearing it. There was obviously
plenty of annoyance burning away inside Harriet Bali for the predicament
he'd placed her in when he'd woken from his stargaze, ripped himself
from the chair, and then ran out the building like his hair was on fire
and with nothing available to dowse the flames. 

"You want a
drink?" he asked. 

"No. Just an explanation."
 
"You can
sit down." 

"Where?"
 
"There's a chair behind you. It's
okay, there's nothing in it. It may smell a bit stuffy in here, but
everything's clean, I assure you." 

"Okay." He watched her swing
a hand about until it bounced off the arm of the chair and then felt her
way round to its seat. "Can't we just have a <i>bit</i> of light? Not
even a candle's worth?" 

"No."
 
"Is it because of what
happened? We tested the machine after you'd sat in it and it hadn't
malfunctioned. No one else has had a bad reaction when using it. Are you
sure you weren't suffering from some condition before you came to see
us?" 

In three quick sentences, she'd run the entire gambit of
corporate arse-covering. 

"The equipment worked just fine. That
wasn't it." 

"I'm relieved to hear you say that, Doctor Alvarez.
It would have been a lot better for us, though, had you stayed around
long enough to say that to our Board. Or responded to their frequent
requests for an explanation since. You're a scientist--" 

"Am
I?" he asked her. "Are any of us what we really think we are?" The
silence that came after indicated this wasn't the type of question
Harriet was capable of answering. Nor the type she had come here to
ponder with him. 

"Then I'm supposing it's something you saw on
your travels?" 

"Yes. Yes, that's it exactly."
 
"Space
is a vast, unexplored area. And we're the pioneers. I warned you it
could be disorientating. What exactly did you see?" 

"Life." A
simple word, but the most potent in all galaxies. The biggest miracle of
them all. The one that made a supernova nothing more than a flaring
matchhead. 

"But that's every scientist's dream, Doctor Alvarez!
My God! I mean, we traced your route afterwards, but we never
thought&#8230;" 

"What? What did you say? Traced my..? No one
told me that you could find out where we went?" 

"Well, the
tracing process takes time. We can't just follow you by pointing one of
ourselves in your direction. There are a billion tiny alternations in an
individual's chosen route that could throw us into another galaxy
entirely. But the computer records your movements, plots a path, as it
were, so we can do it that way. We're not just pioneers, but
cartographers." 

"But no one's gone where I went?" he asked
frantically, both hands curling fingers over an invisible bar set before
him. 

"Not yet. But&#8230;<i>Life?</i> If that's what you saw,
we have no choice but to investigate it, do we? It's the Holy Grail of
space travel." 

"You mustn't!" Her saw her wince at the volume
of his voice. "Don't you see? You simply mustn't!" 

"Doctor
Alvarez. I, we've, been patient with you. But wailing words of doom
isn't going to cut much with us. We're scientists. So, please, give me a
reason to think <i>you're</i> still capable of thinking like one too."


"Okay, okay. Yes." He looked towards the door, seeing neither
escape nor sanctuary. There were no doors. No boundaries, anymore. And
as for windows&#8230; "I'll tell you. But you must believe me. And
then&#8230;then you must stop them from trying. They mustn't go there.
It could ruin everything. For everyone." 

"I'm listening."

"I went. Out there. It was just like you said it would be. I looked
down on the Earth and it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
Then I turned away and went further. I didn't have the sensation I was
choosing a direction as such, just that I felt some urge to go towards
one particular star. There was nothing about it that was remarkable. If
anything, it was dimmer, more distant than others more immediately
approachable. But for some reason I was attracted to it. 

"I
<i>hurried</i> there. I passed through vast amounts of space and in so
doing I passed through a similar quantity of time. I didn't move
backwards and forwards in time, I merely mean that for such vast
distances to be travelled, time has to be bent the same way light is
influence by the effects of gravity. 

"I couldn't pull up from
my trajectory even had I wanted to. I certainly couldn't alter my path.
I was going to see what was on the principal planet orbiting that star,
like it or not. 

"Because it wasn't me flying my senses out
there. It was something else&#8230;something that was pulling me in."

<p class=drop>"You mean this, whatever it was, had
caught you, or that it was attracting you in some way?" 

He saw
Harriet was holding back from expressing outright scepticism. The
Stargaze Process was new, so how could they discount anything until they
knew the full scope of its possibilities and what might actually be out
there? 

"I mean&#8230;" He didn't complete his sentence.
Instead, he changed scenes in the story, switching to another memory
camera, as it were. "I came in closer and closer and the planet grew
more distinct as I descended. It was green in places-but emerald, not
the softer greens of Earth. And the seas were a darker, shinier blue. It
was as if the planet were wrapped in different coloured foils. There
were silver patches too: irregular and without pattern. 

"But
when I was close enough, the silver tarnished to a light grey. Like the
shading of a graphite pencil? It still glinted in places but was not
metallic--but like shells. Because that's what they turned out to be.


"Down I went. Down, down. I thought I was going to crash into
that mass of grey shingle, but that would have made a nonsense out of
what I was whilst I was travelling in that realm. As you told me: I was
nothing but a satellite of sorts from my own mind. So I slowed, braking
hard-but as with all that happens with your process, it was a smooth
sensation of deceleration. 

"And then I was amongst them.

"Their shells wore whirls like on the outside of a snail's shell.
But these shells were also far more rounded, larger too-each about the
size of a beach ball. They were mottled, tortoiseshell, each marked
differently but cast from the same basic design, but limited by the same
limited choice of colours. And from each shell extended a soft-limbed
creature like a sea anemone, or a snail that had sprouted many tentacles
or antennae rather than just the customary two. The creatures were a
light orange, with green threads running through them which I don't
think carried blood but were instead flows of nutrients from the
pale-green mossy plant-life they were grazing upon. 

"The
tentacles quivered in the air, not feeling for me, but rather for each
other and that fuzz they fed upon. They were blind in our terms of
sight, and as I looked around I saw that only those nearest me were
moving. The rest of them were still, but the shells not dull, but shiny,
filled with living creatures as they were. 

"Those others seemed
to be sleeping. 

"There was one though that had turned towards
me. <i>Sensed</i> me. I knew it was the one that had drawn me here and I
wanted to ask it why it had done so. How it had known of me, felt me out
there&#8230;" 

"You think it possessed some sensitivity of its
own?" Harriet suggested. "Or that it simply possessed the same talent
we've discovered in ourselves but that it didn't require some slowly
spinning silver carrot to achieve it?" 

"No." Alberto's denial
was short, sharp, adamant. "Because there is no 'talent' we possess. Not
the way you've all been thinking of it. That creature wasn't calling out
to me. That thing was bringing me back. It wasn't trying to communicate
with Doctor Alberto Alvarez. It <i>was</i> Doctor Alberto Alvarez. Or,
rather: I am a part of it. We're not the ones extending our thoughts out
there, Ms Bali. <i>They're</i> extending their thoughts, their senses
out <i>here</i>." 

"That's impossible!" Harriet said shaking her
head. "I mean, come on&#8230;" 

"I'm not saying we're just their
senses. Nor that we're just their dreams. We're living, breathing
creatures. We live, we die, just like any other living thing. But
haven't you ever wondered what it is <i>really</i> that sets us apart
from the other living creatures that share this planet with us? Not just
our superior intelligence-which has always been obvious-but why we do
things like imagine, create, argue over semantics and philosophy, and
concern ourselves with abstract concepts such as reason, justice, mercy?


"It's them. That part of us responsible for all that I've
mentioned isn't us. We're just the animal part. The monkey or tree shrew
we were further down the chain. Take away that different part<i>
they</i> provide, and we're just another version of our evolutionary
ancestors once more. If we have a soul at all, then it's the sensory
ability those things are projecting into us." 

"You're saying
we're slaves of snails?" Harriet asked, and despite her earlier attempts
to avoid stooping to such tactics, the sarcastic scepticism was now out
and having its voice. "Rubbish! That would mean they themselves had
directed us to make a machine which would, in turn, find them again!"


"I&#8230;I can't figure that bit," Alberto said, rubbing
vigorously at his temples as if something squirmed and chewed there. It
probably did at that. "Maybe we possess our own residual intelligence.
Maybe, over the years, we've grown capable of such thought in our own
right. I only know they're out there. That we're not really who we think
we are&#8230;" 

"Then why would you be talking to me about this
now? Why would you think it makes any difference if I'm just another
snail-person, controlled by a remote server?" 

"I'm not sure.
Maybe because they don't have the control over us they once did.
Scientists, maybe some people with greater mental abilities, or maybe
those who think too much on these types of things, might be getting free
of them. Maybe some of us can't be controlled the way we once were."


"<i>Some</i> of us?" Harriet asked. "No one else has had your
experience, Doctor Alvarez." 

"But they might do. I mean: if
they ride the Stargazer the way I did&#8230;" 

"On the other
hand, what you're suggesting would make the Stargaze Process the perfect
way to find out who had this peculiar talent of independence, of
defiance, don't you think?" 

Though he expected it to be there,
he realised any trace of sarcasm had gone. 

"Not 'some' having
such a unique capability, Doctor Alvarez," she told him. "Just one. We
had to be sure about you though." 

"No! You&#8230;I have to go.
To warn people!" 

"No, Doctor Alvarez. I'm afraid you're not
going anywhere. Not anymore." Harriet Bali smiled, slowly. At a snail's
pace. "<i>'Monkey and tree shrew'</i>, indeed&#8230;"

[*BLURB] Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in
creating out of void, but out of chaos. <br><small>Mary Shelley</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>At the insistence of a second arpeggio of
descending chimes Mosper Belk reluctantly put down his book and shuffled
into the front hall to peer closely at the wall-screen. It displayed in
his doorway the profiled image of an unfamiliar man clad in sombre grey,
apart from a jaunty emerald trim at collar and cuffs. He held a slim
black case. There was a relaxed dignity about his stance which betokened
someone serious and self-assured. Mosper had not been expecting any
weekend callers. Intrigued, he opened the door.

“Forgive
disturb, esteemed Belk”, the man announced gravely, with a respectful
nod. “Hulf Atacrast, day-journeyed from Meheric. Fore-message left at
place of work, but Mr Smirt of Greeming and er… Trelph?” 

“Trulph.” 

”Yes. He tells me they respect your rest-day.”

Mosper was not quite sure how to respond to this slightly
contradictory information, offering only a non-committal “Ah,” and
looking politely expectant. 

“Meheric Faculty Propulsion,” the
man clarified. “Since eleven years, Research Scrupulator.” He proffered
a holocard for inspection. It confirmed his identity, membership of the
faculty and significant academic credentials in the field of powered
flight theory. Atacrast explained that his was a consultative rôle,
shared with eight others, replacing what used to be known as the
Scrutinizing Committee. 

Mosper felt an unexpected pang of
nostalgia at this reminder of his own earlier career. “So we have a
common interest. I see you spent some time at the Wotzl Foundation. Even
here in Snoak it has a fine reputation for being at the forefront of
aeronautical development. The Institute in Meheric of course I used to
know well, though I doubt whether any of the people I worked with are
still there. One loses touch as the years pass… Now I content myself
with a bit of general tinkering. The fingers still need to be exercised,
as well as the mind.” He handed back the holocard. “But why have you
come to see me?” 

“Ah, venerable sir, with your permit, I
greatly wish discuss with you certain papers, by auspicious accident of
fortune retrieved from rodent nesting site in faculty archives.”
Atacrast tapped his document case. 

“The archives? But I thought
they were… Papers? What papers exactly?” 

“<i>‘Lighter, swifter,
safer: rethinking the airpod engine,’ ‘Dynamics of cloud control,’
‘Gyractive isolates and the quest for stability’</i>. Also others
similar,
authorship M Belk, S Corrity, S Crobes, R Hobharp, Senior Airtechs. In
humble opinion Atacrast, important historic work, for much time
ignored…” He lowered his voice confidentially. “I, Atacrast, believe
these documents not supplied for emergency comfort of mice by benevolent
action of caretaker, but with purpose suppressed! Suppressed by person
or people of ignorance or of malice to prevent advancement of
aeronautics.” 

Mosper looked momentarily astonished, then sighed
ruefully and gestured to his visitor. “Well, Scrupulator Atacrast, I
think you had better come in.” 

<p class=drop>Thirty five years earlier Mosper Belk, as a
newly-qualified airtech,
had joined what was then known as the Institute of Aeronautics in
Meheric. He remembered the frisson of anticipation as he was shown into
one of the engineering hangars to meet fellow members of the design
team. Straplene Corrity had trotted up briskly to welcome him, followed
by Rangent Hobharp, solidly muscular and grinning broadly, and lanky
Spacker Crobes. Soon they had gathered into an enthusiastic huddle to
decide which of their current projects would most suit Mosper’s level of
training. An unshaven middle-aged man who had been standing nearby
frowning at the ceiling wandered over, made as if to shake his hand, but
instead clapped him on the shoulder and nodded without speaking, before
heading out again. Mosper remembered thinking that the man’s clothes
looked as if they had been slept in. Spacker offhandedly informed him
that he had just met the Director himself, Cravian Drowl. 

Cravian Drowl: a man with an enviable reputation as a paragon of
probity, a level-headed problem-solver, a moderator of disputes, whose
competence was beyond question. He had worked hard over the years to
perfect this image. An only child of parents who lived in a state of
uneasy truce, his retentive memory and observational skills equipped him
with a sometimes startling ability to assess others’ states of mind
before anything had been communicated verbally. 

With a penchant
for figures, but as yet with no specific career in mind, Drowl had opted
to qualify in accountancy, while conscientiously cultivating the
techniques necessary to put people at their ease. This seemingly
effortless knack of inspiring trust allowed him in due course to advance
to positions in senior management. People of both sexes found they had
no reservations about confiding in him, although Drowl was vaguely
disappointed that none of these encounters was the prelude to the kind
of intimate relationship he had imagined. He chose not to dwell on those
brief fumblings with Witany Yargle which had left them both hot and
humiliated, and resolved to concentrate on work. At Snoak’s water
purification plant, in the absence of any opposition, he rose steadily
to become Operations Manager, a post he held for almost ten years before
beginning to feel a vague restlessness. Looking beyond his familiar
comfort zone, he happened to notice that there was a vacancy for the
Directorship of Meheric’s Aeronautic Institute, a position which came
with the additional benefit of self-contained furnished accommodation.
He suspected he did not have the full range of skills for the job, but
his interest was piqued. 

Of the four other candidates, all had
far higher levels of technical expertise than Cravian Drowl. Two had
worked on commercial pods, Den Flepter as flight engineer, Zoel Torison
as pilot. A third, Veiv Maufrig, had worked for many years abroad,
progressing from cargo-handler to Podport Chief of Security. The fourth
was Ko Prodovel, a specialist in micro-engineering. Her public profile
was of a well-groomed ambitious woman of formidable talents and
conspicuously expensive tastes. She was reputed to have been the brains
behind the success of the ParaPet organization, earning her (when safely
out of earshot) the dubiously respectful nickname of “Pokehead”. 


An unhappy series of events led to a shortening of the odds in
Drowl’s favour. In the week following the formal interviews Flepter had
been seriously injured in a snow-float accident on Mount Kyren. During a
routine dental appointment Torison was regrettably diagnosed as
suffering from the onset of Hiriffer’s Syndrome, a neuromuscular
affliction which gradually inhibits speech until the victim can utter
only fricatives. Then there was the report in the Quanderpyre Press,
“SNAFFLED BAGGAGE FUNDED PODPORT PERKS – SAYS EX-HEAD OF SEC’S SEXY EX”
in which one of Maufrig’s resentful former wives revealed that her
former husband had for years secretly conducted a lucrative sideline
selling confiscated goods. After questioning, Maufrig had been taken
into custody, pending further investigation. 

The Institute was
dependent on State funding, and its limited annual budget was allocated
at the Director’s discretion. It was partly his reputation for safe
economic management that tipped the balance towards Cravian Drowl over
the other remaining candidate, the more technically experienced if
allegedly extravagant “Pokehead” Prodovel. When interviewed, “Pokehead”
had been eager to explain how her expertise might be applied to aspects
of pod technology. She filled in the odd awkward silences with sharp
remarks about the cost of progress and the difficulties of private
enterprise, and made it clear that she knew how to knock a team into
shape. 

She was obviously fiercely energetic, highly capable and
somewhat intimidating. 

What sealed the decision was the
interviewers’ unanimous agreement that Drowl, despite being new to
aeronautics, was confident and motivated, and had the kind of reassuring
presence which boded well for the future smooth running of the
Institute. Each of them had felt that he had answered their questions
with a disarmingly honesty, and had no doubt that Drowl had the makings
of an excellent Director. Sadly, they were to be proved wrong. 

He moved from his north Snoak apartment with its view of the
deeply-shadowed shelving of the sandstone quarry into the comparative
luxury of a suite of furnished rooms in Meheric’s Institute. For the
first few years everything went reasonably well. His work at the water
purifying plant had accustomed Drowl to the basic principles of
engineering, and although he was not expected to equip himself with an
oily rag, a pair of calipers or a wrench, he soon familiarized himself
with the terminology of pod mechanics. He made a point of meeting and
chatting to the designers, assistant airtechs and ancillary staff,
acquainting himself with their functions and degrees of responsibility.
He assured them he was always open to new ideas, and that any concerns
or grievances would be treated sympathetically and in confidence. Those
he spoke to were left with the pleasurable feeling that their new
Director was someone with their best interests at heart. In Research and
Development, the creative hub where sustained funding was so crucial,
the mood among the airtech designers was almost celebratory. 

While Drowl was not averse to seeking informed advice, he positively
avoided having to delegate decision-making. He felt that letting others
operate on his behalf would somehow degrade the responsibilities of his
position. Consequently, every choice he made, whether relating to
finance, management or maintenance carried its niggling burden of
anxiety, which he strove to suppress. 

His secretary, a local
girl, seemed to be adept at prioritizing matters that required his
attention, and ensured that any documentation, once dealt with, was
appropriately filed away. 

As might be expected, the principal
conflict lay in staying within budget while keeping all departments of
the Institute functioning efficiently. From past records he could see
that R &amp; D was the potentially profitable area, but also the most
expensive to keep supplied with necessary hardware. Any restriction was
bound to affect the morale of its highly specialized team. He knew that
over time he would have to make economies, but they must be unobtrusive.
It was a difficult balance, but as Director, it was under his control.
He couldn’t afford to be seen to make mistakes. He dismissed the nagging
thought that he might be out of his depth. Insidiously, like a virulent
infection, the anxieties multiplied. 

Eventually even the most
commonplace problem began to bristle with unresolvable contingencies. In
his pursuit of economy he gradually cut back on renovation, postponed
repairs, finally dispensed with secretarial help. He cancelled meetings,
sat for hours in his office, checking and re-checking figures, doubting
the logic of his own reasoning, puzzling over investigative safety
reports or proposals for technical improvements as if they had been
written in a totally unfamiliar language. As time passed Drowl grew
steadily more withdrawn. Sometimes he neglected to eat, and his evident
lack of sleep caused him to look increasingly haggard. He would wander
absentmindedly into hangars and workshops, avoiding confrontation,
rarely mumbling more than a few words to anyone. The Institute continued
to function, driven by the established momentum of multiple
interdependent daily tasks, but the seeds of chaos had been sown. 


<p class=drop>“And so, Scrupulator Atacrast,” said Mosper Belk, “you
must
understand that we airtechs hardly ever saw Director Drowl, and for many
months had no idea that anything was amiss. We were skilled at
improvising when requisitioned items were temporarily unavailable, and
we had facilities for manufacturing our own precision tools, so work on
ongoing projects was scarcely affected. But we all assumed that our
research papers had been sent on, as was customary, to the State
Scrutinizing Committee, and copies duly stored in the Institute’s
files.” 

“Committee with response of elongated silence…”,
Atacrast suggested. 

Mosper smiled, a little ruefully. “Indeed,
a silence of such length that we made attempts to seek an explanation.
My colleagues and I went to see the Director. We had not known that by
then he no longer had a secretary, and were disconcerted to see the
disorganized state of his office. Boxes of documents were stacked on the
floor around his desk, and the surface of the desk itself was littered
with sheets of hand-written calculations amid the detritus of what
looked like abandoned meals. Drowl apologized for the mess, explained
that his secretary had left (he did not say why), and assured us that
there was no cause for alarm, matters were in hand, he would personally
see to it that the Committee would be made aware of our concerns.
Corrity and I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, although
Hobharp and Crobes suspected that for some unknown reason we were being
fobbed off.” 

Atacrast asked if he might have a glass of water,
but was readily persuaded by his host’s counter-offer of emberskelven,
the reddish-gold brew which was one of Snoak’s local attractions. 

“A week or so later,” Mosper resumed, “we went once again to Drowl’s
office, determined to extract satisfactory answers from the Director. He
was standing by the window, wearing his outdoor coat, staring out at the
rain. His face looked strained, with dark pouches under his eyes, and he
seemed to have some difficulty recognizing us. In contrast to our
previous visit the office was practically bare; the boxes had been
cleared away, and only a small pile of papers remained on the desk,
neatly trapped under a green onyx paperweight in the shape of a sleeping
dog. When we asked him about the lack of response to our research
papers, Drowl launched into a barely coherent explanation involving
budgetary requirements, regulatory constraints, regrettable economic
necessities, bureaucratic procedures and other such waffle. Then, with
an abrupt change of mood he evicted us from his office, muttering that
he needed to attend to an urgent personal matter. There was something so
dourly implacable about his attitude, the look in his eyes so desperate,
we were frankly too taken aback to raise a sensible objection. After
that it was too late.” 

“Too late?” prompted the Scrupulator.


“That was the last time anyone at the Institute ever saw or
heard from Cravian Drowl.” 

There was nothing of obvious
significance left in the Director’s office other than an ashy heap of
burned paper in the ceramic incinerazer. It was assumed that Drowl had
taken his paperweight with him. It was not found in his private rooms,
whose abandoned contents apparently offered no clue as to his possible
whereabouts. This posed a quandary for the investigative team, a trio of
burly detechs and a forensic specialist from Snoak Central, who had been
called in when the Director failed to return. 

The entire
workforce was questioned with discreet efficiency. The lately dismissed
secretary, the quietly dependable Seepy Trasset, had been duly traced to
her shared apartment above a bakery in Lower Meheric. She was persuaded
to overcome residual feelings of loyalty, and asked to describe anything
unusual about the Director’s behaviour in the weeks preceding her
dismissal. Seepy told how he had become strangely secretive about the
filing of paperwork, and prevented her accessing even material she had
previously handled. She confirmed that he had grown increasingly remote
and uncommunicative, and that while genuinely concerned about his health
she was actually more relieved than disappointed when he told her she
was no longer required. 

Mosper and his three colleagues had
been closely questioned, as Drowl’s last contacts in the Institute.
Further investigation revealed that the State Scrutinizing Committee had
received no research papers from the Institute for almost a year, and no
such documents were to be found either among the remaining
office files or in the Director’s apartment. 

It soon became
clear to the investigators that the missing man had almost certainly
been suffering from severe work-related stress. The Institute’s finances
were stretched to their limit. It was concluded that an obsessive fear
of overspending had led him to the irrational decision to ignore or
actively hold back any proposals that might entail further costs. In
Drowl’s mind the prospect of allowing the Scrutinizing Committee to
approve research papers, irrespective of any long-term benefits, would
have been fraught with disaster. It was therefore believed that the
papers, together with any filed copies had been destroyed, and that the
wretched Drowl, unable to face the consequences of his mismanagement,
had fled in a state of guilt and confusion. 

Mosper Belk blinked
away the unbidden moisture in his eyes as he gingerly examined the
papers that Hulf Atacrast had removed from his document case. They were
indeed the originals, complete with marginal notes in a neat hand he
knew to be his own. The individual pages had been carefully uncreased
and sheathed in transparent sleeves. The paper itself was slightly
yellowed and brittle, some corners and edges showing evidence of
desultory nibbling. The ink was still legible, but patchily faded and
stained. He had never expected to see again these distillations of so
many hours of focused thought and excited discussion with his fellow
airtechs; the long-lost repository of their combined inventiveness. 


“Meheric Faculty Propulsion now much changed, respected Belk. New
buildings, new people, some new ideas. Paper is dead, extinguished, like
the doodle. Now, all e-screens, haptic panels, telefacture,
self-correcting praxins, all manner advances since time of Drowl and his
sad misguidance.” 

“Drowl, who was never actually found,”
murmured Mosper, “despite supposed sightings in a dozen far-flung places
over the following years. We often wondered, with a mixture of
bitterness and well… pity, what really became of him.” 

Atacrast
shrugged and raised his hands, as if fending off an enormous balloon.
“Defaced utterly from Meheric Archive, perhaps for better. And now after
years you hold again valuable research deserving of proper credit, which
as Scrupulator I would be honoured to make possible.”

They sat
for a while in reflective silence, sipping at their emberskelven,
savouring its tang and listening to the faint hiss of crepitation.
Later, Hulf Atacrast insisted on marking the occasion with a meal at The
Cylinder in Gropp’s Market, prepared under the supervision of Tedor
Safra himself. Mosper Belk began to protest at this suggestion, but
Atacrast assured him that he had made an open reservation well in
advance, being both a gourmet and an optimist. Belk’s home in Prossing
Street was only a short walking distance from the restaurant, which he
had passed many times without really noticing the expensive delights
being consumed within. 

After the meal, the Scrupulator left to
catch the night-pod back to Meheric, while Mosper strolled back to his
house, glancing up from time to time at the swiftly winking beads of
micropods as they threaded the sky carrying their vital commerce. He had
heard them called “Pokehead Pods”, but had no idea why. He must remember
to ask one of his young friends at work. Sometimes he felt that the new
technology was leaving him behind.

[*ITEM] Madras Point

[*AUTHOR] Martin M. Clark

[*BLURB] No battle plan survives contact with the
enemy<br><small>Helmuth von Moltke</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">White-out.

We faced a whirlwind of powdered snow but my head-up display provided
both topographical overlay and passive infrared. Ahead of us lay frozen
lake, the
snow-covered shoreline, and some bare trees. Sergeant Lovell was on
point, receiving feedback from the frontrunner surveillance drones,
checking the ice
was thick enough to bear our weight. We were in full carapace rig plus
tactical weapons load - weighing in at a spit under 2000 pounds apiece.
Approaching
the enemy position at Madras Point across the lake certainly fell under
the heading of 'unexpected', but one false step and we'd end up as
permanent
residents.

The Sarge stopped and raised a fist. As one the other seven of us
halted, lapsing into 'ready' stance 3. Of course he could have simply
spoken to us over
the tight-band, but Lovell was strictly old-school when it came to
battlefield comms. Plus I knew he didn't buy the 'easy-in, easy-out'
mission profile
that Major Sondheim had been peddling.

The indentured workforce on Pendragon Minor had rioted, taking the
MidasCorp management hostage. Nobody had been seriously hurt but the new
'Workers'
Soviet' wanted a flat-rate wage increase and better living conditions,
or things would turn nasty. Someone in the corporate hierarchy wanted to
make a
point, so now eight over-armed Marines were going to overwhelm a bunch
of
ordinary Joes in the name of labour relations. Man, the cost of our
deployment
alone would have paid for everything the peons were demanding and then
some. Go figure.

Sargeant Lovell gestured and the squad echeloned left. I had my external
mic on even though the shrill wind made the suit interior feel chilly.
Call me
optimistic, but I figured the sound of cracking ice would give me enough
time to blow the rig apart and escape. I trusted the drone tech, but
only so far.

We maintained a steady pace; that loping, stylised gait you get with
powered armour. Even if someone <i>had</i> been looking in our direction
the mimetic
camo would turn us into a white-on-white blur amidst the snow swirls.
Anyway we'd been told the opposition had zero tech; a few pistols and
shotguns looted
from the Police barracks, but that was all.

The Sarge stopped, frozen in place.

As Corporal I halted the squad. Suit malfunctions were extremely rare
but not unknown. I half-smiled to myself; if the Sarge had to be evac'd
by a recovery
lifter then he'd tear someone in Maintenance a new one.

I spotted vapour condensing around the back of his helmet and upped my
display magnification. There was a small hole there; smooth, not jagged.
I'd never
known a suit go bad like that. A bunch of command icons appeared in my
peripheral vision. The ice ahead of me was now shown in shades of green.

New batter up.

I took a deep breath. "Squad, this is Cooper. The Sarge is down. I
repeat, the Sarge is down. Looks like a sniper, single-shot,
high-velocity. I'm in
command. Alpha team, stand fast. I want suppressive fire on the shore,
directly ahead, along the crest of the rise. Bravo team, with me.
Weapons free,
weapons free."

There was no back-chat, no queries. The Sarge was gone. You couldn't
triage a man in carapace; if command and control had devolved to me it
was because his
suit biometrics had tanked. The built-in medical systems would do what
they could, but for now it was all about dealing with the immediate
threat.

The three remaining members of Alpha adopted the 'brace' stance, raised
their weapons, and opened fire. We were all carrying miniguns - and not
the usual
squad support weapon but its 9mm big brother. Sustained fire turned
fifty metres of shoreline into a maelstrom of earth, snow and shattered
tree-trunks.

I led Bravo onward, aiming to reach the shore maybe a 100 metres left of
the target zone. Not that I thought flanking fire would be required but,
back
then, I did things by the book. The temptation to up the pace was almost
overwhelming but the drones could only move so fast.

The icon for McGuire - Alpha 2 - blinked red. My rig had defaulted to
full squad monitoring rather than the 'eyes only' approach favoured by
Sergeant
Lovell. A glance behind showed coolant burbling from McGuire's
breastplate and the spark of a ruptured power cell.

The ice ahead of me flared red.

"Bravo, halt!"

A figured it for a sub-surface thermal detonation, the result being a
band of paper-thin ice stretching in either direction as far as the
drones could
detect. I swore. "Jorgovic, Peters, suppressive fire, increase target
zone thirty meters left. Ingersoll, thickening fire-"

"I'm hit!"

Ingersoll's right arm drooped; vapour venting from a neat hole in the
shoulder plate. My remaining guys opened up, full auto, but we were
pissing in the
wind. The sniper had indirect eyes on us and was probably firing from
behind - and through - the snowbank directly ahead. We were targets in a
shooting
gallery, nothing more.

I knew when I was beat. "Lazy Gun Actual this is Lazy Gun Two, request
immediate fire support. Over."

Lieutenant Hawks came back straight at me. "Lazy Gun Two this is Actual.
Cooper? What the hell is happening out there?"

"The Sarge is down, L-T, same for McGuire and Ingersoll. Sniper fire.
Hyper-kinetic rounds that can punch clean through our rig. We have no
eyes, I repeat,
no eyes on the shooter. The ice ahead has been compromised and we cannot
close on his likely position." Falling back didn't occur to me.

"Jesus, Coop, thanks for spoiling my day. OK, what do you want?"

"I figure the bad guy is on the far-side of the ridge." I shouldered my
weapon and engaged the laser designator. "I need an area fire mission
centred
twenty, two-zero, metres from the transmitted co-ordinates, bearing
one-three-zero."

"Negative on the fire mission, Corporal, you know we've nothing in
orbit."

The icon for Edwards - Alpha 3 - blinked red. My first command was
turning to shit. I didn't feel afraid, or frustrated or even
disappointed - I didn't
feel anything at all. "Just lost Edwards. Gimme something, L-T, or none
of us are getting off the ice."

"Lazy Gun Two, wait one."

I felt like a spare wheel, standing there while the guys blazed away. A
100-metre stretch of shoreline was now shrouded in our man-made blizzard
but it was
obvious we were facing advanced tech, and then some.

"Bastard!" Peters stopped firing; the ammo feed to his weapon had been
severed. Exposed rounds dropped to the ice, covered in a tracery of blue
static
discharge.

"Lazy Gun Two this is Actual. Cooper, take cover. Midas-" the rest was
lost in a <i>scree</i> of electronic gibberish. All my long-range icons
went dark.

Take cover? There wasn't so much as a fucking reed sticking out of the
ice. "Squad! Squad, cease fire and hunker down. Whatever they got
coming, it's
coming now."

We dropped to one knee; 'at rest' stance 2. I doubted it would make much
difference.

White light.

My display flared out then slowly adjusted. Heavy polarisation turned
the world monochrome. We were just inside a huge circle of radiant
brilliance. It was
shrinking rapidly; concentrating, increasing in intensity.

Focusing.

<i>"Sweet Jesus." </i>
The beam narrowed to a searing column centred on a point just beyond the
ridge. I screwed my eyes shut even before visual shut down due to
overload. I
heard cries and curses from the other men.

The orbital ion cannon fired.

There was a moment of utter silence.

Then the shock wave roared over us; a banshee of pulverised snow and
earth. Ice rippled and cracked beneath my feet. I felt my boots slide
despite the
crampons. Visually I reached for the 'Eject' icon and if the Sarge had
still been in command I might have considered it. As it was I couldn't
just bail and
dump this shit on someone else.

The blizzard died, visual systems rebooted. We were all still there.

I stood up. The cannon was used to smash rock formations, part of the
open-cast mining operation they had going here. We were just damn lucky
the impact
crater hadn't extended as far as the shoreline or we'd be surfing on ice
floes. My long-range comms returned as upper-atmosphere ionisation faded
away.

"Lazy Gun Two this is Actual. You boys still in one piece, Cooper?"

"Actual this is Lazy Gun Two. I got three viable, two walking-wounded
and three unknown. You want us to push on, L-T? Not sure how long it'll
take to find
a way off the ice though."

"Negative, negative, the mission is scrubbed. Looks like the cannon had
the desired effect and the opposition are now talking about talks, or
some shit
like that. Stand-fast and await evac." He sighed, "Bad day all round,
Cooper."

"No lie, L-T, no lie. Cooper out."

We checked on each other. Ingersoll was a through-and-through flesh
wound, Edwards and Peters just systems failures. But Sargeant Lovell and
McGuire, man,
they were gone.

It took ten minutes or so for the anti-grav masslifter to reach our
location. Civilian, as a combat helo couldn't lift carapace and a
dropship would have
shattered the ice with its down-blast. We attached lifting cables to the
dead so their kit could be salvaged back at base. Plus it looked better
bringing
them home as warriors than in the crappy environmental bodysuits we wore
under full rig.

I was last aboard, port side, and we'd started rising, taking up the
cable slack, when I remembered the goddam drones. They'd probably dock
my pay if I
left them out on the ice so I started hunting through the command
interface for 'auto return' or similar.

The surface-to-air struck us starboard side, exploded.

I fell, the rig registering multiple frontal hits. External vison
failed. Systems started flickering between 'Standby' and 'Wait' -
obviously falling
through the air wasn't something the designers had anticipated.

<i>"Warning, proximity alert. Warning-"</i>

Impact.

<p class="drop">Then it was later.

I'm not sure how much later as the mission timer, comms - shit, just
about everything - was off-line. What I had left was pretty much in
solid back-up
territory but suit integrity was OK and I could still move, still fight.
Visual looked damn weird until I realised I was seeing the world via the
surviving
drones. Apparently my rig was smart enough to come up with its own
workaround. But outside was all bad news.

The masslifter had come down on a rocky outcrop some distance offshore.
The whole forward section was submerged and what wasn't was burning. As
I watched
an armoured figure emerged from the inferno and got as far from the
flames as he could without quitting solid ground. The surrounding ice
was obviously
compromised and unable to take his weight. I saw warning lights blink
and then the carapace sections fell away. Vaughn stepped out of the
remains and
started picking his way over the fractured lake, heading for the
treeline. I guess he felt freezing to death was preferable to slowly
roasting, and a snow
hole might keep him alive until rescue arrived.

His head exploded.

It's the vacuum trail of a hyper-velocity round that does the damage; it
punches clean through and sucks out brain, blood and bone in its wake.
The torso
toppled over and disappeared through a hole in the ice.

I sat up then stood. My head was still way below the top of the snow
bank I'd landed it, so it had kept me alive in more ways than one. The
sniper out
there was obviously a pro, and pros have patience. However he had to be
firing from a spot much further back than I'd originally estimated,
meaning he'd be
completely dependent on remote feed. The good news; he'd never spot me
outside his augmented field of vision. The bad news; I still didn't know
where the
bastard was holed up.

Still, I figured he'd crossed me off his list as by rights I should have
been at the bottom of the lake. Gambling his attention was still
focused on the
wreck and the immediate surroundings I started snow-ploughing my way
inland. Eventually the ground sloped up and I emerged into a belt of
evergreens, with
the impact crater way off to my right. I paused for a moment and gave
myself a visual once-over. Blast damage and shrapnel had scoured the
front of my rig,
meaning the mimetic camo was a no-go. From behind I looked like blurry
pine branches but unless I snuck-up on the sniper ass-first it was now
down to
old-school fieldcraft.

Study the terrain, shift position from concealment to concealment, keep
low, move fast.

Well, keeping low was out and the best I could manage through waist-deep
snow was a laborious surge, but nobody shot me when I moved and that's a
success
in my book. It took maybe fifteen minutes to work my way around the edge
of the crater so that I was coming at Madras Point from the inland side.
I figured
that with us dropping off the grid Lieutenant Hawks would want to scare
up some eyes-on before making his next move. Not that he had much left
to work with
apart from a few flight crew and support techs.

I pressed on, needing a break - and the gods of Karma smiled on me.

Tracks in the snow; two individuals moving one behind the other, heading
towards the mining facility. I started trailing them while keeping to
whatever
cover was on offer. Of course I was depending on the enemy surveillance
- probably drones or landworms - remaining focused on the lake approach.
Powered
armour is designed to be big, bulky and intimidating, so a stealthy
ninja I was not.

Up ahead I saw a branch bend and snap back into position, all on its
own. A voice laughed out of nowhere. I had nothing, not even passive
infrared. I'd be
firing blind and it took my minigun 3.2 seconds to spin-up - which is a
fucking eternity when the bad guy has a weapon that could stop a tank.
Even
assuming it was a heavyweight piece usually fired from a tripod we'd be
in a wintry version of High Noon; a slow-mo gunfight with no prize for
second
place. As I was getting nothing from enhanced vision I shut down the
feed and opened my visor. Jesus it was cold, like the slap you get from
a walk-in
freezer. I felt the internal neck seal tighten, keeping the rest of my
body within an environmental cocoon.

I latched my primary weapon into carry mode and reached for the
breaching tool both NCO's carried on this mission. It was a stubby
shotgun firing shaped
charges - designed to blow entry points in walls. Hardly the most subtle
weapon but I'll take 'indiscriminate' over 'aimed' any day. I brought it
to my
shoulder and marched on, no longer trying to hide, intent on closing the
range as quickly as possible. The only sounds were the rhythmic crunch
of snow and
my shallow breathing. Ice crystals began to form along the rim of my
faceplate.

A blur on the ridgeline against a backdrop of low cloud. Maybe
interference between two stealth fields in close proximity. Adjusted my
aim, fired, zero
recoil. Dropped the shotgun.

Up ahead an explosion, scream. A man-shape covered in St. Elmo's Fire. A
man falling, bloody.

The minigun winding up. Time to take a breath. Shots impacting on my
breastplate; small-calibre shit, no worries. Green light, <i>fire</i>.

The dragon roars, spews a torrent of tracer.

Helmet hit, ricochet, sparks around my head.

<i>"Warning, systems fail-"</i>

<p class="drop">Burning, but cold. It was dark. Not a place I wanted to
be. Someone
whispering&#8230;

"Stim him again, I want this man walking the line."

"Sorry, L-T, but the rig won't play ball. Needs Medical Officer
authorisation to exceed the max safe dose."

"Dammit, do it manually. Christ, stop pussyfooting about, just give it
here."

A hand brushed my face. The pulse-and-numb of a single-shot gas
injector. Hammer-blow to the heart. Drowning; you either rise to the
surface or sink
without trace.

I threw up, coughed. <i>"Get the fuck away from me!"</i>

"That's 'Get the fuck away from me, <i>Sir'!</i>" Lieutenant Hawks
laughed, "Less of your malingering, Cooper, you ain't dead yet."

I blinked, looked about. The rig had defaulted to 'at ease' and my
helmet had been removed. The L-T and two Marines were around me, another
two on guard.
All pretty much anonymous in cold-weather gear but I recognised
Henderson from his shades - real fly-boy cool.

Servos whined as I stood upright. I tried to salute but couldn't move my
right arm, couldn't see from my right eye. "Corporal Gary Cooper
reporting for
duty, Sir."

"Stand down, Marine, we won. You wasted that pair in full view of the
workforce and they caved in, double-time. The hostages have been
released and both
sides are trying to act like nothing happened."

"Nothing happened? Jesus, L-T, we lost seven men out on the ice, plus
the flight crew. That's gotta count for something."

He shook his head. "I hear ya, Marine, I surely do. This whole thing has
been an exercise in inter-corporate shit-stirring but, officially, the
mission is
a success. That means our casualties are <i>acceptable</i>, Corporal. Do
we understand each other?"

"Sir."

He nodded to the two techs dicking with my rig, "Get him operational.
He's walking out of here as a Marine ready for combat, not just some
survivor in his
skivvies."

Lieutenant Hawks moved away, being replaced in my field of vision by
Specialist Brannigan. The tech grinned. "Command are already riding the
L-T's ass over
this, Coop. They want a goddam <i>hero</i>, front-and-centre. So
remember to smile nice while chowing down on all the public relations
bullshit. Damn, they
might even promote you."

I groaned. "Aw hell, why me?"

"Last man standing, bro, last man standing."

Ain't that the truth.

[*ITEM] A New World Order

[*AUTHOR] John A. Frochio

[*BLURB] It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God
but to create him.<br><small>Arthur C. Clarke</small>
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><i>We're getting numb to the
terrorists who decimate our land</i>, thought Benjamin. <i>We're almost
accepting it as a way of life. It's a new world order.</i>

He stared blankly at the dead bodies, the fire, the smoke, the
devastation and the ugly, gaping hole in his building.
<i>Horrific</i>, he thought as he kicked through the ruins.

After the fire and smoke from the explosion had finally cleared, all
that remained of the east end of the state-of-the-art A. I. research
building was a
hollowed out husk and a mass of twisted pipes and wires. Although the
terrorists were still on the loose, a crowd gathered outside the ruins
to gaze in
wonder at the exposed guts of the building.

Alarms were still screaming from all corners of the city. Distant smoke
rose from between buildings in multiple directions. The number of
terrorists
involved in this massive assault was still unknown.

Benjamin Burke, co-founder and developer of this first-of its-kind
building, kicked among the rubble like a pouting child. He was scrawny
in torn heavy
metal T shirt, jeans, sneakers and thinning gray hair. His
unprofessional appearance was not unusual for the eccentric computer
geek and entrepreneur.

The last ambulance left the broken scene with the dead body of his
partner, the formerly staid and stoic Stephen Ellison. With his partner
now dead, could
he rebuild without him? There should be enough money from the insurance.
But would his heart be into it?

He was sure he could rally eventually. Steve would want him to.

His foot struck a cracked flat screen monitor among the debris and he
nearly tripped over it. As he looked down at the broken monitor, it
suddenly lit up.
Schematics appeared on the screen. A metallic voice said, "Issuing
reconstruction designs."

His cell phone buzzed. He held it up and watched the downloading of
dozens of PDF's. Subject: "For Your Review and Approval."

Benjamin stared in disbelief. The A.I. was taking charge.

He grunted. <i>Well, that should save some time</i>.

He put his phone away. He would review them later. He continued
wandering among the ruins.

A noisy ruckus erupted down the street. A mass of people quickly
scattered as three men charged through the crowd, guns drawn and firing.
They were coming
straight toward his ruined building.

Benjamin hurried toward the gaping hole in the building that led into a
corridor lined with office pods. He stumbled over some rubble and fell
several feet
from the entrance. Scrambling to his feet, he found that his pants were
torn at the knees and he was bleeding.

The gunmen burst into the ruins. They weaved their way through the
tangled web of warped metal, wires and piping. The piping began to
vibrate and move. The
piping wrapped itself around the legs and torso of the intruders,
impeding their progress. The more they struggled, the more rapidly the
piping encircled
them like pythons entrapping their prey.

Benjamin stared at the curious spectacle, unable to look away, unable to
force himself to move.

Caught off guard, the surprised gunman were quickly dispatched by the
stranglehold of piping. In less than a minute, it was over. Their
crushed bodies were
left to hang as a warning to future trespassers and a testament to the
glory of a new technology.

Benjamin continued to stare as his phone beeped. He picked up.

"Please review and approve the designs by 7 AM tomorrow morning.
Reconstruction will begin at 7:30 sharp. Any delay is unacceptable."

<i>Well, this is a new world order after all</i>.

He wasted no time, hastily reviewing the updated design specs.
