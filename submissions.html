            <p><strong><em>Mythaxis</em> is currently CLOSED to submissions.</strong></p>
<p>We are open to submissions within the following periods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January 23rd-30th</strong></li>
<li><strong><del>April 23th-30th</del></strong> (this window cancelled in 2023)</li>
<li><strong>July 23rd-30th</strong></li>
<li><strong>October 23rd-30th</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions received outside of these dates will unfortunately be lost and therefore not responded to. When open, we seek and offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Length</strong>: 1,000-5,000 words. This is a firm upper limit. Generally speaking, the further a story goes beyond 5,000 words the more it will need to impress, but the door is not shut in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation</strong>: €0.01 per word, with a €20 minimum. Please be aware that payment is via PayPal only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch. We aim to accept or reject within 14 days of acknowledgment, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. If you do not hear from us after 30 days, feel free to query.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>We acquire <strong>First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity</strong> from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies, in event of which an additional payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the author.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged</strong>. Please tell us if you sim-sub, and we merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible. In the event that we accept first, we expect a positive and timely confirmation. Therefore we recommend sim-subbing to markets of equivalent status – we won&rsquo;t wait for someone else you&rsquo;d like better to turn you down.</p>
<p><strong>If a story has previously been rejected by <em>Mythaxis</em>, please do not resubmit</strong> or inquire regarding doing so, unless explicitly invited to by the editor during the original rejection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Unfortunately, due to increased submission volume, it is no longer possible for us to offer feedback to all authors requesting it. This is a regretful necessity, but without the time required to say something meaningful, feedback loses its value. We may, however, offer some comments when rejecting strong candidate pieces along with an invitation to revise and resubmit.</p>
<p>If you absolutely do <em>not</em> want to receive feedback in the event of rejection, informing us during submission is absolutely acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We do not currently invite reprint submissions</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>All submissions must be the original work of the author</strong>. This is not a market for fan fiction. If your story is a retelling, pastiche, or homage to an existing work, please mention in your email the source you are alluding to.</p>
<p><strong>Content note</strong>: We anticipate an adult readership in the sense of maturity, so reasonable depictions of violence, sexuality, philosophy, or bad language are acceptable. However, this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content, categorisation of which is at the editor&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p><strong>We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds</strong>, be they cultural or personal, and encourage submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences, provided they do not seek to attack or demean those of others.</p>
<p>Finally, if you would like to know more about our editorial policy, <a href="./editorial-policy.html">read on here</a>. Any inquiries can be directed to the editor at the above email address.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-submit">HOW TO SUBMIT</h3>
<p>Email files as an attachment to: <strong><a href="mailto:MythaxisMagazine@gmail.com">MythaxisMagazine@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Please use the email subject line <strong>MYTHAXIS SUBMISSION – <em>YOUR STORY TITLE</em></strong> to evade spam filters (and when we say <em>&ldquo;your story title&rdquo;</em>, we don&rsquo;t mean that literally…).</p>
<p>Feel free to include a concise cover letter and/or author bio, though neither is mandatory. <em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> welcomes authors of all levels of experience. We have a history of publishing first-time authors, and we mean to continue this tradition.</p>
<p>If you track your submissions, you can find <em><strong>Mythaxis Magazine</strong></em> on <a href="https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/Market?id=10939#">The Submissions Grinder</a> and <a href="https://duotrope.com/listing/10263/mythaxis-magazine">Duotrope</a>.</p>
<h3 id="formatting-guidelines">FORMATTING GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>Acceptable document types are DOC, DOCX, and ODT (plus RTF, if you absolutely have to).</p>
<p>Straightforward manuscript formatting is preferred for editorial convenience. We recommend using <a href="https://www.shunn.net/format/story/">Shunn&rsquo;s excellent Modern Manuscript formatting guide</a>, but in particular consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please use an easy-reading font (Times New Roman 12pt is preferred).</li>
<li><strong>Do not manually insert</strong> empty lines between paragraphs. <strong>Do not use tabs</strong> for first-line indents. <strong>Use automatic paragraph formatting</strong> to set indents or paragraph breaks.</li>
<li>Use a single centred # to represent essential section breaks.</li>
<li>Use <em>italics</em> for italics, don’t underline. Smart (“curly”) punctuation is preferred, but consistency is preferred more.</li>
<li>If your manuscript includes any unusual formatting, please alert the editors when submitting and have a really good, story-related reason.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-notes-on-artificial-intelligence">SOME NOTES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
<p><em><strong>Mythaxis</strong></em> has both a simple and more complicated relationship with regard to the use of AI tools in fiction and publishing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submissions</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We are not interested in submissions featuring prose created by generative &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo;, algorithmic systems, large language models, or similar tools.</strong>  The questionable provenance of AI-derived content, and the uncertain legality of claiming &ldquo;authorship&rdquo; of the output of AI-tools, means that knowingly signing a contract of sale for an AI-generated submission would be inappropriate. We hope that submitting authors will respect our position on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We use a number of data analytics tools to study narrative patterns regarding the material that is submitted to us for consideration.</strong> These are experiments to investigate ways to automate and simplifiy our administrative tasks and fall under labels such as &ldquo;Digital Humanities&rdquo;, &ldquo;Distant Reading&rdquo;, &ldquo;Data science&rdquo; and &ldquo;Machine learning&rdquo;. They are not <em>generative tools</em>: they are in no way used to simulate the actual content of other people&rsquo;s work, and are unable to output prose content derived from it. They are anonymised for strict internal use only, and data is NOT <em>fed to external AI companies</em> under any circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We fully recognise the importance of authorial ownership when it comes to an individual&rsquo;s rights. This is why we cannot accept AI-derived submissions, and why we ensure any analysis of material is not capable of materially benefiting from it, nor of producing any derivitive creative works.</p>
<p>We hope that our digital publishing activities will not dissuade authors from submitting. We are of course completely willing to remove authors from our data set should they request it.</p>
