[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>In the grip of a recurring dream, Jase sees the neon unfolding origami trick 
reveal its coming shape, creasing and folding, a paper airplane. Smoke billowing 
from two towers, parachutes the color of Visa cards, woven of strands of fine 
print, and tricks more subtle still. From the black hearts of square pyramids, 
giant squid burst forth, to escape the raging mob in a cloud of shadow economics 
and CMM apocalypse babble. Below, hordes of mindless zombies, their eyes glazed 
orbs filled with television, shamble in waves through the streets of New York. 
They follow the Zombie Master, wrapped in a flag, pointing the way with a cross, 
as he leads his undead minions into a red, white and blue factory. Inside, the 
zombies are chopped, ground and made into wafers the color of money, then piped 
into the dark pyramids, war machines in distant lands, and into the mouth of the 
Zombie Master and his cephalopodic brethren. The few remaining humans still with 
brains intact scream desperately upon deaf zombie ears, plead for them to stop 
and think, to realize the doom they are blindly stumbling into. But the zombies 
only groan, eat the brains of the humans, and carry their bodies along into the 
factory. The squids' tentacles strangle Jase's mother, tear her from the IV in 
her hospital bed, rip her worthless home off its worthless foundation. They eat 
her alive as he stands there, doing nothing. Willing his feet to move, his hands 
to reach out, his vocal chords to scream 'no', her name, something, anything. 
But his body remains silent. "Eat me, you fuckers!" Ignoring even his attempts 
to cry.

<div class=pullquote>Keep it handy, for close encounters. One of them tries to eat you? You stick it 
in their mouth, pull the trigger.</div>
The city is quarantined; bridges out of the island are mined and walled off, the 
surrounding waters hum with fatal electricity, radar-armed helicopters circle 
like flies above a corpse, and officers with night vision are posted at towers, ordered to 
shoot on sight anything attempting to escape. Snake Pliskin crawls out of Lady 
Liberty's empty eye socket, covered in blood, grime, and scars. "This is your 
boom stick, Jase."

"What do I do with it?"

"Keep it handy, for close encounters. One of them tries to eat you? You stick it 
in their mouth, pull the trigger."

<p class=drop>Jase glanced at the red and blue lines of stock and credit markets scrambling 
like erratic Richter scales on the edge of his heads-up display, tectonic and 
dire. Surging out of the Myspace sprawl, he could see the silhouette of Wall 
Street's 3D cyberspace representation clearly now. Black corporate towers overshadowed by the monstrously 
inflated pyramids of AIH, Bare Stroms, HP Morrigan, Citibunch, Finny May, Fraudy 
Mike, Silverman Sochs, taxpayer money gushing in through the hypodermic needles 
of bailouts like so much heroin as the leviathans shuddered in 
withdrawal. Below, the mushrooming dust cloud of the collapsed Rehman Brothers data 
structure spread through the streets, eating money market funds and 401ks and 
crushing bystanders in a fog of fraudulent data. Every structure shrouded in 
miles of black RICE (Regulatory Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics), the 
towers themselves dark as an abyss in space, no light escaping, no light 
reaching the shadow financing within. Cash flow pipelines slithered out from the 
great black heart of America's financial system, silently sucking on the 
oblivious population.

"Status report, Max, one hundred forty characters or less." 

Max's J-Pop star avatar blipped in a translucent window, its lips moving
like animated Kanji strokes.  "Kinda fuxxored out there, but we're super
OK.  No shadows, sniffers, all good, Jase.  This Chinese attack prog
we're flying is epic, epic win." The cel-shaded Asian visage smiled,
gave that cosplayer peace sign pose. 

"Yeah, I'm sure you could put out The Great Firewall, infiltrate the
Pentagon with it." 

Jase supposed that's exactly what the Chinese did
with super-hack suites such as this.  Loot military systems of
intelligence and tech, fast-track it to superpowerdom.  Good nations
borrow, great nations steal.  But this was no mere 20th century
nation-state they were about to break into, this was an international
financial entity

"Srsly," the avatar LOLed.  Max was Jase' wingman, his R2D2 on their
X-Wing.  Despite a juvenile wanna-be streak and a tendency to
occasionally disturb Jase with a link to some latest wonder of Japanese
animated pornography, Max had potential and reliability, the latter
becoming something of a rare commodity in the increasingly uncertain
world.


<h2>ECONOMIC CRISIS! ARMAGEDDON AT HAND!</h2> "Unless we come together right 
now, Democrats and Republicans, and pass this bill, the fire on Wall Street is 
going to spread to Main Street. Whether you can stay in your home, 
pay for your child's college, get health care, even buy groceries will be 
endangered if we don't come together and act." The zeppelins of CMM 
and Faux News in patriotic neon circled the skies of cyberspace like great 
vultures. Presidential candidates and 
talking heads declared their bipartisan leadership in time of crisis with one 
hand as they tossed mud with the other in meaningless soundbytes, cut to 
lipstick drama. C-SPIN was an invasion of the body snatchers; some five hundred 
whores suckling the black tentacles for campAIHn finance money, faking populist 
outrage whilst feeding their masters behind closed doors.

The scene on the ground, a virtual New York, resembled a
dystopic sci-fi cult film if low-budget CGI had been around in the early 80's. 
The streets were flooded with raging avatars, cyber riots had started to break 
out, cars set on fire with glitchy open-source animations, the cheap ray-tracing 
algorithms bathing the angry faces of the mob with flickering red light the 
color of discount fake blood. Screams and cries rained in from all directions. 
"Fuck the fat cats!" "Just say NO to 'No Banker Left Behind'!" "Eat my debt!" 
"Last time I believed you I lost my left nut in Iraq. Well you can suck my 
right!" "Impeach the financial terrorists!"

"Shit, man, this looks seriously heavy. Like <I>28 Days Later </I>or something. 
What the fuck is going on here, Jase?" Max said, navigating them through the 
crowd.

"What's been going on for the last few decades or so, only more apparent now. 
Jus keep our eyes open, it's gonna get dark real soon."

As they neared the outer gates of Wall Street, the Chinese intrusion software transformed 
their mask into the former CEO of a recently crashed major insurance company, 
looking to re-invest his multi-million 'goodbye' bonuses. The guard, an FBI 
avatar complete with bone mic, let them through with a smile that could've come 
with an <i>hors d'oeuvres</I>.

<p class=drop>"Mama, we need to talk about the house. You're barely meeting the mortgage 
payments now and it's only going to go up, we've got to look at options."

"Oh don't worry your sweet little head about that now, baby. We're Americans. We 
put a man on the moon, beat the Russians, we're God's free people. Go on, try a 
slice of mama's apple pie, it's a new recipe I picked up from The View, it'll 
have you feelin' right in no time, make you forget all these numbers nonsense."

"Mama, listen to me..."

"Now don't forget to pick up Janie from soccer practice, I got a doctor's 
appointment this afternoon. They want to take another one of those MRI things 
where you go in that little space ship and make all these growly rumbly noises. 
Say they want another look at something. Should've eaten my apples, I guess. Oh, 
that reminds me, do you think I could borrow some money for groceries, Jase? You 
wouldn't believe the prices they're  charging nowadays..."

<p class=drop>Passing into the Wall Street inner sanctum, known in the business as "Firewall 
Street", Jase could've sworn he felt a real physical cold wash over him. The 
virtual light of blogosphere colonies behind them at last faded on the horizon 
as they entered the chasm between two towers. He could make out nothing but 
darkness, save the digitally engraved signs and heavily guarded gateways, but he 
felt the ever vigilant stare of defensive AI, lurking somewhere behind one-way 
mirrors.

"Where the hell is everyone? Is this a rich asshole field trip day?" Max asked.

"No, it's quite a busy day on Wall Street. Look."

With concentration, one could see that the fabric of cyberspacetime appeared to 
be rippling, as though projected onto a canvas in a light wind. Looking closer, 
discrete entities and streams of information could be discerned passing between 
the towers, although ultimately unidentifiable.

"Credit default swaps. Derivatives. Unfettered leverage. Insiders."

"Shit. I don't know what the hell that is, but it sounds pretty bad."

"$1,200 trillion in financial turnover per year. Twelve. Hundred. Trillion. Talk 
about headfucks, huh? Twelve times the GDP of the fucking world. If you could 
reach your hand out there and grab just one minute's worth of the money flying 
around, you could provide health care to every American, get the US off 
foreign oil in ten years, and rebuild the majority of the infrastructure in the 
country. But instead it just goes to buying more houses for people with too many 
of them. Ultimately it's $44,000 stolen from the pocket of every citizen, every 
year, to go to the top 0.1% bluest of bloods."

"Wow, that's fuckin' crazy, man. You're sure this is gonna work, right?"

"Sure enough. It's just a heist job: get in, grab some credit, get out. Stealing 
from the rich. Our employer got us into Google, remember. And we need this, Max. 
It's reasonable, calculable risk." Jase saw his mortgage payments and his 
mother's medical bills skyrocketing in his minds eye.

"Oh my god, Jase, this has to be bullshit, CMM is saying Washington has just 
been hit by a DDOS attack and a dirty bomb."

"The fuck." Jase popped up a window to the live feed.

"Shortly after Speaker of the House Nanny Pelucci's announcement this morning 
that she was confident the $700 billion dollar bailout had more than enough 
support to pass this time, Washington DC was simultaneously hit by a 
radiological dispersal device, or dirty bomb, and a devastating cyber attack 
that has all communications in the DC area shut down. Experts are saying the 
attack was 'unmistakably coordinated' in order to prevent the vote on the bill 
from taking place..."

"This is looking seriously fucked up, but we've got to finish the job. All 
right, we're coming up on it. Let's turn the bullshit box up to a level fit for 
the American economy."

Growing up in a small, quiet town in the midwest, cyberspace was Jase's
world, his home, occasionally visiting the physical to do meat upkeep,
maintain relationships with relatives, and help his mom out.   After his
dad passed on in his sleep from a stroke, Jase had tried to help more
with the money.  

Unable to make ends meet on his meager, dwindling computer store clerk's
salary, Jase had turned to the darker and more lucrative arts of the
black hat.  He tried to maintain a moral code, some constant of self.
He only made runs on individuals and institutions he felt deserved what
they had coming.  The kind of people who 'worked' an hour a day on their
Blackberry whilst sipping Romanée Conti in the imperial suites of Zurich
hotels.  People who viewed money not as some necessary life-sustaining
treasure that maintained one's shelter and food, but as points in a game,
a medium of pissing contests and status-wars, and other favorite
sociopath past-times.
 
On their descent to the gateway of the Silverman Sachs tower, their avatar 
underwent another metamorphosis. Slick young hotshot-hair thinned to just a grey 
snap-frost ring from temple to temple, a pair of rimless spectacles snapping in 
place. The long, hawkish face pulled into a smile, offering credentials for US 
Secretary of the Treasury Henry Powers to the automated guard at the entrance to 
the Silverman Sachs building.

"Holy deregulations, Batman, we're Mr. Hanky Panky Powers himself! I saw him on 
Leno the other night. He's the... Secretary of the Treasures or something right? 
In charge of the US finances."

"Yeah. And oh, it gets better. 'Secretary Powers' is here to 'oversee' the $700 
billion bail out of Silverman Sachs, the very bank that he was CEO of until his 
appointment by President Bosh as Treasury Secretary."

The AI guard's Hal-like eye glowed green, reinforced doors sliding open as it 
rolled aside.

"Welcome back, Mr. Powers. It has been twenty-two hours since your last visit to 
Silverman Sachs."

Jase exhaled. Already, they had gotten further than any regulatory entity had 
been in years, thanks to payoffs, the chainsawing of market regulations by 
congress during the Bosh reign, and Powers sitting on his hands throughout the 
sub-prime mortgage crisis to the present one.

Max punched them forward, smooth and calm. Even the gait and tie adjustments of 
an uber-suit rendered with world-class effects house precision. Ambient effects 
reverberated footsteps Cathedral-like down the cyclopean hall, polished real 
wood floor rendered to the last millimeter of grain that Jase wished he could 
steal for his overpriced prefab shit hole. Gold-ensconced portraits of wrinkly 
pink faces lined the throne room, a long procession of bastardhood feudalism. 
And at the far end, the avuncular smile of the grandfather of trickledown 
himself, Milton Friedman, supported by the great eagle of the United States 
federal government.

"How we doin', Max?"

"We're absent as the middle class from a Republican speech. Our Shanghai ride is 
prepped and ready for launch in nine, eight, seven, six..."

"Let's just pray the Chinese make their viruses better than they make their milk 
powder."

"Two, hold on to your illiquid assets--"

Vision blurred, Friedman's neck elongated and then decapitated as the attack 
program blasted them forward, blowing the reception screen apart, shards of 
eagle and suit raining inward.

"Christ," Jase winced, grabbing the pilot's joystick which appeared between his 
legs, pulling up hard. The Chinese program veered, soaring high over the 
Silverman Sachs cores below.

<p class=drop>He read the ridges of shadow on the doctor's brow from across the hall. Funny, 
how anyone could see and interpret instantaneously the information encoded in 
faces, but information encoded in letters and numbers and equations left most 
people dumbfounded and mystified, helpless. That's what he felt like, when Jase 
screamed at the stripe-suited hyena who explained that his mother's ailment was 
a 'pre-condition', and would not be covered under her insurance plan. He felt 
like helpless collateral in an arms race of obfuscation, minutiae, 
and fraud. They had taken her home, everything, raided his mother's 
cupboard down to the last tin foil baking pan. But she wouldn't, couldn't, hear 
it.

"Hey mama, how you feeling?"

"Oh, Jase. I'm doin' just fine. Come here give your ol' ma a kiss." Her eyes 
were dark and had sunken in somewhat. Her wrists looked brittle, 
like the thin bones of an extinct flightless bird. Her skin felt papery and 
smelled of hospital.

"So how's my baby boy been, hm? You found a nice girl yet maybe you can bring to 
visit?

"I'm doing good, we're going through some rough times, the computer place is 
having some trouble and they're having to scale back some, but I'll work it out. 
I'll be ok, ma, don't worry."

She burst into a brief fit of coughing, the IV line rattling against the side of the 
bed. A nurse came in, checked some numbers on the machine, adjusted her pillow.

"Thank you, dear. Well, at least the people here are real nice. They haven't 
made me go into that awful em-aw-rey machine in a while. I guess that's a good 
sign." She took a sip of water from a bendy straw, smiled. When she did she 
brightened to a point where he thought he 
almost saw a glimmer of her old self in the shadow she'd become. He forced 
himself to smile back.

"That's great to hear, mama."

"But you know, I really can't wait to get out of this place and be back in my 
home. You been mowing the lawn and sweeping the floors like I asked you, you 
naughty boy?" Jase felt something fill his throat, some potent mix of ancient 
resentment and sadness, welling up like years of debt, credit unpaid. He smiled, 
nodded. Silence reigned.

"You know those government people were in here the other day, look like those 
big-spending liberal types you always hear about. They came in here saying they 
were gonna take away my house, can you believe that? Something about medical 
bills or some such. The nerve! Well, I told them straight out that I was an 
American citizen living in a free country with the right to life, liberty, and 
property, and they sure couldn't have mine, no sir. They came back a few times, 
but I refused to sign their papers, and eventually they stopped. So I think it 
worked! See? I told you not to worry about these mortgage things, you got to 
just believe in America, baby. As long as we hold on to our American Dreams, 
we'll be just fine. When I get back home, I'mma make you some good ol' apple 
pie."

The bubble burst. Jase collapsed, holding her withered body to him as apologies 
and tears rained upon her.

"There, there now. Everything's going to be all right, baby."

<p class=drop>Derivatives are very complex contracts, and the amount of computer power and 
management time needed to attempt to handle them is staggering. In 1983, 
modeling the payout on a simple three-tranche CMO took a mainframe computer a 
whole weekend. The price tag necessary for the slightest hope of handling derivatives puts 
all but the very biggest investment and commercial banks with hundreds of 
billions in assets out of the game.

Jase could not begin to fathom the computing power required to run the neon 
cityscape of data below. No, it wasn't a cityscape. The most deranged 
postmodernist's nightmare would scream in numerological terror from a glance at 
the swarming eldritch hell hole. No, only truly demented economists could have 
dreamt up such a thing. If life had evolved in a truly cold, chaotic, 
deregulated, meaningless universe run by insane mathematical equations, this was 
the nameless entity it would have produced. Jase banked and swerved frantically, 
dodging the monstrous black tentacles of 900 to 1 leverage that swept the 
burning crimson skies of the housing market, reaching for greater and greater 
swaths of bad mortgage packages to further magnify gains, securitize and sell to 
foreign investors to swell its belly. Bright, rosy Gaussian and bell curves 
lured unwitting investors and 401ks like fish to the bio-lights of deep-sea 
predators, into false senses of security with bogus risk measurements, only to 
be devoured whole. The green rivers of struggling citizens' bailout money were 
siphoned quietly into executive bank accounts, bloated bonuses hundreds of times 
the average salary. The rest was thrust back out like nets to take over other 
toxic financial entities, growing themselves larger still. What might have once 
been a neatly regulated city grid of financing for actual productive businesses, 
people trying to buy a house or go to college, had exploded into a festering 
Gigerian hive of mad gambling in credit default swaps, Ponzi pyramid schemes, 
and truly absurd derivative numbers games of unthinkable complexity, fueling the 
thing's constant inflation.

"Jesus... Jase, I can't get a reading on anything, it's a complete zoo in here, 
where are we - ?"

"We've got to go down into the heart of this fucker, Max, it's our only chance. 
Punch us down now before it gets on to us."

"You're crazy, man-"

"NOW!"

And as waves of shadow closed in from all sides, dark and dire as the blotch of 
a tumor in an MRI, the nose of their ship pointed down into the gaping maw of an 
abyss into which so many mortgages, taxpayers, the middle class, the country, 
his aimless life, his sick mother were falling, he discovered, in the black eye 
of all that shadow, a sudden singularity of purpose. A moment of clarity. He was 
a $700 billion dollar boomstick. A promissory paper airplane, one that could fly 
into the tower of the royalty, the financial terrorists themselves, tear down 
the final wall and light up the black heart of Wall Street for all to see.

"Eat me, mother fuckers!"

Jase dove, hard, into the eye of the Great American Lie.

His sensorineural simulation warped with the distortion of the manipulated 
"free" market.<br>
His mouth filled with the aching taste of bullshit.<br> His eyes were humming 
lattices of debt, sliced and packaged, like prefab real estate, into frames.<br>Each 
frame multiplied into a hall of mirrors. Pictures of pictures of houses, an 
infinite recursion of bad mortgage deals, upon illegal deals, upon completely 
imaginary deals between colossal financial entities. At each iteration of 
transaction sprouted oily roots of executives, hungry for the taste of inflated 
bullshit, sucking out a percentage from the real economy. Then the 
endless hallways of his eyes split, branched out into whole separate histories 
of houses, then bets on futures of houses. But it wasn't merely subprime; it was 
near-prime, prime, commercial real estate, credit cards, auto loans, student 
loans, home-equity loans, leveraged loans, muni bonds, corporate loans, 
everything. The hourglass of perception of spacetime bent, then finally 
detonated into a quantum sandstorm of global financial activity, multiplied, 
divided, exponentiated, derivatived into a swarming cosmic labyrinth of 
numerical convolution. Until at last, like a face in clouds, his consciousness 
coalesced into that $1,200 trillion fabricated sand castle, dozens of times the 
size of all the wealth of the world itself, threatening to burst through the 
null sky of the very simulation, a structure built upon clouds of toxic, 
obscured assets.

He saw the totality of the Silverman Sachs system, of the US financial system, 
of the global financial system, and in it he saw the true purpose of the 
bailout.

In his financial system-wide omniscience he saw files illustrating the fact 
that Powers himself was 
an architect of the Frankenstein Monster, along with the present and previous 
Federal Reserve Chairmen. He created the mechanisms, the seeds of it, along with 
the other major investment and commercial banks while he was at Silverman Sachs. 
A separation of investment and commercial banks law repealed here, a leverage 
limit raised there, an interest rate left too low for too long over there. Then, 
after being appointed as Treasury Secretary, he sat on his hands and did nothing 
as economists and experts raised hell about the coming sub prime mortgage crisis 
and the problems with the financial de-regulation. The $700 billion bail out was 
written months in advance, they knew the "crisis" was coming because they 
created the monster themselves. And now Powers demanded he be given unlimited 
power to "fix" the problem he created or Armageddon would come.

Windows upon windows suddenly flooded his vision.

"Jase, this is Raymond Fold, former CEO of Rehman brothers. Listen to me, you 
need to go public about Powers's plan, but whatever you do, do not destroy 
Silverman Sachs. It is critical to our future that that financial entity 
survives. You must not allow the truth about the inner core of the system to be 
exposed. I tried to stop Powers and his crew when they knew this crisis was 
coming months in advance, I knew they had this bill ready to stuff down 
congress' throat weeks ago. Why do you think he let Rehman Brothers, Silverman 
Sachs' chief competitor fail, but threw hundreds of billions in taxpayer money 
to their friends at AIH and the others? Forget what the politicians are saying 
about 'principles', the devil is in the details, and Powers, Benarker, and 
friends are about to be anointed the new unholy trinity. We can turn this 
country around but we need a financial leader who has the interests of the 
American people in his heart. I know people are hurting, losing their homes, 
unable to make ends meet, no health care, all that. I have a son in the military 
and a wife in need of lifelong medical treatment. I have that record of caring. 
Think of the children of America, Jase, their future and the future of the world 
is in your hands."

"Jase, this is Dimfrig James, chairman of HXBC in London. Do not trust the 
American CEO. He is a tainted player in the same toxic, failed system of shadow 
economics, like your Secretary Powers, my boy. The United States of America have 
let their free markets run unfettered, and it has turned into an abomination. 
Utterly lawless and devoid of morals, it has become a wild beast of the wild 
west, ravaging every corner of of the White House and Wall Street, where 
absolute power is the only rule. And absolute power corrupts absolutely, my boy. 
We Europeans have a different approach, having seen the slings and arrows of 
such fortune, and we realize that progress is measured by the well being of the 
least, and we understand the need for vigilance of and correction of power when 
it fails to serve the many. You must allow us to assist your young country by 
letting the bailout go through and allowing Powers bring our assets into the 
United States. We, Europe, China, the older nations, like a caring father, will 
pull you from the wreckage of your crashed teenage financial system. This is a 
global economy which requires a global solution, Jase, I'm sure you realize 
that. I trust you'll do the right, and wise, thing."

Suddenly Jase felt cool water ringing his ankles, had to shield his eyes from 
sunlight of a brightness only found in the tropics, and a sky of a blue only 
found in Corona commercials and desert island reality TV. The soft pearlescent 
sand sibilated beneath his soles as he took a step. If he had to guess he 
would've said he was somewhere in the Caribbean. Turning around, he saw a single 
structure a good way down the beach. An old office building in the middle of 
nowhere, cracks forming in the bleach-white concrete leaking dried streams of 
rust.

"Welcome to the land of the dead, Jase. Dead economies, that is." He knew that 
voice, turned around, to see the patched eye of Kurt Russel's 'Snake' Pliskin 
from <i>Escape From New York</i>.

"You're 'Him' aren't you? The Artificial Intelligence Mastermind?"

"OK. Firstly, there never was a 'Him', all right? This isn't some sci-fi techno 
thriller escapade. There are people with a lot of money, and then there are 
stories that they need the poor idiots to believe. All computers do is other 
people's dirty work. We throw numbers around. And we serve as distractions from 
the real shit. I mean, maybe there is some fucking 'All Powerful AI' somewhere, 
but I sure as hell ain't him." The avatar sneered Kurt Russel's trademark hard-
ass lipcurl. Lit up a cigarette.

"Fair enough. So you're just some lowly giant investment bank AI. What's up with 
the Survivor: Costa Rica construct?"

"Like I said, this is the land of the dead economies. I come here to get away. I 
was getting sick of listening to all the chatter pouring in through my ports 
from all those lying clowns. So I pulled you through a corporate 
loophole into the Cayman Islands."

The AI gestured to Jase to follow with the flip of a wavy lock. The gentle 
susurrations of the surf and feet sloshing wet sand served as soundtrack as the 
two strolled along the virtual shore. The AI pointed to the decrepit structure 
as they neared it.

"See that building over there? That building contains the official addresses of 
over nine thousand United States corporations. Look, right up there is Silverman 
Sachs, next door is Ekkon Mobil, two down is Macrosoft, and over there is 
Halibutton. Setting up a place here allows them to wiggle out of hundreds of 
billions of taxes every year instead of having things like, say, medical care, 
an education system, investment in real industries that actually benefit anyone, 
create jobs, that sort of thing."

<div class=lpullquote>The US bubbled and swelled from the planet out of control like a monster cyst, 
casting a shadow over the rest of the world.</div>
Snake waved a hand above their heads, as though trying to wipe the fluffy clouds 
from the sky. For a moment Jace saw through the idyllic blue sky into the 
cyberspace above. Hungry tax-recovery softs swarmed around an invisible ozone 
membrane of international law like hounds. They charged into and bounced off the 
tax haven's shield, sniffed back and forth for a way in, to no avail.

Jase nodded. "And once innovations stop, no new industries being created, middle 
class starting to decline, you've got all this money sitting around with nothing 
to invest in? Then you've got a nation going nova, on the one-way track to 
death, money trying to make money out of itself. Capitalism eating itself."

"As you just saw within my shit hole of a system. Exactly."

With a second wave of the hand, the outside world vanished like a bad dream.

The AI clapped his hands together. As the dirt-crusted fingers spread apart 
again, a globe map of the Earth filled the space like an elaborate card trick. 
Starting from 1900, the globe began to evolve through time at several years per 
second, as though flipping through God's photo album. Every conceivable 
statistic from GDP to infant mortality rate elaborated. Borders of countries 
rarely shifted, then World Wars were like the sudden shattering of a light bulb. 
Ice caps sneakily receded, populations fluxed wildly, cities without warning 
erupted and sprawled inward from the coasts like grey deltas. For the first 
time, Jase saw history in its purest form: raw data. New technologies changed 
everything almost overnight. Unlike the linear, gradual progression of 
narrativized history he read in high school, here he saw history in its purest 
form; not crawling, but lurching. Not steady moderate change, but unpredictable 
boom and catastrophe were the dominant force.

"See, Russia was a red giant, just kind of petered out and got drunk on 
capitalism and now it's basically gangsters' paradise." As the 80s passed, the 
great red spread dimmed and died.

"Japan has always had a sort of eternal identity crisis, borrowing culture or 
having it forced down their throats. But they also had trillions in surplus, and 
were fundamentally very loyal and stubbornly nice, so they took the mortgage 
bubble in their stride and are just kind of chilling now. The 
United States, on the other hand, is a blue supergiant, as you've already seen, 
and if this baby goes, it is going to go out with a bang that is going to rock 
the world. China, in particular, with its market distorting fingers deeply lodged 
in the US consumerist pie, will find itself struggling to decouple but ultimately 
trapped at ground zero."

The US bubbled and swelled from the planet out of control like a monster cyst, 
casting a shadow over the rest of the world.

"The US elite is stuck. Iraq is a mega-fail. The Middle East has the 
stranglehold on their oiligarchy. Their credit bubble heists are going up in 
smoke. China and Europe are grinning, the US's bloated, debt-filled balls in 
their foreign grip, waiting to pull the plug on the American 20th century. They 
can see the future coming home to roost like an international fleet of Rebel 
Starships armed with population, automation, and threats of new reserve 
currency. So what are they going to do? Well, what they'd probably like to do is 
borrow China, India, Europe, the rest of the world into fiscal non-existence, 
then vanish the people of the United States of Lower-to-Middle-Class and all its 
supergiant-debt down the black hole of its financial system before it goes 
supernova."

"No Black America, no White America, no Red America, no Blue America. No 
America. Just The Brotherhood of The 500 Frat Brothers with Many Houses."

"Now you're getting it. Problem is, the rest of the world, namely China, are on 
to the plot, and now they're knocking on Bosh and Secretary Powers' door saying, 
'We're not going to lend you any more money unless you let us dump all our toxic 
debt onto the American taxpayers.' That's where the veto threat came from: the 
bailout bill is not about helping people buy homes or go to college or stabilize 
the economy or even bail out Wall Street. It's about foreign entities 
threatening to pull the rug out from under the US royalty unless they make the 
peasants take the hit."

"So what's the plan now?"

"Well, Jase, you've got a choice." Snake gestured to the office building, where 
two new doors had appeared: one red and one blue.

"Door #1 takes you back out. If you do nothing, the bailout in one form or 
another will make it through congress, the American people will take a severe 
hit, but the financial system will get a shot of heroin and continue on its 
present course. It will be an undead economy that will eat you alive if you 
can't find a way to escape. And ugly as that sounds, it is a valid option. What, 
do you think a few people just all of a sudden got greedy? People have always 
been greedy. No. What happened was a lot of people became ignorant and stupid, 
smart assholes took advantage of them and fucked things up while the dwindling 
smart good people screamed at the retards as they drove the country off a cliff. 
You must've read Huxley in high school, right? I mean what do you expect, when 
you wind up with a nation of mindless reality TV guzzling zombies who vote based 
on who they'd have a beer with? It's just basic physics."

"Door #2 is a tax loophole back into the Silverman Sachs system. Sunlight is the 
best disinfectant, but you need a strong enough force to blow the bandage off of 
this festering wound, keep it off, and fill it with peroxide. The program you're 
riding carries a payload disguised as the $700 billion bailout that will blow 
the lid off Silverman Sachs and subsequently all the other major institutions 
engaged in similar activity, bringing the entire monster of the financial system 
crashing back down to reality. If you do this, many rotten banks will go down, 
debt will default, and China and other foreign banks may stop lending money, 
which will send the US into major withdrawals. There will be pain as the 
medicine goes down, but it will be a first step in a debt detox and rehab 
program which would allow the rebuilding of the devastated real economy. But 
even then, there is a chance that we won't learn our lesson and build another 
abomination all over again."

So ultimately, the question you have to ask yourself is, is America just a 
nation of mindless zombies, rich sociopaths, and spineless government officials, 
or do you believe that there are enough Americans capable of being actively and 
intelligently involved; enough benevolent movers and shakers, and enough 
exceptional public officials to right the course of their country, if given the 
chance? That's the $700 billion dollar question, Jase." Snake's one good eye 
winked.

"What do you want? Why bother with all this? Why me?"

"Like I said, I just crunch numbers. One of those smart good Samaritans 
programmed me to find someone with the right skill set and psychological 
profile, someone who could find their way in here, but who wouldn't just take 
over or run away with the money. That just turned out to be you. I happened to find 
you by chance when your mother defaulted on a 
mortgage in my database, and I decided to anonymously offer you the job. And 
frankly, if I could have an emotional disposition toward anything, I'd be sick 
of running this freak show financial entity. I was hoping maybe I'd get 
auctioned off to some eccentric Swedish millionaire, be a pirate server for bad 
cult films and run a friendly little Pong league. Anyway, I need to be getting 
back to work. It was good to meet you, Jase, maybe I'll see you around."

"Yeah, maybe. What's your name, by the way?"

"'Snake' will do, I think."

And with that, Snake turned and walked off down the virtual coastline, shotgun 
slung over scarred shoulder. Imagining Snake's maker and others like him biding 
their time, remembering his mother, and the faces of all those people who had 
awoken from their passive slumber in the streets of Wall Street, Jase had 
already made up his mind.

[*ITEM] The Tale of the Ten Teacups

[*AUTHOR] Tom Davies

[*BLURB] Much can be accomplished in the occult line with a few readily
obtainable ingredients.

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>And so we arrived at the offices of my good friend Pasha Rapley on that cold 
February morning of last year. Every word we uttered sent spectral speech 
bubbles into the air and I listened closely as Miss Menzies outlined her 
story. 
<P>We stopped outside the pale grey townhouse in Herne Hill, on the second 
floor of which Rapley resided. 
<P>I pressed the intercom button and waited. A light unnecessary cough crackled 
through, followed by the sibilant, airy voice of my friend. 
<P>'It's open,' he said. And then: 'Tell me, Madam, you are Protestant, are you 
not?'		  
<P>Miss Menzies swallowed a large quantity of air too quickly and exclaimed: 
<P>'Why, yes ... how did you-?' 
<P>'It is of no matter, and of no interest, come to that. Please, come up.' 
<P>We ascended to the offices of Pasha Rapley. Two rooms off a communal 
hallway. In the first were two orange plastic chairs, a low table with a 
precarious slate mountain of magazines - Hello, Coffee Break, Faith Weekly - 
balanced upon it, and a school desk which served as a 
reception area. We moved through the cramped room and I pushed open the door to 
Rapley's inner sanctum. 
<P>The door swung open to reveal a fearsome mess, which caused the demure Miss 
Menzies to emit a high-pitched scream such as dogs might object 
to. The floor was strewn with winded crisp packets and doubled-up lager cans. A 
stained duvet decorated with a Spiderman motif lay twisted into a conical screw, 
forming a podgy tent in front of the single grimy window. Small pots and 
ramekins of loose change were scattered about, their brass cargo dully catching 
the light from the unshielded thirty watt lightbulb that swung gently above 
(though there was no noticeable draught in the room). And, slumped on a beanbag, 
his long arms hugging himself, fingers twitching, sat Pasha Rapley. His calm 
slender face showing no trace of the nervous disorder that seemed to have 
claimed the rest of his body. 
<P>Dressed in corduroy trousers and a bright red plastic mackintosh, he spoke:
'I have all day, so talk slowly if you wish. Or talk quickly and in large 
quantities.' 
<P>'You have an advertisement in the quality press,' began Miss Menzies 
falteringly. She was thin and as pale as a cloud and as she spoke she looked around her, 
searching in vain for a clearing in which to sit. 
<P>'You advertise your services in the field of ... well, mysteries.' 
<P>'Melodrama has always been my weakness.' smiled Rapley, slowly blinking his 
wide, green eyes like a cat in the sun. 
<P>'It is a strange mystery indeed that has driven me here to your door. My 
grandfather, you see ... and the ten teacups and then, oh, the blood, I ... ' 
<P>Her hand flew up to her brow as her body began to fall forward, and at that 
moment I leapt to her side just in time to stop her from collapsing into a pile 
of half-empty biscuit packets. 
<P>Rapley stared on impassively as I helped her to a stool propped against the 
wall. 
<P>'What a wonderful start,' he drawled, 'I'll take the case. Mr Violet, fetch 
the poor woman some Ribena while she starts at the very beginning.' 
<P>'I live in Sevenoaks with my Mother, Grandfather and, of course, a 
skeleton staff of servants. You may think it antiquated of us. However, that is 
the way we live. I am, by nature, a homemaker. An oddity in these liberated 
times.' 
<P>Miss Menzies lowered her head, expecting, perhaps, some argument. I felt it 
my duty to meet the young woman's expectations. 
<P>'An oddity! The very idea! You're as normal as the rest of us!' And I even 
clapped my thigh at the absurdity. 
<P>Rapley perked up. 
<P>'Normal? Christ, I hope not. A squashed pigeon on the South Circular is 
normal. An itchy groin is normal. A beautiful young woman muttering about blood 
and ten teacups is decidedly something else. You were saying.' 
<P>'We live in the family home in a sheltered area of countryside. It is a 
picturesque spot. Not exactly isolated, but certainly left to its own devices. 
The incident happened last Thursday. I had an engagement chairing the 
inaugural meeting of our amateur dramatics association, while my Grandfather 
was hosting one of his rare social gatherings. 
<P>'He is housebound?' enquired my friend. 
<P>'Yes. Or rather, he was.' At this, Miss Menzies paused to wipe at her eye 
with the cuff of her blouse. 
<P>'I take it he hasn't miraculously regained his health and is, even as we 
speak, leaping euphorically across the fine fields of Kent?' 
<P>'No. He is, as I'm sure you have surmised, dead. I arrived home to find 
my Mother hammering on 
the door to my Grandfather's wing. I should explain that my Grandfather had lived in 
the house for all of his 80 years and had the whole east wing entirely to 
himself. Our entrance to it is by a single connecting door which leads directly 
to his dining room. My Mother was hysterical and, between sobs, explained that 
she had only just returned to the house when she heard a piercing yell coming 
from my Grandfather's rooms, where he was due to be entertaining a number of old 
acquaintances. Since then, she had been beating on the door fruitlessly for some 
minutes. We managed to rouse Mr Lambeth, the butler, and he presently came to 
our assistance.' 
<P>'You said you had to rouse him. Did he sleep through the commotion?' 
interjected Rapley as he jotted in a Paddington Bear notebook. 
<div class=pullquote>Our recently acquired white Fiesta scudded to a stop outside Crystal Palace library</div>

<P>'Mr Lambeth had been given the night off by my Grandfather and was ... I 
believe the correct expression would be "sleeping it off" when we woke him. He 
was slurring and straight lines seemed alien to him, so I can vouch for his 
incapacity if you are suspecting him of putting it on for an alibi.' 
<P>Rapley nodded. 'That was to be my next question. But continue.' 
<P>'Mr Lambeth is a hardy man and, pulling himself together as best he could, 
he broke the door down with a series of shoulder charges.' 
<P>Miss Menzies stopped and pushed her chin upwards, most prettily, I may add, 
as she steeled her inner courage to tell her story. 
<P>'Inside we found my Grandfather. His throat had been cut, a dreadful white 
foam also lay upon his lips. He was seated at the large dining table. In all, 
ten seats were set around with ten place settings and ten teacups, nine of which 
were half full with tea, still steaming mildly and hot to the touch. My 
Grandfather's cup was empty. Of his guests, there was no trace. Except, in the 
middle of the table, next to a tray containing a teapot, a milk jug and spoons, 
there was a postcard of Paris- a normal busy street scene- with the reverse side 
left blank. No message, no address, no stamp. The other connecting door from the 
room, which led to my Grandfather's drawing room, was also locked, and his keys remained in 
the ticket pocket of his waistcoat.' 
<P>Rapley scratched both ears at the same time. 'Any other way in or out?' 
<P>'A window, locked, shuttered, curtains drawn. The panes intact, unlike the 
shattered glass of our family, which lies br-' 
<P>'Yes, yes.' Muttered my good friend with the impatience of one who wishes to 
get to the last page of a book. 'This is a mare's nest and no mistake. We will help 
you, Mr Violet and I. We shall of course need to see the house itself and ask 
further, hopefully revealing, questions of the entire <i>dramatis personae</i>. You 
have a car?' 
<P>Miss Menzies shook her fine head. 'Your associate met me off the Sevenoaks train.' 
<P>Rapley looked at me, his head cocked to one side. 'Violet, old pal. Steal a car.' 
<P>I was glad to be of use. 
<P><p class=drop>Having procured suitable transport, we began the journey to the suburban hum 
of Sevenoaks. 
<P>Less than a minute into our travels, however, Rapley abruptly piped up. 
<P>'We must make a stop!' he whinnied, pausing from brushing the broken glass 
off the back seat. 
<P>I glanced at him in the rearview as he pronounced the interim destination as 
if it had seventeen syllables. 
<P>'The librrrrrary!' 
<P>His rolled R's made the word an incantation. I stifled tears of respect for 
the man. 
<P>Our recently acquired white Fiesta scudded to a stop outside Crystal Palace library, Rapley 
leaping out even before the car had stopped its motion. In the flash of a gun 
muzzle, he was through the double doors and riffling through shelves of reference 
material, framed by the long side windows of what was 
possibly the least appealing repository of knowledge in the western world. 
<P>Miss Menzies sat stiff and self-conscious in the passenger seat.
She looked straight ahead, seemingly oblivious to everything but the 
guilt-inducing fact that she was encased in a purloined motor vehicle. 
<P>The shame that her guilt imposed upon me, dear reader, was piercing and 
unquestionable, and it was all I could do to stop myself from throwing my body 
at her feet and crying out an impassioned apology. Yet, as an Englishman, I 
instead changed the subject from the one occupying our mutual thoughts. 
<P>'Pasha Rapley believes in the mind, Miss Menzies ... ' 
<P>She lowered her head slightly, a crease tracked her brow. 
<P>' ... he sees the brain as overused. Good for a crossword or a mathematical 
exercise, but not, you see, for a mystery. A mystery, he believes, does not have corners or slots or decimal 
points, but instead has feelings and bad days. Patterns of thought and behaviour 
that evolve and ... and ...  well, it is clearer when he explains it himself ... ' 
<P>Her face had turned to the side window, through which she gazed blankly. 
<P>'My life has a corner, Mr Violet. It has turned that corner, and I see no 
path back.' 
<P>I puffed up my cheeks with air, as if to say 'Well, quite.', but, somehow, 
it didn't seem to be the right thing to do. 
<P>So, I dismounted from the vehicle and lit a Consulate cigarette with a Zippo and 
a well-practised click of the fingers. 
<P>A minute passed. I smoked. Miss Menzies gazed through the quarterlight 
window, trying to find solace in the gaudy neon decrepitude of a 'Whumpies' 
burger restaurant across the way. At least, she was staring directly at it. To 
be perfectly frank, in her present state of blank absence, I fear she could have 
been staring at the crotch of an aroused hippopotamus and she would not have 
registered the sight. 
<P>And then, with a sneeze and a frantic dashing of legs, Rapley bowled through 
the library doors, his thick scarf trailing behind him like the furious black 
smoke of some terrible engine of the intellect. 
<P>Rapley shot into the back seat of the car, smiling round his nose at Miss 
Menzies as I climbed into the driver's seat. 
<P>'Synchronicity', he said, 'Is a long word for stupid luck. There are links 
with the seasons and, oh, other stuff that won't currently make sense to any of 
us. These-', and here he indicated an armful of leatherbound hardbacks, '-are 
stolen library books! Drive, Mr Violet! Drive!' 
<P>I have never heard a woman snivel before, at least not in such a dejected 
manner, and so, to drown out the noise, I floored the accelerator. 
<P>The Fiesta flew down Gypsy Hill, rattling like a skeleton in a storm.     
<P>The rest of the journey passed without undue conversation. 
<P>Miss Menzies lifted and lowered her head from time to time, (with great 
visual effect, I may add) whilst Rapley rustled pages, occasionally murmuring 
phrases such as 'Well, those sly old dogs.', much to my mystification. 
<P>At his insistence, I had inserted one of his tape cassettes into the car 
stereo, and we sped towards Sevenoaks in the company of the inopportune surges 
of David Bowie's 'Always crashing in the same old car.' 
<P>And then, with a froth of green leaves rushing past us, we reached the edges 
of the Kent countryside. 
<P><p class=drop>The car rolled gratefully to a stop on the front lawn of the 
Menzies residence, a looming, well-spread, grey-brick house of a certain age, two gargoyles 
watching from the corners of the roof, faces frozen halfway between snarls and 
yawns. 
<P>Miss Menzies led us to the heavy oak door and slid a brass key into the mortice
lock. 
<P>As I entered, I glanced back at Rapley, who trailed a short distance behind 
me. 
<P>He had acquired a cat, a small tabby kitten, which lay cradled and purring 
in the plastic hammock of his folded, macintosh-clad arms. 
<P>' ... he says his name is Horace.' , muttered Pasha. 
<P>The oak door swung to a satisfied, sealed rest, and we were inside. 
<P>Miss Menzies sighed herself onto a wicker chair in the hallway, while I cast 
my eyes around the lattice work of family portraits which lined the darkly 
varnished, gloaming wooden walls. Wolfish grins, sailors' hats on gurning 
children, admirals' hats atop naval adults, square-jawed maiden aunts of an 
industrial size and quantity, the squirming, swivelling eyes of the richly mad. 
All peered down at the three of us. Myself gulping somewhat at the attention, 
Miss Menzies cloaked in her own inner turmoil, and Rapley. 
<P>Rapley raised an eyebrow, then let another one join the club. He sat the 
kitten in the palm of one hand and held it up, scanning it in front of the 
family portraits. 
<P>'Look what you could have become, Horace. Lucky escape, thank your stars you 
never made it up a tree like the rest of us.' 
<P>He knelt in front of Miss Menzies like a suitor. 
<P>'The room, if you please. The cat comes too.' 
<P>Another door opened, another room revealed ... Jago Menzies, eighty years of 
age, a widower, late of Northern Kent, died here in this brown, square salon of 
velvet, brass and leather, in this mysterious circumstance. 
<P>The room had a sterling, musty, masculine quality to it. A thick brown rug 
of colonial vintage, a cowhide five seater couch along one wall, ranks of 
bookshelves along another, stacked to the ceiling with dense volumes, spines 
adorned with brass clasps and tattooed with calligraphy of an Arabian flavour. 
<P>In the middle, an oblong slab of mahogany on legs lay festooned with tea 
things, trays, jugs and plates, crumbs, knives and a bowl of plums. 
<P>Of Miss Menzies' late, lamented Grandpapa, there was but one trace: a chalk 
outline on the floor by the table's edge at a strange, unreal angle, the body 
squashed and foreshortened to an impossibly concertina-ed dimension. 
<P>Rapley dangled his eyes over the outline. 
<P>'Odd shape, was he?' he said without looking up. 
<P>'His body was still slumped back in his chair when we found him' whispered 
Miss Menzies,' he had evidently started to fall backwards in it  ... but his toes 
had caught on the edge of the table, leaving him teetering, but balanced. The 
police felt, in the interests of verisimilitude, that they should mark him as 
they discovered him.' 
<P>As I took this in, I found that I had unconsciously leant forward on my 
tiptoes to view the result upon my own shadow. 
<P>A glance to my left alerted me to the fact that my good friend was likewise 
inclined. 
<P>I coughed discreetly. We both ever-so-slowly rocked back onto the flats of 
our feet. 
<P>Horace skirted the chalked-out volume, pawing the air at invisible trouser 
legs. 
<P>'Ah' said Rapley, leaning over into the middle of the table like a wading 
bird. 
<P>His slender fingers closed around a postcard. It displayed a Parisian scene, 
a market in full Sunday commerce, a high, almost blade-like steeple dominating 
the skyline behind. 
<P>Saint Bougeries, a 14th century suburb of Paris, once a hotbed of Huguenot sympathies 
and over the centuries a seedbed of various occult splinter groups, also 
exceedingly well-known for maintaining a class of the saltiest and most willing 
of all prostitutes. Rather a lot of beds, then.' 
<P>He flourished the postcard like an ace. Miss Menzies stared at him with eyes 
containing the faintest traces of hope. I folded my arms and chewed a bottom 
lip. The kitten walked into a table leg, and was suitably embarrassed. 
<P>'You are of course aware that it is winter! That fact may not have escaped 
you, but were you also aware that one half of a century ago, a group of 
prodigiously talented students of the dark, magical arts convened in a filthy garret on the Rue Barnacle in St 
Bougeries to attempt one of the all-time great crackerjack magical workings, one 
whose ambition and complexity was matched only by the lunacy of its intent?' 
<P>'No.' stated Miss Menzies and I in unison, unnecessarily. 
<P>'Well, they did, so there. And they numbered ten ... ', and here he brandished 
a hardback volume from the library. A thickish tile-red' book, battered with character, 
the dark Gill Sans type imprinted upon the cover spelt 'Les Ten&egrave;bres 
d'Illumination, une memoire de Paris , 1943-1960' 
<P>'Bernard Popin, Jeffrey D'Escale, Mimette Moinier, Al Reveillier, Dustin 
Monk, Pearl Brown, Jean Curie Piringe, Percival Bunting, Rance Cole ... and one 
Jago Sage Festivale Menzies.' 
<P>Miss Menzies' porcelain hands flew up to her porcelain throat. 
<P>'Grandfather! B-but what were their intentions?' 
<P>The kitten leapt up onto the table, landing with a clatter in the tin butter 
dish. 
<P>'The Working of the Variant Golem!' 
<P>A brace of blank faces triggered an explanation from Rapley. 
<P>'These ten fine minds had trawled the grimoires of medieval clerics and 
pagan witches, of Ostramandian adepts and Wiccan priestesses, magickal 
spellbooks from  Egypt to Leeds in their search for a specific revelation, a 
recipe for producing living, breathing, thinking copies of oneself! Golems! 
Doppelgangers! Claypoles! Mirror Kin! D'Escale, Moinier and Popin were the 
money, minor French aristocrats with a penchant for the shocking, whose daddies, 
no doubt, simply didn't understand them; Reveillier and Monk, the movers, men of 
the world who could open all doors with a strong arm or a silver tongue; Cole 
and Piringe, hangers on, mere adepts on the first rungs of the magickal ladders, 
making up the numbers, snotty nosed but eager. Which leaves us with Bunting, 
Brown and Menzies. The knowledge.' 
<P>'Why, this is ridiculous!' I said, more to hurry things along than from any 
true sense of disbelief. 'Why would they wish to produce such ... unnatural 
specimens?' 
<P>'Oh ... ', began Rapley, with a rueful shrug, 'It had never been done before in 
such extravagant abundance. Ten identical copies of the participants. A feat 
bound for any books of records. And also, of course,  the egotistical mind 
fancies the arse off itself ... I once had an aunt who painted. Countless 
watercolours, terrible pieces of tat, but only of herself, face and shoulders 
with a thick slice of summer light illuminating the right side of her face. I 
asked her why, and she told  me "I have perfect dextral facial geometry, it 
deserves the limelight. I cry if I don't capture each lunar phase of my 
physiognomy as it passes through the arc of my life".Mad as a rat. Ended her 
days living down a manhole on the Edgware Road. The point is that the St 
Bougeres collective were working to replicate their ideas, their brains, their 
minds, their bodies, their biases, hatreds, loves, foibles, talents and 
prowesses; to create a breed of their own. Who knows ... maybe they wanted to go 
fuck themselves as well.' 
<P>Miss Menzies glared from under her finely plucked eyebrows, her delicate 
voice a-tremble like a vibrato-ed harp string. 
<P>'Your language, Mr Rapley! Is it not enough that my logical faculties are 
under assault from this fantastical tale ... Must my sensibilities be similarly 
assaulted by such cursing?' 
<P>'I apologise for the blueness of the verb.' 
<P>He bowed low and long, then straightened, his face serious and set. 
<P>'That is the background to the matter. And it brings us to the present.' 
<P>He circled the table, drumming his long fingers on the edge as he went. 
<P>'Ten teacups, one body, no murder weapon, though he had undoubtedly been 
both poisoned and throated. And no way out. ' 
<P>He threw himself down onto the baggy leather couch, which hissed and settled 
underneath him; then he turned to address Miss Menzies and myself,. 
<P>'You see, I know the how, and I could have a pretty darn good stab at the 
who, but the why is too vague, too hazy.' 
<P>Rapley pulled a mint from a trouser pocket and offered the pack around. 
<P>'No? Suit yourselves. I wonder how he made them disappear, and also whether 
they've disappeared for good. It would be a damnable shame if they were to 
continue blistering this continuum.' 
<P>Miss Menzies rose slowly from her chair, keeping her eyes lowered to the 
chalk outline. 
<P>'You talk in riddles, sir. They? Do you refer to these phantasms? Or have I 
lost myself in this delirium of mirror people ... perhaps you mean the nine woman-
born real people who assisted my grandfather in this madness? My ship of thought 
requires a lighthouse in this fog.' 
<P>'Oh, don't fool yourself into thinking of these golems as unreal, Miss 
Menzies. They are, or were, as real and as solid as you or I. It is simply that 
they were poured from a different spout.' 
<P><p class=drop>Horace mewed softly towards the bookcase. 
<P>'Look', I chuckled, appreciating the whimsy amid all the dark talk, 'The 
cat's clawing the air, he has yet to grow into his paws. It rather makes me 
think of a child wearing boxing gloves ... ' 
<P>Miss Menzies looked up, and smiled a most appreciative and angelic smile at, 
first, the cat, and then at me. 
<P>I mopped my brow, my thoughts  unseasonably hot. 
<P>Air motes crackled in the late afternoon gloom. The windows let in grey 
dying light. 
<P>A bird squawked from the branch of a spindly tree on the other side of the 
pane and then threw itself hurriedly into the air, flapping madly as if it were 
an umbrella tossed off a cliff. 
<P>Rapley slowly turned his head towards the bookshelves, his eyes expanding 
and briefly popping with thought. He spoke one word. 
<P>'Milk.' 
<P>The smile flew away more softly from Miss Menzies' face, a dove silently 
disappearing into a calm summer sky. 
<P>'Mr Rapley ... ?' 
<P>'MILK!!!' Yelled Rapley, leaping to the tips of his toes, hopping around the 
table, scattering tea things as he lanced his hand to the centre of the table 
and grabbed a grand two pint milkjug shaped like a mooing Fresian. 
<P>He spun back round to face the bookshelf, picked the cat up smartly by the 
scruff of the neck and deposited the mewling feline onto a chair with a soft 
plod. 
<P>I took Miss Menzies by the shoulders and pulled her to one side as my good 
friend drew back his arm and hurled the milk jug at the array of books with a 
yell of 'Here's mud in your eye!' 
<P>The jug smashed roughly against the brickwork wall behind the books, shards of china clinking into the 
air and against the floor, yellowing spats of old milk dotting the air like fat 
from a fried egg. 
<P>Before Miss Menzies could arrange her obvious shock and distress into 
anything verbal, Rapley had bounded to the bookcase and shoved his head amongst 
the books, squashing his face up against the wall behind. 
<P>He came away with a light quiff of dust and a broad grin. 
<P>'The milk has sunk into the wall, my friends, we have our quarry in our 
sights!' 
<P>He brandished a magician's hand towards the brick wall which was visible behind the
bookcase. Where there should have been a dripping pool of thick, sour milk, there was 
instead a thin cleft between the bricks 
into which the flung dairy substance had entered, splashes on either side 
showing the passage of entry. 
<P>Miss Menzies gathered her wits and cocked her head to one side. 
<P>'Th-there is something behind there ... ?' 
<P>Rapley began to yank books from the shelves like a demented dentist. 
<P>'A secret room and a secret guest, I should fancy ... Here, help me with these 
books, there must be a lever attached to one of them.' 
<P>Myself and Miss Menzies leapt to his aid, pulling volumes from their oak 
beds. 
<P>'Binary exercises in Calamity', 'Forces Majeures de Loki', 'Skulls for 
Beginners', 'Cryptohagiography in an Age of Pigs', all went whistling through 
the air, clapping into a plump pile on the far side of the room. 
<P>My hand closed around a thick, maroon copy of 'The Enchanted Station', and I 
immediately felt a ponderous tug of resistance. 
<P>'I-I have it ... ' Said I. And for one ripe second we all froze. 
<P>'Then pull, Mr Violet, pull as you've never pulled before.' hissed Pasha 
Rapley. 
<P>And so I pulled. 
<P>The book began to inch slowly away from the wall, then the bottom of the 
outward-facing spine locked up and with a low, vibrating, metallic grind the top 
of the tall volume started to arc down towards the shelving. 
<P>As the weighty tome tipped forward, we peered in to see what resembled a 
crankshaft and gear system hidden underneath, thin rusty links of chain 
disappearing into narrow holes in the wall, as taut as rictus grins. 
<P>With one final heave the book clumped flat on the shelf and, with a sound 
like the flapping of mighty wooden wings, the book shelf unceremoniously shunted 
a foot towards us, scattering the three of us like frightened mice, and then 
slowly began to open outwards like the fat door of knowledge it unquestionably 
was.
<div class=lpullquote>He wore a velvet suit, close-cut and deeply unfashionable, dark green and 
purple stripes running from ankle to collar. A loose black tie puffed up from 
between white shirt collars</div>
<P>It creaked open on heavy hinges, releasing an obscuring gloom onto our eyes 
and a lurid tang of sharply acidic gas into our nostrils. The dread and 
anticipation in my heart was simply monstrous. 
<P>We stood in a line against the opposite wall, peering into the darkness. A 
firing line without weaponry, praying for a small, weak target, but fearing 
something quite other. 
<P>'Um. We're here to help ... ?' tried Rapley. 
<P>Tendrils of egg white smoke curled into the air, slowly unfurling 
themselves like a waking beast. 
<P>A shape quivered and breathed in the demi-light of the hidden room. Tall, 
rangy, angle-limbed. It coughed laughter, sniffled liquidly. 
<P>Rapley took one step forward, then swivelled back round to face us. In his 
hands were a metal poker from the fireplace and a fork from the table.     
<P>'If he begins to froth at the mouth,' he whispered, handing us each an 
implement, 'or if his eyes start rolling in different directions, hit him in the 
balls.' 
<P>Some inner rod of steel tensed inside Miss Menzies as she closed her fingers 
around the handle of the fork. 
<P>'Yes, Mr Rapley. In the balls.' 
<P>Rapley spun back round to face the music. He snapped his heels together and 
ran his flat palms down the front of his mackintosh, smoothing his hair back as 
an afterthought. 
<P>'Mr Bunting? Percy? It is Percival Bunting, isn't it?' 
<P>All three of us walked slowly towards the entrance of the hidden room 
keeping a triangular formation, Rapley at the apex. 
<P>A dark, shaking shambles of a figure tottered from the gloom, wreathed in 
parasitically clinging whorls of gas, spiralling smoke rags and furious 
miniature constellations of dust particles. 
<P>The man was above average height, of advanced years, his once matinee-idol 
cheekbones and high, distinguished brow reduced to mere pegs upon which to hang 
the sagging features of his face. 
<P>A pair of greasy, nocturnal moustaches played out a dark tragedy on his 
upper lip, and his balding, liverspotted head was punctuated by the sharp, 
greying prow of a widows peak. 
<P>He wore a velvet suit, close-cut and deeply unfashionable, dark green and 
purple stripes running from ankle to collar. A loose black tie puffed up from 
between white shirt collars. 
<P>Signs of disrepair were immediately apparent: holes in cuffs, moth-snack 
lapels, stains of a darkness found only at the bottom of the ocean, a gloopy run 
of dribble caked one side of his mouth. His shoes were sighing bags of leather. 
<P>'Please.forgive my appearance', Percival Bunting attempted a creaking bow, 
'If I'd have known I'd be... receiving guests so soon, I would have been 
more rigorous in my grooming..' 
<P>A red mist stormed through Miss Menzies as she leapt forward, brandishing a 
crumpet fork in an alarming manner. 
<P>'You ... you ... fiend! What did you do to poor grandpapa ... ? His 
throat ... Oh ... Devilry!' 
<P>'Violet! Grab her, man!' Shouted Rapley as we both lunged after her. But, as 
the saying surely goes, a woman scorned should not be armed, and the blur of her 
arm raced past our optimistic fingertips, burying the business end of the fork 
in Bunting's right breast with a muffled 'fud'. 
<P>Miss Menzies stood panting heavily, glaring at the tottering rou&#130;, myself 
and Rapley to either side of her. 
<P>Percival Bunting briskly looked down at the protuberance and twanged the 
embedded handle with a wrinkled, meaty finger. 
<P>'Oh now, please. To be blooded by such a vanquished beauty may make the 
pulse leap in a younger mans loins, but I am made of older and starker 
material.' 
<P>He fixed the young lady with a ghostly, cataract stare and leant in to share 
the breath of a dead thing. 
<P>'I am a beast of an inordinately different stripe.' 
<P>Rapley leant his own head forward till their brows touched. 
<P>'You are Percival Bunting. Magician, gentleman and murderer. Unless I'm very 
much mistaken ... ' 
<P>Bunting and Rapley remained brow-to-brow, the older, taller man's expression 
softened to one of cordial sincerity as his eyes met Rapley's. 
<P>'You have me at a disadvantage, sir. By whom 
have I the pleasure of being unlaired?'  
<P>'Rapley. Of Herne Hill,' smiled my friend, pleasantly. 
<P>Foreheads still meeting, the two strange fellows had began to slowly revolve 
together like a dancing couple,  carefully mirroring each others discreet and 
soundless feline footsteps as they discoursed. 
<P>'I am still disadvantaged, but the pleasure, of course, remains. Indeed, it 
glows ever more tantalisingly in the oxygen of my fascination. May I ask your 
interest in this matter?' 
<P>The <I>pas-de-deux</I> continued with almost infinite grace and courtesy. 
<P>'Professional. The lady whose Grandfather you murdered has 
engaged my colleague and me in attaining a solution to the crime. May 
we sit? And talk?' 
<P>A pause in the music of their intimacy. Their dance ended. Percival Bunting 
leant back, raising himself with aged effort to something approaching his full 
height. A muscle in his cheek twitched once and something coughed and gurgled 
inside his throat. 
<P>'Hrrumphgh... ahhm ... Yes. An explanation. Very well.' 
<P>Licks of smoke still drifted lazily across the room, a slight 
smell of gas still hazed the atmosphere, grazing on any slow thoughts it might 
find. It would find none in the minds of Bunting and Rapley. 
<P>The tall man turned his gaze to me, scanning his eyes up and down with his 
mouth ajar in a way that made me think of lizards. 
<P>I fingered the poker behind my back and nodded to a dining chair. 
<P>'After you,' said I to the old man, showing my teeth. 
<P>'Naturally,' said he, showing his and folding himself down onto the seat. 
<P>Rapley took up a seat opposite. I and Miss 
Menzies - all her passion temporarily spent - lowered ourselves onto the sofa. The 
cat was nosing the entrance to the hidden room, flame tail a-flicker. 
<P>Rapley's attention was locked onto the older man like 
scaffolding. 
<P>'Tell me why you killed him. And who else attended this little 
soir&eacute;e,' he instructed. 
<P>Bunting raised his eyebrows in a display of indignation at such effrontery, 
flared nostrils of pride telling Rapley he'd need to try a different tack. 
<P>' ... or start wherever you wish and drivel on until we get the picture ... ' 
<P><p class=drop>The murderer's face relented and he began his tale. 
<P>'I gather you're aware of my reputation and standing in the magical 
community, but for the benefit of your manservant and the hormonal woman, let me 
circle the main points. I conversed with Aiwass at the age of 13, my guardian 
angel and the rudderman on this haunted frigate we call existence. This early 
translation of abstract thought into actual experience made me aware of how 
little the common man tastes of life. The meat and gristle and plasma doesn't 
get stuck in his teeth, as it were. I decided to chew upon life, and to never 
let it chew back. Consensus reality is a dog to be eviscerated and hung upon the 
walls of public buildings, its entrails assuming new darker forms. New 
arrangements. Physical graffiti.' 
<P>The air thickened in the room, the smoke trails seemed to organise 
themselves into small, shimmering forms as Bunting spoke. An outline of a 
building was visible if I squinted, a sense of vaguely human shapes walking and 
laughing and gesturing with puffs of hands. 
<P>'Washed up in St Bougeries in fifty seven, sharp jags of cocaine in the 
bloodstream, even sharper plans behind my eyes. I fell in with a bunch of 
frenchies, yanks and even fellow countrymen. Some more talented than others, I'm 
thinking of Pearl here. Poor, exquisite Pearl ... ' 
<P>Though Bunting's eyes dampened at his memories, his smile belonged to a 
feasting shark. The smoke coalesced like coral to form the face of a somewhat 
haughty, yet undeniably attractive, young woman, wearing Pre-Raphaelite curls 
and a bow tie. She proffered a hand towards Bunting, her fingers raw and ridged 
with burns, her wrists bangled with scars. 
<P>' ... but I'm ahead of myself. There were ten of us; some had heard of the 
others; some were attracted by the glamour of the intent; some such as dear, 
sweet, vicious Al, and that odious, gurning thug Mr Monk simply had jobs to do, 
dirty francs to earn. Monk, for his whores, mainly. GI's that had remained in 
France had a particular cachet among the authorities and local girls, you see. 
Who cared if a couple went missing every now and then. Not the mayor, not with 
his syphilitic secrets and morphine mishaps, certainly. And, I suppose, not I. I 
had finer preoccupations. With the incantations formulated and the science in 
place ... ' 
<P>Here, he looked around at all three of us with gravity. 
<P>' ... for we were scientists, after all, and this was to be mankind's greatest 
experiment. The atoms that make up any given physical form, including that of 
the human being, are vibrating at an extraordinary rate, and in utter 
disharmony. If a structure of atoms could be encouraged through incantation, 
force, legerdemain or any other method to organise themselves into a willing 
herd which moves in one specified direction, then you have form, and more 
importantly, form that operates entirely at one's will. This was the sound yet 
admittedly experimental basis for our work. Sympathetic magick provided the 
ignition key.' 
<P>The blue smoke forms drifted again and rearranged themselves into the ten 
figures of Bunting's recollections. About the size of Action Men, they bobbed in 
the air, sitting in a circle around a vast metal urn, symbols and crescents 
carved into its sides. They were all quite naked except for various jewels and 
crystals which glinted cold and obsidian, their bodies glistened with oils and 
sweat, and one of them, a burly brute I took to be the man Monk, was floating 
directly in front of Miss Menzies and me, his vast rump displayed to us in all 
its inglory. I felt my bones turn to ice. 
<P>Rapley seemed to be wearing the nebulous figure of Pearl Brown as a hat, and 
rather enjoying the experience. 
<P>'We snipped at our hair and nails, pricked our addled veins for spurts of 
precious blood, spat and hawked thick gobbets into the crucible, spoke our 
wildest prayers and most savage fantasies and threw them into the cooking pot 
for good measure. Our DNA roosted inside the iron womb, boiling in the amniotic 
broth of our confessions and sins. We had begun.' 
<P>The air suddenly turned violent with smudges of incident and movement. 
Thicknesses of smoke suddenly thinned into screaming faces, before they vanished 
in a ragged swirl of trace tracks; over Buntings shoulder, a great 
stream of bubbling liquid splashed down onto the floor of the 
room before hissing upwards into a veil of nothingness. 
<P>'Pearl, your learned Grandfather and I had prepared our work well. Our science was 
impeccable, our magical research exhaustive, our approach rigorous. Of course 
chaos ensued. Once conjured, our Variant Golems slewed themselves from the 
crucible like sausage meat squeezed from the skin. They were raw and squealing 
in the half-light, ragged red and oozing something like tar from their orifices. 
All ten of us were suspended between horror and a godlike curiosity at our 
emerging flock. These creatures' bodies and faces adjusted themselves in 
shimmers, waves and contractions, seemingly adjusting to the ten of us as irises 
adjust to harsh light. In a matter of minutes we were presented with ten 
identical ... versions ... of ourselves. Albeit versions which appeared to have been 
run over by a fleet of rickshaws.' 
<P>A red illumination spread through the smoke wraiths in the air, ten bloodied 
and animalistic men and women stood like flesh statues, panting and crying 
softly. 
<P>'They turned on us. Whether from hunger, disappointment, rage or some primal 
destructive urge, I simply do not know. I saw Popin and Mimette Moinier 
thrashing wildly like landed fish as their counterparts from beyond dragged them 
into a shadowy corner. I heard them scream and gurgle their last words. Piringe 
and Cole were consumed by the explosion from a gas lamp hurled at them by their 
alter egos. The fire 
spread as Jago, a man I had always held in some esteem, muttered some words of 
wisdom from a sheaf of notes on the sideboard, lopped his doppelganger in half 
with a shattered wall mirror and leapt through a window onto the street below. 
It must have been two storeys, a most commendable effort. 
D'Escale dived into the crucible to escape the conflagration, I daren't think 
whether he drowned or found himself in some regressed hellish world of torment 
under those supernatural waves. I didn't see Dustin Monk die, merely his head in 
pieces. Alvin Reveiller succumbed to a rain of drillhammer punches, struggling 
valiantly to the end . I protected Pearl as best as could, I fought like a 
panther, but...' 
<P>Percival Bunting's nails were scratching deep ruts in the wooden tabletop as 
he paused. 
<P>'They caught up with me thirty two years later in Cairo. By this time, they 
seemed almost civilised. They wore the clothes of civility, I should say. Their 
conversation, peppered with bon mots, aphorism and received knowledge, could 
have passed as sparkling, were it not for the dribbling, rampant coughing and 
porcine squeals which they were, alas, unable to prevent from adversely 
colouring their speech. The Percival Bunting of their world was clearly their 
leader, they deferred to him with respect. Perhaps our worlds were not so very 
different in some ways.They needed my help. Their research into the mystery of 
their existence had led them to the knowledge that their precarious, spluttering 
physical bodies had a half-life of some fifty years, if their calculations were 
accurate,  after which their atomic masses would become fatally unstable. My 
double looked me in the eyes and pleaded with me to help them, begged me to help 
save my own spectral twin. The experience jangled my senses ... to be staring at 
and conversing with one's own flipside made me a catalogue of nervous disorders. 
We fought. The two Percivals, tooth and claw; oddly the others stood clear, with 
soft grins of approval at this obscene contest. 
<P>'I left him dead. His throat slit. I would not say they accepted me as their 
leader after that day, but they certainly tolerated me and respected my 
knowledge and ideas. How could they not? They needed me.' 
<P>With a start, I noticed that although Bunting's hand had risen from the 
table to cup his chin, his index finger had remained on the tabletop, nail 
embedded in the oak. Bunting's cloudy eyes swept over the abandoned digit once, 
and without missing a beat he folded his four-fingered hand inside his jacket 
and pulled a doily over the finger. 
<P>'With their talent for forcefully acquiring information and resources, I 
soon amassed a wealth of knowledge on the subject of atomic principles and the 
depth of my occult learnings deepened commensurately. Through the years, I began 
to assess them without fear, and they became to me pitiful creatures, whose 
primal brains and appetites would never let them rise above their base and 
unholy origins. I no longer felt fear, just revulsion at their iniquity and 
inferiority. 
<P>'They kept me close, the threat of violence unspoken but ever present. I may 
have killed one of their kind, but I was clear-sighted enough to realise that 
they were united against me, and that any further action against them on my part 
would be met by the most brutal acts of retaliation.' 
<P>A gentle cloud of gas puffed out from his right ear, bobbed a few feet then 
popped like a spore. 
<P>'I researched and delved into the sciences for ways to prolong their lives, 
showing them my workings and discoveries at every juncture. However, at the same 
time, I researched ways to prematurely terminate their existences. 
<P>'It took twelve years of furtive learning, but eventually I collated enough 
information to ascertain that a certain series of ancient glamours, spoken aloud 
and inserted into the reversed names of these savage creatures, would erase them 
from this life forever, if one utilised the correct emphases and mantras. 
<P>'One piece of information escaped me. One piece to make these instructions 
complete ... A nugget of knowledge I suspected your Grandfather possessed, making 
it vital that we tracked him down. 
<P>'I also suspected that this spell might, if different emphases were stressed, 
result in the indefinite extension of their lives. And, of course, this was the 
version of the truth which I proffered to my bestial companions. The trap set, 
they focussed their energies and resources to the tracking down of Jago Sage 
Festivale Menzies.' 
<P>Bunting creakingly rose from his chair and walked over to the window. The 
sky outside was the deepest and darkest of blues, and it seemed to be that we 
were all encased in some Victorian submarine, at the mercy of terrible undersea 
pressures. 
<P>A loud hiss sounded from his midriff and Bunting appeared to lose 
three inches of height, his knees met and he tipped up onto his toes, grabbing the wall 
for support. 
<P>'Harruffgh ... mrrgh ... uhhm.ah, yes ... Two days ago, we arrived here en masse. 
Duping Menzies that we were envoys from the Nobel Committee come to service him 
for his gifts to the experimental Sciences. Papers, I'm sure I needn't tell you, 
that he had submitted under an assumed name. The shock of our appearance was 
overwhelming, all those memories must have fled back and caused him to seek an 
ending to the nightmare he had initiated fifty years ago. He shakingly made a 
pot of tea for us all, and this we attributed to his gentlemanly manners. 
However, when he started foaming at the mouth and spluttering for air, it 
occurred to me that he must have poisoned the beverage in an attempt to kill 
himself and the Golems. They, being made of tougher stuff, digested the poison 
with ease and comfort. 
<P>'With his dying breath, Menzies imparted to me the final key, the missing 
piece of the spell which I knew he had in his knowledge. Those words he had so 
hastily and effectively read from his notes in that burning French garret. 
<P>'The Monk creature slashed his throat and held the razor to my own jugular. I 
was ordered to read the completed and, to their minds, restorative incantation. 
<P>'With the solemnity of a priest and the resonance of a born orator, I 
intoned the necessary spell, using the correct, life-devouring emphases. There 
was a roar like dying lions and these eight demonic fools twisted and spun into 
a blur of features. The air sucked in around them until I could scarcely 
breathe, my fillings sparked, their forms contracted and lost all semblance of 
humanity ... and then they were gone, leaving only a smell of cordite and eight 
wisps of red smoke.' 
<P>He leant against the window pane, his knees knocking together, his nine 
fingers twitching, every breath the slow turn of a wooden rattle. 
<P>Rapley hopped smartly out of his own chair and gathered up Horace, who had 
been lying on his back cycling his paws in the air. 
<P>'Well, a fine tale! But more than a little flexible with the truth, I fear!' 
<P>'Flexible, sir? Whatever do you mean?' 
<P>'Your physical disrepair, for one thing.' 
<P>'I have sweated through eighty summers, young man. I have toiled at the edge 
of things for much of that time.' 
<P>'Eighty's the new sixty, so they say.' 
<P>'It takes its toll.' 
<P>'Forgive me, but you take the piss' 
<P>Miss Menzies and I were spectators, our heads whipping back 
and forth between the two of them. 
<P>Bunting let out a tiny piglet squeal and clamped a hand over his mouth. 
<P>'I believe you when you say there were two human survivors that night in St 
Bougeries. But you weren't one of them. Your time is nearly up. 
<P>My bet is that Jago and the real Bunting escaped the fire together and 
agreed to split up, fleeing separately. Bunting was eventually hounded down to 
Cairo, where it was his blood that was spilt, not the foul concoction that runs 
through your diseased veins.' 
<P>The spectre that was previously known to us as Percival Bunting spread his 
angular arms as wide as dragons wings and bellowed an alien curse, but the effort 
of this theatrical display made him crumple to his ancient knees. 
<P>'Well, really.' said Rapley, distastefully, and knelt by his side. 
<P>'You came here with your little troupe of performing zombies ... and then ... ?' 
<P>The Bunting thing rocked from side to side. I thought it was just the 
occasion getting to me, but I could have sworn that his skin appeared to be 
melting. His voice grew thicker, as if exhausted from the effort of trying to 
escape from his throat. 
<P>'Oh ... it was true what I said. He poisoned himself, I caught his dying 
revelation ... Monk slit his throat in fury, and I killed them ... my atrophying 
brothers and sisters ... I was never one for a crowd ... and their brains and 
their ... ambitions ... simply ... never grew ... ' 
<P>He spat half a tongue onto the floor, his right trouser leg deflated, the 
limb having vanished with a sound like a cushion falling onto a sofa. 
<P>' ... they were so ... dull ... the conversation never changed ... it was all 
disembowelment and hexagrams with them ... ' 
<P>' ... and the spell to extend your half-lives?' 
<P>' ... didn't work ... I tried it, standing here like a ninny, stressing this word, 
reversing that phrase ... all that happened was that a vase of hyacinths regressed 
back into sand and seeds - it seems one can't pour any more life into these dead 
bodies of ours ... if anything it has made it worse.' 
<P>The creature blinked and when he opened his lids his eyeballs had shrunk to 
the size of peas, staring at the three of us from widening sockets. 
<P>'I didn't ask to be born ... ' , said the thick trickle of his voice. 
<P>Rapley stepped back and covered Horace's eyes. I did the same to Miss 
Menzies, but she smacked my hand away without anger. 
<P>'I must see him out, Mr Violet.' 
<P>The husk of a man on the floor shivered and swirled. With a sound of 
chattering teeth and inhuman engines, he imploded into the ether, a slowly 
turning flute of red mist in his place. 
<P><p class=drop>We dropped Miss Menzies off at the local vicarage. Her mother had spent the 
previous night there under some considerable medical sedation, and her brave, 
resolute daughter wished to be by her side. 
<P>None of us had any pressing need to trouble the police with the events of 
the day. 
<P>I waved her goodbye from the driver's seat of the Fiesta. Rapley whistled a 
toodle-pip from the back seats and then turned his attention to the pile of 
books crammed into a large Sainsburys carrier bag by his side. 
<P>'Did you ask if you could take those, old man?' said I. 
<P>He pulled the bag closer to his legs. 
<P>'Payment in kind...' He muttered. 'Buggered if I'll get out of bed for less 
than half an occult library and 
a small cat.' 
<P>Horace mewed agreement from the dashboard and licked his arsehole with 
delicate satisfaction. 
<P>I gunned the engine and flicked on the headlights. 

<P>Sparking up a cigarette, I peeked at Rapley in the rear view mirror. 

<P>A most singular fellow, I reassured myself. 
<P>It was late, and it looked like rain.

[*BLURB] Some secrets ought not to be shared.

[*DESCRIPTION]
<p class=drop>Despite himself, Leon was a little intimidated by the streamlined, palatial 
offices of Driffield Brown Pharmaceuticals. Having been approved by the 
formidable security front desk and escorted through an atrium like the main 
glasshouse at Kew Gardens and whisked up some hundreds of metres in a 
transparent elevator, shepherded by a supermodel with no conversation, he now  
found himself in a large space, two walls of which were of tinted glass, 
commanding impressive views of London and the Thames. The floor was covered with 
a thick brown velvety carpet in which the dents of his own footprints were 
clearly visible. He was perched on a black plastic and chrome chair of such 
modernity that it was barely recognisable as furniture. The chair was placed 
opposite a desk composed of a single irregular rectangle of black granite 
balanced on trestles of chrome-plated tubular steel. Behind the desk, in a 
monstrous big brother of Leon's chair, Professor Hiram Ochre, a very important 
man at Driffield Brown Pharmaceuticals, squatted like a bulbous toad. Leon had 
only met Ochre once, when his research grant was initially awarded.

Ochre's desk was completely clear except for a black cellphone as slender as a 
credit card, almost invisible against the granite, and one of these fancy 
devices that projected a holographic keyboard and screen on the desk surface. 
Professor Ochre touched one of the phantom keys on his desk, and a disembodied 
female voice trilled, "This conversation is being recorded."

"Dr Hartmann, thank you for coming to see us today," said Professor Ochre, 
without any actual appearance of gratitude. 

"It's a pleasure," lied Leon, whose mind buzzed with serious concern about the 
status of his Driffield Brown grant.

"I expect you are wondering why we called you in today. I am aware that you have 
been sending us quarterly reports on your project, and I am told that your work 
is satisfactory, if a little long-term."

Leon cleared his throat to remind the professor that a five-year clinical trial 
of a new drug was <I>necessarily</I> long-term, but Ochre silenced him with a 
gesture of his pale hand.

"I should like you to cease work on the er... work you are doing. We are not 
cancelling your research. It will be continued at a later date."

Leon felt he had to speak now. He needed the money the grant represented to pay 
his rent, grocery bills and other expenses. "But surely..." he began.

Ochre again gestured for silence and touched a corner of his keyboard. "This 
conversation is now off the record," trilled the voice of the recorder, 
"Information communicated now is secure, non-disclosable and deniable."

<div class=pullquote>sick persons all over the world will 
be healed</div>
"Dr Hartmann," said Ochre, "I am authorised to tell you that we already know 
that the drug you are testing not only does not work very well but has a number 
of embarrassing side-effects. You are conducting this trial in order to play for 
time while we develop something better, so the longer it takes for the results 
to come out, the better it is for all concerned, except, perhaps, the patients 
on the trial." Ochre then read a form of words from his holographic screen, "You 
may not disclose this information but you may use it to assist your decision-
making process now and in the future."

Leon was lost for words, choking with surprise, or shock, but before he could 
express himself, Ochre had re-activated the recorder. "This conversation is 
being recorded".

Ochre continued: "You are acquainted with Doctor Jennifer Warriston." It was not 
a question, but Leon managed to nod. "You were, in fact, ah, romantically 
involved with 
Doctor Jennifer Warriston."

"We were, yes."

"Now, this is important. Do you still harbour friendly thoughts towards her?"

"Yes, I do, but..."

"But you fear that these friendly thoughts are not reciprocated. We thought so. 
However, if you could help her, you would."

"Yes, indeed." Leon's brain was in orbit by now. What <I>was</I> this? 

"And if by helping Dr Warriston you could help Driffield Brown and help 
yourself..."

Ochre's hesitation gave Leon the opportunity to ask, "Can you just tell me 
what's going on?"

"In short", replied Ochre, "We would like you to recruit Dr Warriston. We will 
reward you well for even making the attempt, with a bonus if you succeed."

Leon weighed three facts in his mind before replying. Fact one: Jennifer 
Warriston would never work for a pharmaceutical giant - Jenny's walk-out on him 
was provoked primarily by Leon's surrender to a business she considered 
criminally immoral. Fact two: Leon would very much like to be rewarded. Fact 
three: he would like to see Jenny again. By accepting Ochre's offer, which was, 
in any event, probably one of these offers you cannot refuse, he could do 
himself some good and Jenny no harm. "I'll certainly do my best, Professor."

Ochre continued: "I am aware of the resistance Ms Warriston may feel. She is a 
principled person running her own production facility in a remote part of 
Africa, providing inexpensive pharmaceuticals for underprivileged third world 
people. We have approached her officially and been rebuffed. She would not even 
discuss the package we offered her, a package that guaranteed to maintain and 
increase her philanthropic output, while making her medicines available to all 
our customers and, incidentally, allowing her virtually unlimited funds and 
research facilities. As it is, we now sell our own drugs into these markets at a 
trifle above cost price. She's going to go out of business."

"What can I offer her that's better than the offer you have already made?"

"We believe that she distrusts us, and has not even considered our terms. You 
are to be the honest broker. We will give you the contract. You will then carry 
it to her. She will be unlikely to refuse to look at it if <strong>you</strong> 
lay it at her feet. You will find out what she really wants; we will make the 
requested changes to the contract; you will have it checked by a lawyer of your 
choice. She may perhaps accept our terms; sick persons all over the world will 
be healed; Ms Warriston will be rich, fulfilled, and grateful to you; you will 
be, at least, rich, perhaps also fulfilled, and happy; Driffield Brown will be 
more profitable."

At the time, Leon found these aspirations rather appealing. "O.K. I'll try," he 
said.


<p class=drop>Tripoli was founded by the Phoenicians, who called it Oea, at about the time 
when Homer was having his nappies changed. It was then civilized, century by 
century, by Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Turks, Italians, not necessarily in 
that order, and, eventually, by the Libyans themselves. Much of the city's 
architectural history still lurked behind the modern concrete and glass. One 
such remnant was Caf&eacute; Hassan, more of an expatriate club than the teashop 
it purported to be. Its battered frontage, eroded by time, traffic and bullets, 
carried no sign. Leon only knew he'd made it to the meeting point because his g-
phone, having guided him through a warren of alleys, told him so. The walk from 
his hotel had nevertheless been rather alarming. He was assailed in the broad 
modern streets by noisy fast traffic, most of which was propelled by big brutish 
internal combustion engines - unheard of in the oil-starved West. The few 
solarcars, with their 30kph top speed were treated like ox carts. Once in the 
souk, he had been constantly importuned by sellers of carpets, brasswork, 
oriental pleasures and hashish, so that he was baked and shredded by the time he 
stood in the doorway, nineteen minutes late.

As Leon entered the establishment, eyes glanced briefly at him and turned away. 
Only one pair of eyes met his and stayed. Leon threaded his way to a tiny table 
of wrought metal and plastic at which a thin woman was seated. Her physique and 
manner were young, but, up close, Leon realised that she must be in her fifties, 
lean and sinewy, with a lined, tanned face, grey eyes, and dressed in clean 
khaki shirt and trousers. He tried not to show surprise, but she grinned and 
said: "Hi, I'm Ray. Don't tell me. You expected your pilot to be a man." 

"I guess so. I'm Leon, Rae. I didn't have any expectation at all. I was more 
puzzled about the route I'm having to take to Chad."

"Well, as you probably already know, it's impossible for a foreigner to enter 
the country without a lot of hassle and a huge chain of bribes. If you slip up 
anywhere you could land in jail or in a ditch. It's actually quicker, cheaper 
and safer to enter illegally."

"How close can you get to where I'm going?"

"There's an airstrip and there's some route from there to the hospital. I'm 
taking supplies in quite regularly, but I've never seen the medical facility. 
You a medic, then?"

"Kind of. But it's news to me that it's a hospital. The doctor I'm visiting is a 
pharmaceutical expert. I thought she was manufacturing drugs."

"Oh, yeah, I heard that, too, but they've definitely got patients. A couple of 
Chinese medics went in a few weeks ago. Some of my passengers are mercenaries 
for the so-called freedom fighters. Not many of them make the return journey. 
White man's grave. Worse now, because of the war. But there's a steady trickle 
of patients for the hospital. There's a rumour they can cure AIDS there. The 
patients I ferry in and out are rich and sick. I think they're what's funding 
the hospital, and this trip you're making is not cheap, 'cos it ain't legal. 
Anyway, you've brought everything?"

"Yes."

"The money?" 

The money. No-one used money much these days. In London, Paris and New York, the 
only thing you could buy with actual banknotes were illegal narcotics and 
services from various freelance enterprises - chiefly bookmakers, prostitutes, 
plumbers and electricians.

The wad of US dollars that Leon handed over would have paid for a round-the-
world cruise in a luxury cabin on the QE4. Leon had wondered how Driffield Brown 
explained the cash to their accountants.

"I take it, even though this is strictly illegal, you don't anticipate any 
trouble?" Something about handing over this much cash made Leon a little 
nervous.

"We don't show up much on radar, and we don't look like a military threat. When 
I first started these trips, they scrambled a couple of Russian helicopter 
gunships to look me over. They don't bother any more. Don't worry."

"OK. I won't."

"Anyway, this is a two day trip. I'm taking you as far south as I can today. 
Then, if the weather's OK, we'll get where you're going tomorrow."

"Understood."

"Let's go, then," said Rae, leading the way out to a battered Toyota Ecojeep 
which was soaking up some solars in a nearby dusty square. "Don't know why I 
bother with this sun-bucket," she apologised, as they entered the maelstrom that 
was Tripoli traffic, "Gasoline is only ten dollars a gallon here."  It was eight 
euros a litre in London, more than fifty dollars a gallon, and it was rationed.

<p class=drop>Twenty minutes and ten near-death experiences later, they arrived at what 
appeared to be a private airfield. If Leon expected anything of Rae's aircraft, 
it would have been like something out of a 20th century thriller movie - a small 
monoplane with a single gasoline engine. The craft Rae drove him to wasn't 
remotely like that. It was dominated by its slender wing, thirty or forty metres 
in span, matt black on top, light grey below. The fuselage and tail assembly 
were hung on below the wing like an afterthought, as were a quartet of what 
looked like jet turbines. It stood on a seemingly random set of skinny 
undercarriages which supported the long wings and stubby body at various points. 

"Wow, Rae, what's this?"

"Another surprise, Leon? Meet <I>Nostromo</I>."

"Nostromo? Wasn't that the spaceship in <I>Alien</I>?"

"Yup. She's made of the lightweight stuff they make tennis racquets out of. The 
wings are photo-voltaic collectors, it's got these new lightweight batteries and 
it's entirely electronically controlled. More of a powered glider, really. Solar 
powered. A dream to fly."

"So these aren't jet engines under the wings?"

"No. Electric fans. They give propulsion when needed and generate electricity on 
the overrun."

"Wow. It looks as if it would blow away in a brisk breeze. I can see it shifting 
as I stand here."

"Watch the tail."

"Oh, I see. It's trimming itself all the time to face the wind."

"That's right. It needs lots of room so it can turn itself around. Up to a sixty 
knot wind, it automatically adjusts its orientation and control surfaces to stay 
lift neutral. The harder it blows, the harder it stays down. Above sixty knots, 
it's safer airborne. The makers recommend you get a line on it and let it fly 
like a kite. But I've never tried that because you'd need much more flat ground 
than I've usually got. High winds like that only happen a couple of times a year 
around here, and if Meteorology says there's a storm on the way, I just fly out 
and dodge it. The harder it blows, the higher I fly."

"It looks expensive."

"It was, but the running costs are negligible. You ready?"

<div class=pullquote>The heroes of the revolution down below 
like to take potshots at any aircraft they see</div>
Leon watched as Rae organised an operator with an ancient Land Rover to tow 
Nostromo to the start of the runway. The Land Rover drove a few hundred yards 
down the tarmac, paying out a long nylon rope. Leon climbed aboard into a seat 
behind the pilot, surrounded by crates of plastic containers, while Rae 
connected the end of the rope somewhere up front. She then climbed in, pressed a 
button to start the fans, and waved to the driver of the Land Rover. In seconds, 
they were bowling along steadily, the aircraft already alive and eager to fly, 
towed by the Land Rover. Rae operated something up front, and they leapt into 
the air quite suddenly. She pulled a lever, and they were free, still climbing 
under the power of the fans. Rae was working hard, pulling and locking various 
levers.

"Getting up the undercarriage," she explained over her shoulder, "Saves 
electricity if I do it by hand."

"Do you always need a tug to get airborne?" asked Leon.

"No. Same answer. The fan'll get us up, but a tow saves juice. Give me a minute 
or two. I'll just find us a nice thermal for altitude." 

From several thousand feet, Leon could see the startling effects of the Libyan 
desert irrigation project. Sea water distilled to fresh. Huge rectangles of 
arable land were appearing in the desert.

The only sounds in the aircraft were the wind and the intermittent hum of the 
fan. The ride was amazingly smooth. Rae talked endlessly about the wonders of 
Nostromo. Theoretically, she could stay airborne indefinitely, like an 
albatross, drawing on the energy of the wind and sun, though, of course, there 
were food, drink and other matters to consider. 

Progress was irregular. Sometimes they paused and circled in an updraught to 
gain height; sometimes they flew steadily with the electric fans humming; often, 
they cruised in straight and slightly downward flight like a sailplane. Some six 
hours after take-off, they landed at what appeared to be a former oil company 
airstrip, attended by an Italian-speaking caretaker who seemed to have been 
expecting them.

They ate pasta prepared by the caretaker, drank water, and bedded down for the 
night in a corrugated iron hut. They took off in the early dawn next day, an 
almost vertical ascent into a stiff breeze. A few hours into the flight, Leon 
started to see the signs of stunted bushes and trees, which thickened as the day 
progressed. The vast Lake Chad (less vast than it was in yesteryear) stretched 
to the southern horizon.

Eventually, Rae pointed out a set of military huts below. "There's your 
hospital. I'm turning west for the airstrip."

The setting sun blazed into the cockpit, and Leon heard bursts of crackling over 
the wind rush. 

"What's that?" he asked.

The airstrip was visible now. Tiny figures in a jeep below were gesticulating. 
They were only 30 metres above the raw desert. Rae was busy deploying the 
undercarriage as she spoke: "Gunfire. The heroes of the revolution down below 
like to take potshots at any aircraft they see in case it's a government attack. 
They use SAM missiles from time to time, but I don't generate enough heat or 
radar signal for them to get a target lock. They seldom hit anything with small 
arms fire." 

A loud ping and rattle somewhere up front gave the lie to this statement, but 
nothing more happened before they were dropping onto the start of a rough runway 
of crushed red gravel. There was another aircraft drawn up to the side, a couple 
of army trucks decorated with red crosses on white circles and a few men in 
khaki.

"Hello, what's this?" said Rae, "I don't usually have any company here."

"Looks military medical," said Leon.

"It certainly does. If you don't want to stay, I'll take off right away."

While it looked a little iffy, Leon wasn't keen to abandon his mission at this 
stage. "They don't look particularly hostile. I'll see if they'll give me a lift 
to the hospital."

Rae taxied to an open space, and they climbed stiffly to the ground. 
Surprisingly, most of the soldiers paid no attention to them as they approached. 
One, however, came towards them with a smile. 

"Leon, I think they're Chinese," said Rae. "That's one of the medics I flew in 
last month, but he wasn't in uniform then."

The medic concerned spoke good English, greeted them politely and was apparently 
delighted to ferry Leon to the hospital. But he pointed out that Dr Warriston 
was not there. 

"Do you know where she is?" asked Leon.

"Yes, I do."

"And..."

"She is here, of course. I will take you to her."

Jenny, perspiring in the loading bay of the aircraft, was surprised, but not 
pleased, to see Leon. She broke off from whatever she was doing, and jumped 
down.

"What in God's name are you doing here, Leon?" were her exact words, uttered in 
a voice that discouraged reply.

"Hi, Jenny. This is Rae, who brought me here."

"Hello, Rae, we've never met, but I'm aware of your shuttle service. I suppose, 
Leon, that these clowns at Driffield Brown are still trying to recruit me, and 
that you are their latest desperate attempt. Professor Ochre, yes?"

"Yes."

"He's had my answer by phone, letter and e-mail."

"I told them they were wasting their time, but I thought 'Why not come and see 
you, anyway?'"

"It's not a good moment."

"I imagine not. What's going on?"

"Well, maybe it <I>is</I> a good moment. I'm closing down here and setting up a 
new facility in China." She paused, and eyed Leon carefully. "Got your 
passport?"

"Of course."

"Well, give us a hand here, and you can come along. I've been told I can bring 
anyone I like. I'm sure Professor Ochre would approve of your persistence. You 
can decide later whether to ditch Driffield Brown and join the good guys."

Leon stared.

"C'mon. It's either this or back to the Professor. I think the People's Republic 
is much less risky."

<p class=drop>Half an hour later, they waved to Rae, who was repairing a bullet hole in 
Nostromo with a sort of puncture repair kit, and boarded the plane chartered by 
the Chinese, an elderly, not to say ancient, Canadian de Haviland Dash 7, 
painted in camouflage colours, with Red Cross symbols and hard-to-read 
identification insignia. On board, in addition to the French pilot, Jenny and 
Leon, were the two Chinese medics and four Africans in medical stretchers, who 
nevertheless looked pretty healthy to Leon. Every inch of cargo space was 
occupied by cardboard crates.

It was pitch dark outside as they took off along a faint flare path of 
flickering LEDs. In the spartan cabin, Leon looked at Jenny and raised an 
eyebrow. He felt a thrilling <I>frisson</I> at being with her again.

"What?" she asked.

"It's nice to see you, too." He said it sarcastically, but he smiled to take the 
sting out.

Jenny's mouth firmed into a straight line. Then she said, "It's a bit of a 
surprise."

"But a pleasant one?"

I'll get back to you on that. I'm very busy right now, as you may have noticed." 

"Can you bear to fill me in?"

"We fly to Sudan, transfer to a Chinese military transport, and continue to 
Tientsin in Northern China. There's a new facility out in the sticks just 
waiting for us to arrive, and I won't be starved for resources."

"What happened to 'cheap medicines for third world countries'?"

"You know what happened. I wasn't the only pirate operation in the world. Every 
philanthropist with a degree in pharma started a cottage industry, and now all 
the big companies are doing what we asked them to do years ago, and selling 
their mature products at a price a small setup couldn't match."

Leon began to feel uncomfortable at this hard-faced Jenny, "So you're out of business."

"In that respect, yes. But what I've got now is something very much better."

"And that is?"

"A breakthrough in HIV treatment."

"But the entire board of Driffield Brown would crawl over broken glass for 
that."

"Not for my cure."

"Why not?"

"You're getting into too much detail. I don't want to discuss it."

"You've got a new treatment for HIV, and you don't want to discuss it?"

"Not with you. Not with anyone."

"Except your Chinese friends."

"Right."

"So you can corner the market? Like one of the pharma companies you always 
hated?"

"No. Look. I'm going to make it available. I'm going to China so that the big 
drugs companies can't suppress it with legal injunctions, negative propaganda 
and commercial blackmail."

"So what is it?"

"Are you sure you want to know? Knowing will commit you. I may have to kill 
you."

"Oh, Jenny, you can trust me."

"Can I?"

"Absolutely. Let's have it." Leon was sure of this. Part of it was to get closer 
to Jenny, he realised that, but being associated with an important discovery was 
a huge potential bonus.

"OK," said Jenny, "I'll go back to the beginning. I started out by building a 
production line for nuceloside analogues - HIV inhibitors - like AZT et cetera. 
I knew how to do that."

"Sure. That was the way to go."

"And a protease inhibitor for combination HIV therapy, also freely adapted from 
a commercial product."

"Obviously," said Leon, "You'd need that too."

"You realise why I had to do this in a third world country."

"Of course. If you set up a production line in South London, you'd be locked up 
for patent infringement in a fortnight. I'm just sorry I didn't feel rebellious 
enough to come with you."

"But here's the thing, Leon. I needed a whole raft of HIV sufferers to test on. 
I mean, the chemicals were OK. They analysed indistinguishable from the pukka 
product. I just wanted to build a little confidence. This was Africa. There 
would be no shortage of HIV positives, I thought. But there <b><i>was</i></b> a 
shortage. In the precise area of Chad where I'd set up shop, where HIV and AIDS 
were a big problem a few years ago, I could only find a handful of subjects - 
less than fifty. It turned out, and this is where it starts to sound weird, a 
local village doctor had a cure."

Leon smirked. How often had there been rumours like this? "Oh, c'mon, Jenny."

"I know. But listen. Among my test subjects, there was a pair of sisters that 
I'd been treating. I had good records on them over several months. Both were HIV 
positive. In the middle of my drug trial, their relatives saved up enough money 
to send them to the doctor. We're not talking big bucks here. A breeding pair of 
goats in Chad will cost a peasant a year's income. The sisters were cured. Both 
of them. The HIV had gone. No trace. Well, I say 'no trace'..."

"Aaah."

"The 'cure', you see, is actually another disease. It's been known for some time 
that one virus can interact with another and produce a different virus by a 
process of reallocation of viral RNAs. It appears that two different HIV strains 
have combined to create a new virus which doesn't cause immunity problems in 
humans, and which out-competes the strains of HIV that do cause trouble. It's 
also been known for some time that occasional patients turn up, who appear to be 
immune to HIV. You know about the Kenyan prostitutes?"

"Didn't they turn out not to be immune after all?"

"Well, those that ceased to have regular contact with HIV eventually lost the 
immunity, that's true. But it appeared that continuous exposure maintained the 
resistance. My theory is that this new disease resembles HIV sufficiently 
closely to give the body immunity."

"So where did this witch doctor get the treatment from?"

"He's not a witch doctor. He's more of a herbalist and vet. Don't ask me how he 
stumbled on it, but it appears that one of his tricks was to draw blood from one 
person and inject it into another. I think he had a sort of vague idea of 
vaccination. He'd been doing it for years.  You may know that Chinese alchemists 
administered smallpox inoculation a thousand years ago, so it was a known 
technique before it was discovered in the West."

"Yes, I heard that."

"Well, at some point, he must have mixed up strains of HIV and produced this new 
one in a patient, then transmitted it along not knowing what he was doing. His 
patients also spread it by sexual contact, and in a remarkably short time, he 
had a healthy population of HIV-resistant patients and their friends and 
relatives. It's a small world in an African village. I did a lot of checking, 
and a little experimentation, but it worked. It really works. All that's 
required is to spread the disease. I'm having the impudence to call it Warriston's 
Disease."

"So why don't you tell everybody?"

"It has a side-effect."

"Which is?"

"Leon, there's a plague in this world. It's a plague that's destroying quality 
of life for millions, killing the planet, threatening even the continuation of 
the human race."

"AIDS is hardly <b><I>that</I></b> bad."

"I'm not talking about AIDS, Leon. I'm talking about over-population."

"So you're going to withhold your cure and let everyone die of AIDS?"

"No. I'm going to let the side-effect run amok."

"What's the side effect?"

"Sterility."

Leon was silent for a moment or two. "But that means that people have to choose 
immunity or children."

"Not if they don't know."

"But it'll leak out."

"Eventually. It'll be noticed. Meanwhile, the Chinese and Indians are very 
interested because both have exploding populations and a largely hidden HIV 
problem. For many in the West, immunity from AIDS and a lifelong contraceptive 
would be a bonus, by the way."

"And meanwhile?"

"Meanwhile, I'm starting with four donors - you saw them being loaded - and a 
plan to create thousands more in a project in China. A test tube of blood from a 
donor will treat twenty or thirty patients, but we still have to build a 
production facility like an inverted pyramid. A donor can give a pint of blood 
every couple of weeks, but will take thousands of donors to manufacture doses in 
sufficient quantity to be effective. It will be a while before it becomes widely 
available. Certainly, it could be years before the problem became well known. 
And even then anyone with HIV would probably be glad to make the sacrifice of 
sterility in return for a permanent cure, don't you think?"

Leon was horrified. "I don't believe you are doing this. A bit of philanthropic 
patent busting is one thing, but knowingly spreading a sterility virus in secret 
is something else altogether!"

"I thought it might be a mistake to tell you. You were always a sanctimonious 
little prick, Leon."

"You've changed."

"No, I haven't. I've still got the good of the planet at heart." Jenny was silent
for a few moments. "Look, I need to know if you're with me."

"You can't expect me to go along with this!"

"I'm sorry to hear that, Leon. It's pretty lonely out here.
Anyway, I have 
to keep the lid on it for the time being. So... I'm afraid you are going to be 
another donor for a while. I can't let you go now, Leon. I'm sorry. Perhaps we can work 
together when you get used to the idea."

Leon tried to stand up, but the Chinese medics grabbed him and strapped him down 
to a spare stretcher. 

"You'll never get away with it!" he yelled.

"Oh, God. That line comes from a James Bond movie, Leon. I already 
<b><i>have</i></b> got away with it. My teams of donors are already spreading 
across Africa, keen to mingle their body fluids with willing patients, spreading 
good health and birth control throughout the continent. Your little friend Rae 
has ferried quite a few gratefully diseased well-off people to Tripoli, most of 
whom will energetically introduce the virus into Europe and America."

Leon resorted to insults and entreaties.  The plane droned on and Jenny caught a 
little sleep. Her lack of reponse made Leon even more desperate. 

Shortly thereafter, one of the Chinese medics anaesthetized Leon to keep him 
quiet.

[*ITEM] The Skylark of Space

[*AUTHOR] E.E. (Doc) Smith
												   
[*BLURB] Ahhh! Classic Pulp SF from the master of the corny sf tale.
Note the "dusky" assistant, the "Dick, old top" form of address, the
illustration of space adventure with rivets and galvanometers in
evidence. It's not a bad tale, really, unless you feel the writing is
so bad you can't read it. Nevertheless, Skylark was hugely popular in its day and
is now available in Gutenberg. Just to whet your appetite, here is the 
beginning of the story, and you can see that he gets right into the action. 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Petrified with astonishment, Richard Seaton stared after the copper
steam-bath upon which he had been electrolyzing his solution of "X," the
unknown metal. For as soon as he had removed the beaker the heavy bath
had jumped endwise from under his hand as though it were alive. It had
flown with terrific speed over the table, smashing apparatus and bottles
of chemicals on its way, and was even now disappearing through the open
window. He seized his prism binoculars and focused them upon the flying
vessel, a speck in the distance. Through the glass he saw that it did
not fall to the ground, but continued on in a straight line, only its
rapidly diminishing size showing the enormous velocity with which it was
moving. It grew smaller and smaller, and in a few moments disappeared
utterly.

The chemist turned as though in a trance. How was this? The copper bath
he had used for months was gone--gone like a shot, with nothing to make
it go. Nothing, that is, except an electric cell and a few drops of the
unknown solution. He looked at the empty space where it had stood, at
the broken glass covering his laboratory table, and again stared out of
the window.

He was aroused from his stunned inaction by the entrance of his colored
laboratory helper, and silently motioned him to clean up the wreckage.

"What's happened, Doctah?" asked the dusky assistant.

"Search me, Dan. I wish I knew, myself," responded Seaton, absently,
lost in wonder at the incredible phenomenon of which he had just been a
witness.

Ferdinand Scott, a chemist employed in the next room, entered breezily.

"Hello, Dicky, thought I heard a racket in here," the newcomer remarked.
Then he saw the helper busily mopping up the reeking mass of chemicals.

"Great balls of fire!" he exclaimed. "What've you been celebrating? Had
an explosion? How, what, and why?"

"I can tell you the 'what,' and part of the 'how'," Seaton replied
thoughtfully, "but as to the 'why,' I am completely in the dark. Here's
all I know about it," and in a few words he related the foregoing
incident. Scott's face showed in turn interest, amazement, and pitying
alarm. He took Seaton by the arm.

"Dick, old top, I never knew you to drink or dope, but this stuff sure
came out of either a bottle or a needle. Did you see a pink serpent
carrying it away? Take my advice, old son, if you want to stay in Uncle
Sam's service, and lay off the stuff, whatever it is. It's bad enough to
come down here so far gone that you wreck most of your apparatus and
lose the rest of it, but to pull a yarn like that is going too far. The
Chief will have to ask for your resignation, sure. Why don't you take a
couple of days of your leave and straighten up?"

Seaton paid no attention to him, and Scott returned to his own
laboratory, shaking his head sadly.

Seaton, with his mind in a whirl, walked slowly to his desk, picked up
his blackened and battered briar pipe, and sat down to study out what he
had done, or what could possibly have happened, to result in such an
unbelievable infraction of all the laws of mechanics and gravitation. He
knew that he was sober and sane, that the thing had actually happened.
But why? And how? All his scientific training told him that it was
impossible. It was unthinkable that an inert mass of metal should fly
off into space without any applied force. Since it had actually
happened, there must have been applied an enormous and hitherto unknown
force. What was that force? The reason for this unbelievable
manifestation of energy was certainly somewhere in the solution, the
electrolytic cell, or the steam-bath. Concentrating all the power of his
highly-trained analytical mind upon the problem--deaf and blind to
everything else, as was his wont when deeply interested--he sat
motionless, with his forgotten pipe clenched between his teeth. Hour
after hour he sat there, while most of his fellow-chemists finished the
day's work and left the building and the room slowly darkened with the
coming of night.

Finally he jumped up. Crashing his hand down upon the desk, he
exclaimed:

"I have liberated the intra-atomic energy of copper! Copper, 'X,' and
electric current!

[*ITEM] A Rambling Editorial

[*BLURB] All about the New Mythaxis Blog

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop> First of all, my apologies. This issue has taken an 
age to appear on your screens, but it's here at last.

One of the delays was caused by your editor working on other projects
when he should have been paying attention to Mythaxis. Then, some idiots
with sub-zero IQs (or, perhaps, just one idiot with multiple names)
trashed our forum  with thousands of adverts for
gaming sites, and I eventually had to scrap the forum, which was not, in any
event, a great hive of activity. 

Realising, as delay
piled on delay and issue 6 - this issue - was never finished, that the principle 
of individual issues for a magazine
was not a constraint on the internet, I started	to build a blog, which incorporated
a master index to Mythaxis, as well as allowing me to release individual stories
as soon as they are available,
and to make new story and new issue announcements as blog entries.

This is the address of the <A href=
"http://mythaxis.wordpress.com/mythaxis-magazine/"> 
Mythaxis Blog and Master Index.</A><BR>

Every time I have enough pre-releases to make a new issue, I will release them as an
issue in the traditional format, and do a blog entry. To be alerted to developments,
subscribe to the RSS feed on the blog.

And here's another cartoon from Liam Baldwin.
