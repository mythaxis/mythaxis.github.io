[*BLURB] Dating in the risk-averse age 

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>I was
sitting at my usual table in Gino's, knocking back a few after a hard
day at the office, when I saw her standing at the bar. A face that could
launch a thousand space shuttles, legs till forever, a real looker any
way you wanted to cut it. Our eyes met across the room, and right off the
bat I could tell she was interested; her eyes were brown but the look
she gave me was green traffic light all the way. I finished my drink and
sauntered over to the bar.

<div class=pullquote>"What say we get to know each
other a little better while we wait?"</div>I nodded in the general direction of the barman. "Gimme another, Gino."
Playing it cool, making like I hadn't even seen her till I saw her.
While I waited for my drink I turned and shot her a look of my own.
Mouth set straight, one eyebrow raised; tough but tender, a little world
weary. It was a good look, one I'd practised enough to get it down pat.
The hint of a smile creased one corner of her full, pouting lips; it was
encouragement enough to hit her with a line.

"Hey, baby, who's your lawyer?"

Sure, it was corny, but I could tell she dug it all the same.
Those big, brown eyes walked up and down one last time, then she
replied: 

"Arthur Bingham. Bingham, Klein & Bingham."
 
I flipped open my cell, punched speed-dial and waited. Gino set my drink
down on the bar and I tipped him another nod before taking a slug. At
the other end of the line a woman's voice chirped:

"Thompson & Sons, Attorneys at Law. How may I direct your call?"

"Let me speak to Thompson, and hold on the Sons." Brown Eyes seemed to
get a kick out of that. <i>The London Philharmonic Plays Punk</i> butchered
something by <i>The Clash</i> for a few seconds before another voice cut in:

"Bob Thompson."

"Bob. Jack Brenner. I need you to file a motion of intent with Bingham,
Klein & Bingham. Client name of ..."

"Tabitha Brooks"

"You catch that? Yeah, Brooks. Standard searches, full disclosure, usual
terms &amp; conditions apply. Any contractual agreements to be witnessed by
Gino Fiore of Gino's Bar, Grill & Notary Services. Forward all the
paperwork to my cell and give me a call once you're done, okay?"

I left Bob to get busy and put in another call.

"Peter Briscoe Accountants."

"Pete. Jack Brenner. Listen, buddy, could you make my tax returns, bank
statements, insurance coverage and a breakdown of spending habits for
the last five years available to one Tabitha Brooks, through Bingham,
Klein & Bingham, and put in a request for all reciprocal data via the
same? Sooner the better, <i>compadre</i>."

"Jack, you sly dog! Consider it done."

I rang off and turned back to Tabitha. "What say we get to know each
other a little better while we wait?" I suggested. Fifteen minutes later
we were making pretty good progress. 

Her: 2% chance of cardio-vascular
disease, clean for STD's and no insanity or hereditary illness in the
family barring an aunt on the mother's side who had a nervous breakdown
a few years back. Certainly nothing deal-breaking. 

Me: 21 million per ml
spermatozoa count, with high percentage scores for normal shape and
rapid forward mobility, 8% body fat, no history of congenital hair loss.

We'd just about finished cross-checking medical records through an
independent healthcare service when Tabitha's phone chimed. No doubt her
lawyer ringing in with the verdict. I excused myself and headed for the
john, silently cursing the fact that Bob hadn't got back to me first. I
gave it a couple of minutes before I re-entered the bar, just as Tabitha
was winding up her conversation. It was difficult to read her face, and
I felt my stomach knot as she handed me the cell:

"Hello?"

"Mr Brenner? Arthur Bingham. I have been instructed by my client to
inform you that you meet with the specified legal, financial and medical
criteria as stipulated in the standard provisions for contracts of this
kind. I am duty bound to mention that there were some questions raised
by your felony / misdemeanour conviction for juvenile theft, but my
client has waived any objection on the grounds that she finds it 'cute',
although obviously not in any legally binding sense. Accordingly, I am
authorised to release her telephone number to your lawyer after the signing
of said contractual agreement in the presence of a licensed notary
public. Good day, sir."


I was walking on air. 
Sensing we were ready to seal the deal, Gino
hustled over to witness the exchange of signatures. I told him to add
his notarisation fee to my tab; I figured even in this day and age women
still went for that chivalrous touch, and Tabitha didn't say anything to
disabuse me of the notion. As she got set to leave the bar, Tabitha
leaned in and gave me a kiss on the cheek; not strictly legal at this
stage of the proceedings, but I wasn't about to call the cops. When she
reached the door she turned and threw another killer look in my
direction:

"It was nice meeting you Jack. I hope I'll be hearing from you soon."

"Oh, you'll be hearing from me plenty," I replied.

I was still staring at the empty doorway when my cell phone began to rumble
its way across the bar. A glance at the caller ID told me it was Bob.

"Better late than never, Bobby boy. What's the good word?"

"Jack, you're sounding chipper. I guess her people beat me to the punch.
I'm forwarding you my findings as we speak, but here are the edited
highlights. Tabitha Brooks, upscale address in Pasadena, works in the ad
game, low six figures. No arrest record, nothing untoward on the medical
checks, six registered previous relationships.  Shortest was three weeks,
back when she was in college; longest was two years which
ended... eighteen months ago. It all looks pretty rosy from where I'm
sitting. Arty Bingham released her number to me five minutes ago, it's
already been downloaded to your cell. So, you gonna give her a call or
what?"

I sighed, and waved Gino over with another shot.

"Jesus, I don't know, Bob. Pasadena, you're talking forty-five minutes on
the freeway. I mean, seriously, who needs that kind of hassle?"

[*ITEM] Red Fever 

[*AUTHOR] Peter Morrison 

[*BLURB] Almost poetry, this study of experimental subjects under pressure. 

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>Morning comes, and I have never slept in my life. A frustrated
non-drama that sends me into the world like a kicking and screaming
rebirth. Endless, restless nights haunting me. End of the world winds
whipping against the bullet-proof glass of the modular apartments.
Trapped by the environment again, like lab rats caged. She sleeps
soundlessly in the large empty bed, while I toss and turn like a dying
man on the too compact sofa. I roll over with surrender and dismay,
rest feet on floor, elbows on knees, head in hands. Eyes closed, I
breathe raggedly, rubbing hands against scalding stubble. Opening eyes
with gravity's reluctance, 
I take in her too slim, too young form,
spread in jigsaw contortions, blond fluff halo. Thin white t-shirt,
nearly transparent, rucked across bare stomach. She wears a thong,
disappearing into elusive and tantalising cracks. I shake my head, try
to break thoughts back into shards, derail that train from perilous
tracks, and fail. Life between my thighs, grows, rigid, threatening
and dominant. My stomach leaps with fear, that she will wake, and find
me sitting there, desolate and aroused. The last time we spoke we
fought, she said she hated me. Like I need to encourage her disdain by
letting her find me like this. Despite that I touch myself; unbendable
thing, that unrelenting beast. I choke on my cry, slumping, hands
thrown aside, and it stands there. I look at her lying there, and she
moans and moves, but doesn't wake, and the beast goes deeper in me,
and the thing called lust roars.

<div class=pullquote>Men! Useless bastards, the lot of them.</div>
Unsteady and precarious with denial I stumble to the door, the double
layers that provide an air lock. Our suits hang there. I look out
upon my internal struggle, a Martian surface scoured by the latest
storm front, reflecting and causing the turmoil inside. These pioneer
habitations, two half moons, a dense reliant community, become a
series of isolation cells. I breathe the air of souring captivity. Red
dust, like hell's very own fabric, lifted from Martian earth and
turned to devil spirals. Between us the notion of a road, an accepted
and shared concept between the members of the colony, it's just another
fucking red strip of seared surface. The other crescent of apartments
across the way, identical to this one. Three flats along, in opposite
position from here another man stands, looking out as though into
hell. We press our hands against this specially engineered glass,
taunting each other, like mirror images that we will use to torture
ourselves. I bet his partner still loves him; I bet he is still happy
with his role in this great adventure. Great adventure, a conceptual
kick to the head, and I slide to the floor, back against the hatch,
bare hands and feet against the coarse, cheap pod floor covering.

Cabin fever induces madness, I recognise this fact, we recognise this
fact; Martian fever is worse, the inherent idea of the alien. We were
told about this fact in orientation, prepared in sequences of
psychological tests and appraisals. Regardless, we step from familiar
planetary territories into brave new worlds, with foolish confidence
and self-assurance. Not until you are here, laid bare for the demonic
influence, for the endless tests and appraisals, can you understand.
Not until you find yourself constrained to quarters due to surface
planetary environmental conditions can you understand. Confined again,
till you feel you have spent more time trapped here than you ever did
doing your job. Scientists, explorers, adventurers, and pioneers from
the home planet searching for ways out of the horror of what we left
behind. Only to find a new horror in front, we were not designed for
this life-style, though the suggestion is that we will adapt. Rats in
a cage, we are experimental subjects abused and prodded, tick boxes on
checklists. When the storm dissipates, we will be put on the wheel
once more, running to go nowhere through all the trick questions and
character assassinations. Encouraged to inform on each other, all
those questions, like being trapped with this bitch, waiting to find
she betrayed me, wanting to strangle her, wanting to... I shake my
head free of those thoughts again. Look at her sweet face - god -
innocent and unknowing. Slight silent sighs escape me, slight silent
voice, tainted by loneliness, bitch.

How the fuck can she sleep through this? There is a constant sound
here, the sound of filters and processors; those back stage mechanics
that keep us alive. Air filters and re-processors, recycle units
capturing and regurgitating ancillary matter, food dispensers. All
connected to the hub unit of each block, run by endless programs and
systems. Blind, unspeaking sentience that controls everything we do in
this place? You learn to filter those sounds out, but when the storm
hits... we are on a new level, the kind of howling nightmare that
triggers fever dreams and lyrical waxing. That batters you from sleep,
bloody eyed and at the end of your tether. Full of hurt and bloody
hate. I release my fists, stretch out the suddenly gathered tension
from my knuckles. It lasts only a moment, before I clench again,
violent desire demanding animal action - go on, lash out, express the
emotion. No.

Enough. I drag myself to the shower cubicle. Start the water running
hard. And I hurt myself. And hurt myself. Head against the smooth bare
wall. Till I think my knees will give in, till I grunt, till I hurt no
more. Hands against the wall, water washes everything away. If I focus
on that sound, let it fill me, for a moment I can forget. For a
moment. Sleeplessness hits me, tidal waves of exhaustion battering my
merely human body. I drag myself back to the sofa. Too small for me,
but I curl up as best I can, hug myself, close my eyes, and pray for
sleep. Please, God, let me sleep through this hellish night, this
relentless storm.
 
<p class=drop>Dark outside, the storm still rages, dust particles whipping around.
Lashing our building with their fine composition. Fall asleep
exhausted - sleep all day - wake up exhausted. For three days now I
have done nothing. Why do I ache so much? This confinement becomes
frustrating and dizzying. Living on edge, little tensions become
exaggerated. The waiting is difficult. Like that night before we took
off, drawn out endlessly till it grows hollow. I tug my t-shirt down,
it's rolled up while I slept. I sit there, dazed, legs half crossed,
and shoulder slumped. Tired. I'm in our bed. Alone again. Alone since
we fought, things got out of hand so quickly. Look at him. Naked on
the sofa. My man. My bear. Look at the size of him - his chest, those
arms. I want to leap on him. Wrap myself around him. I want to hold
him to me. Look at him. I hug myself.

So quick with his shouting. Pig headed bastard. Doesn't he know I just
want him to hold me? Doesn't he know how hard it is to be trapped in
here waiting? I get so mad at everything; I end up telling him I hate
him. It makes me want to hit him. Kill him in his sleep. But I don't
even have a knife. Food comes from the hatch, ready to eat with a
spoon. You would almost think that was a deliberate move? Are those
management bastards playing with us? Are cameras recording everything
even now? Did they know it would be this bad? They told us it would be
this bad. Did we listen to them? Did we understand when they said it
would be difficult, that it would be like this? I want to brush my
hand through his hair, and to beat him to death with a spoon. I laugh,
hold myself against a cold wave, against foolishness.

I throw myself out of bed; a clambering, graceless child. With my
skinny limbs, no wonder he doesn't find me attractive, there is
nothing of me. I pad across the floor, quietly. Standing over him, too
big for this makeshift bed, but he refused to share with me, or I with
him, one of the two. Reaching out, hesitating, finger tips so close,
close enough to touch. Look at his face, fierce and scowling. Look at
him, he plans to kill me in my sleep. Look at him, naked and
vulnerable now. Cupping himself, what is that about? Is it comforting?
Is it sexual? I don't know. I crouch beside him, mimicking him. Puff
my cheeks out - ook. Look at you, barely evolved past the gorilla.
How I want you. Sink to my knees, emptied out by thoughts of sex.
Emptied out by hunger, by that barren empty void inside. If it had
teeth it would eat you, man! I would eat you alive! Close my eyes and
breathe. Ache. A second pulsing organ in my body, a sense of life.
Breathe deeper, breathe to fight the feeling.

I stand, straighten and stretch. Can I touch the ceiling of the pod? I
brush it lightly, such a tiny place for two people to live in. No
wonder we are bouncing off each other. I pad to the toilet, stalking
silently. Don't want to wake him, make him mad. A hole in the floor,
to squat over, underwear poised round my knees. Welcome to the future,
welcome to the hole in the ground, the luxury of being the first and
the finest. Pissing into a tank beneath the floor contents flushing
into the recycling system. Yum. Tug the tiny pair of knickers back on,
for all the difference they make. He still won't touch me.

In a gesture of design cunning, the food/drink dispenser is beside the
shower/toilet facility. Don't think of the cyclical nature of the
system, I come out and push the button for coffee. Men! Shitting where
they eat! Wasn't that rule one in the survival guide? When did
whatever optimum tick box that is responsible for that choice outweigh
the basic rules of survival. I taste the coffee - it still tastes
bitter, still tastes wrong. I take a mouthful of denial. And just
drink the stuff. Men! Useless bastards, the lot of them.

I walk back to the sofa. Standing over him, I feel a hundred feet
tall, towering over him. I consider pouring the coffee over him. But
it's not even hot enough to cause a memorable burn. And it might taste
like shit, but it is the only option we have. I shrug, and take
another mouthful. Close my eyes and think mechanical thoughts about
mechanical actions, and how I want to do those mechanical things.
Bastard. So I shrug and stroll over to the bed. I grab the blanket;
one of those absurd new fabrics designed especially for life on Mars,
and drag it behind me. Drag it to the air lock, lots of glass,
specially engineered, rocket ship seals round it to keep it all in
place and intact, designed to resist the storm outside at its worst. I
hunker down, place the coffee in front of me, and wrap the blanket
round myself. Not that it's cold, these pods are maintained at a
comfortable level by the hub. It's a comfort thing, to feel as though
I am held, encompassed. I cup the coffee in my hands, and settle down
to watch the storm. Hypnotised and fascinated by the patterns of the
dust. The chaotic flow of turbulent streams. Such vivid, violent reds,
even at night; the place seems alive, transformed and wondrous. One
moment everything is gone, consumed by dust. The next there are
patches of clarity, the identical block across the road visible. There
are lights on in some windows others are dark. Two blocks, 25 flats in
each, each built to hold a couple. We are the first 100 people on
Mars, and it pulses with a startling violence.

[*ITEM] Eat, Monster Blue Bottle 

[*AUTHOR] Belinda&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Taylor  

[*BLURB] When you're driving and tired, there's nothing like a hitchhiker to wake you up.

[*DESCRIPTION] 

<p class=drop>Getting lost in 90 degree weather is no way to end a life. 
I would constantly entertain myself with outrageous fantasies when stuck
in a situation like this. On some gravel road in the middle of nowhere. Hoping that a town would appear. 
The heat was gripping me inside the truck, and making the air beyond my windshield dance and move.
The rolled-down windows did nothing to help me.
I saw my dried-out body driving around in circles until a stray sheriff's car had to run me down to shake 
my mummified foot from the gas.

<div class=lpullquote>"It's funny," I said, "Earlier, I thought I saw a dog with you."</div>My attention was  refocused on the figure moving in the distance. I lost sight of it as 
the road dropped into a small dip. The constant vibration of my truck was beginning to drive me nuts.
I began to wonder how something as simple as a gravel road could be relaxing when I was a boy, but so annoying 
for an adult. I could only figure it was because 
I was used to the smooth, well-paved roads of the city I had lived in for the last ten years.

The figure came into view again as I topped the hill and the road levelled out. I cringed a bit as I 
thought I saw a large dog walking beside him. I wiped the sweat from my eyes and saw just the boy, 
and fumbled for my bottle of water.
 
"I need to get out of this heat," I said, as I slowed the truck down. Then, "Hey, kid, is there a town up this way?"

He turned and examined me with gray eyes. It was almost insulting to be assessed by someone who didn't seem 
to have half the experience in life that I had gained. He appeared to decide something.

"Yes." His voice was very smooth.

"Thank God. Are you going that way?"

A smirk from the child.	Something in me wanted to be insulted by him, I had an impulse to hit the gas and 
leave him in the dust.

"Yes." He answered.

"I'll give you a ride if you can keep me in the right direction."

He just nodded and walked around the truck and got in. I looked down at his bare feet, and was 
amazed how clean they were, not even a touch of dust on his feet or legs. 
He held a cobalt blue glass bottle which he placed easily between his thighs as he looked forward. 
I forced the old truck into gear, and we moved forward.
He didn't ask any questions, which was unusual for kids that live in this part of the world. 
At his age, I was always curious about people passing through, only being able to reach beyond the small 
town through books and television.
It didn't take long for me to get a little irritated by the silence he was so much at ease with.

"It's funny," I said, "Earlier, I thought I saw a dog with you."

His eyes didn't move from the road ahead. "No, I don't have a dog."

I nodded. "I figure just a trick of the heat. I hate how hot it gets here in the summer."

I think he shrugged, but I couldn't be sure. It might have been imagination on my part.
I continued to talk about my childhood here and how boring I found it. And how I wanted to travel. My family 
had all been content to stay in the country and farm. It was a hell to me. I always had an itch to 
be someplace else where there was more to see and do. I didn't want to marry one of the girls 
I had known my entire life, though that was what was expected of me.

"You want to travel?" I was starting to feel awkward with his silence.

"I do,"	he said. His voice wasn't affected by the constant bounce of the road. I couldn't tell if he meant 
'Yes, I want to travel' or 'I <i>do</i> travel'. One more thing to add to a growing list of things that made 
this kid creepy.

His head turned to the passenger window, looking out into the field of green 
that reached forever and made this place seem even more suffocating.
 
"Ended up in this mess because of this truck," I muttered to myself, not caring if the kid was listening or not. 
"I bought this truck on my own. I didn't get anything from my father. My brother told me they wanted to sell it
because they were having some money problems. Only they couldn't, legally. My name is on 
the title.. Growing up here sucked ass. I left it behind when I got out." 

I actually felt as though the boy was paying attention, but he still said nothing.

"But there was no way I was going to let him sell the first thing I could call my own."	I remembered the 
amazed look on my brother's face when I showed up for the truck. I think he really
believed he would be doing me a favor by getting rid of it. "Let me tell ya, kid, I don't need any
more favors from him."

I looked over at the boy. He was holding the glass bottle up to the open window. It was hard to pull my 
eyes away from that deep, amazing blue. I got caught up in it, and saw something swirling inside.

I jolted my eyes away as the truck lurched. I looked down at a pale hand on the steering wheel, holding 
it straight. And back at his gray eyes watching me.

"Don't gaze at it too long, you need to drive," he said.

My hands were firm on the wheel again. I felt like an idiot, ranting about my brother, then getting 
hypnotized by that damn bottle the kid had.

"He didn't do nice things."	The kid didn't ask. He made a statement.

I shook my head. "No, I wasn't like him, growing up. He was quarterback on the football team. Played 
baseball, Prom King, the works. Those were his glory years. I was a little dork. And for the most part 
he made me feel like I was an embarrassment to him and my family." I took another swig from the warm water bottle.	
"When his friends picked on me, he didn't do anything 
about it. Never, not once, I hated him for that. I never got the nerve to ask him why, back then."

"But you did, this time." The kid was holding the bottle up to the window again.

"Yeah, when I came to get this old thing," I shook my head.	"He didn't have an answer, and seemed 
pissed I would even bring it up. But I really wanted to know why he would just watch them smack me 
around and laugh about it."

I could feel his eyes on me. I didn't want to look, I knew he had that bottle up. "People do things they regret."
Everything that fell out of his mouth was more than a little kid ought to know. He seemed out of place.

"Where are you from?" I asked.

"Not here,"	he answered.

"It's dangerous to hitchhike, especially someone your age."

I looked at him as he smiled at me. He held the bottle close to his chest, thumb over the round opening.
"Agatha is waiting for me, She'll be happy for me to get home sooner."

"Shouldn't she come and get you?"

He shook his head, as if I should know better. "She has things to tend to."

I began to wonder if I should take this kid to the police station when we made it to town.

His movement was almost too quick for me to notice, as he pointed the bottle's open end out of the window, 
a moment before something hit the side of the truck hard enough to make us tilt. 
We fishtailed on the gravel road even before I hit the brakes, forgetting I was driving a stick shift.  We stalled 
coming to a stop.
He was looking back out the rear window. I was breathing hard, clutching the wheel, afraid to look what we
hit.

Until I heard the whisper of a growl.

My eye went to the rear view mirror. I saw something roll out of sight to the left of the truck. 
I turned, craning out of the 
open driver's window as whatever it was continued to  roll and toss 
into the field, hitting the growing crop, kicking up dirt, and unearthing the green as it slid. 
It stopped, and I gasped as it separated into two creatures, which circled each other.
Neither seemed real, one with four legs, and tight muscle, spines on its back, and a large, gaping maw. 
It hissed and the spines moved like hair, then became liquid, and almost mist, before snapping back 
to their solid form. The other creature was made of leftover things, things people toss in a ditch. Grass, 
bones, old straw, burlap and rope, with congealing mud holding it together. 
Its mouth was apparent as it bared its teeth, but the rest of its face was obscured by stuff hanging down.
And they both gave the air of wanting to kill.

"What the hell.." I said, as they launched at each other again. Snarling, ripping and tearing at each 
other. The growls should have been loud; you should have been able to hear them for miles the way 
they where going at each other. But the sound barely carried to the truck.

"Do you need help?" the boy's smooth voice inquired.

I shook my head, not wanting to look away from the horror.

"It's polite to ask. I'm quite sure you can take care of it."

I realized he wasn't talking to me.

Finally, after tearing a haphazard trail through the field, the creature with the gaping maw and
spines grasped the other by what I had to assume was the throat, pushing down with its front legs 
as it stretched its head up to the sky. 

There was a sickening whisper of flesh being torn as it ripped its victim's head off and proceeded to swallow 
it whole.
Part of me wanted to be sick, the other half was fascinated. I watched it devour the loser as it struggled 
in death. In the end there were only a few stray pieces left. It didn't seem concerned about them as it turned 
and looked at us, its moss green eyes taking in my truck.

"We shouldn't stay here." I said.

My panic kicked in as it turned and started towards us. I reached for the ignition and found no keys. 
I looked at the boy, who was swinging them on his index finger. I reached for them, all sorts of nasty 
words on my tongue.	

"We can't leave him behind." He tilted his head, eyes fixed on the creature approaching us.
"He'll catch us anyhow, he's quite fast. I bred him that way."

I stopped, my eyes wide as saucers as the thing appeared in the open passenger window. 
The boy reached
his hand out and scratched it above the eye. A whispered purr of contentment floated to me.
The kid held up the bottle and the creature flowed into the opening. I watched it until nothing 
remained. I stared hard at the bottle for while, waiting to see if anything moved inside. 
I looked up at the smiling boy as he handed me my keys.

I started the truck. "You don't have a dog."

He shook his head. "You didn't ask if had a pet."

I nodded. "No, I didn't."

The heat didn't seem so bad after that. I was happy to see trees spring up in the distance, and houses 
dot the horizon.

[*AUTHOR] Chris&nbsp;Lites  

[*BLURB] This piece is very much a homage to William Gibson, but
it is an experience all of its own. Rich brown writing, this.

[*DESCRIPTION]  
<p class=drop>The sign pointing off the interstate
once read OASIS. Its steel bolts are scoured chrome by the sand, and 
the truck stop hasn't been, not really, not
for a very long time, an oasis. 

Now, Rand sits in the last hours of sun under the
chemical hemorrhage of sky, watching the truck stop logo play itself out
in an epileptic loop of hologram butterflies. Polychrome glint reflected
in the angle of a fading wing. An old gas station logo from childhood that he
remembers. The butterflies sputter over the concrete, and
the sand that has come in to 
reclaim the blacktop, winking in and out of
existence, oil-on-water wings, but the hydrogen pumps they advertise have long since ceased to
function. He watches from the motel across the street, here where
travelers would once have stayed, when these thick lanes saw traffic.
Sitting in the old deck chair out on concrete where the silt shifts
under the wind at the bottom of the pool, a gecko nearly the same blue
as the pool's faded paint regarding him with its limbic eyes.

<i>Rand's
fingers trace over the peeling laminate of the old photo album, cheap
even in its heyday, its cover a bubble-gum pink smudged now with age.
Inside, the happy family he has constructed awaits.
Someone else has
assembled the pictures, the post-cards, the fragments of self, 
none of
them really being related except by proximity of date, but Rand has made
them into a family. On the cover, where the label card used to be,
someone has written in old marker, 
in thick block capitals: THE AMERICAN
BOOK OF THE DEAD.</i>

Rand gathers his pack from his car, shifting the vehicle on its
carbon frame, thin and light as insect legs, just a husk now,
desiccated, powered out, useless, left here under the sun. He'll need
further transportation if he's going to continue to follow her, pursue
the steady distal pulse of her GPS across the desert. He pops open the
second to last of a self-cooling bottle of real Alaskan spring water and
thinks of his days on Farm 14, cool Pacific days along the coast so far
from the tip of Florida where he grew up. Far from the chaotic
changes of the lower forty-eight where things were going south rapidly.
He saw it firsthand, with his real family, before he became a
privatized orphan.

The sky has bled itself out and his gel-contacts
squirm in a way he has never gotten used to, adjusting to low light. He
forces a door to one of the motel rooms, allowing the stale air to
puff out toward him. 
He has stirred dust and particles of sand in the
old room. Nothing more than a bed, a vanity, a bathroom and moth-eaten
curtains shifting in the wind. Old style TV, one of those big types from
last century, the cathode ray tube long gone, he learned about those at
Farm 14, a piece of early technology. The gutted TV is now
some half-assed shrine left by passing migrants. Candles burnt down to
lozenges, a sun-bleached animal skull and what he takes to be an ill
conceived haiku, a sad offering to whatever animism the nomads have
taken to following these days. Never really having recovered from the
depression, they just broke off and franchised into a whole floating
sub-culture out here in the new dust bowl. Still, a place to bed down
for the night, find transport in the morning. He amps up his gels, the
unsettling squirm of proto-amphibian, bioengineered life. He opens his
photo album, so long now a prosthesis for absent things.

<i>He has no idea, nor does he want to imagine, who so carefully
assembled the pictures. They
are, he has come to realize, from a period of not more than two decades
of the great American century. And while the people in the album are not
strictly a family, he likes to imagine them as such. There is Father,
Mother, Son and Daughter, their faces, body types and clothing shifting;
they spend their days among the same summers, along the same roads
of an American world rich in Googie architecture, cantilevered coffee
shops, curvilinear UFO-inspired drive-in's, huge Lumber men, tiki gods
lording over shark finned future cars streamlined to roll their
occupants directly into the world of tomorrow. They are culled from the
unconscious of the "space-age". A time that maybe never really was, Rand
has come to realize, but one with which he has become so intimately familiar and
entranced, that, in the evening, before he beds down, he may be found
taking in a few of the white cardstock pages, the collected photos
secured with NuAge corner bonds, Kodak film almost exclusively -
pictures of happy people, people with bright futures limned in
possibility, rocket trajectories, beeping satellites, Fuller-domed moon
bases...</i>

<p class=drop>Hotter this morning, contacts giving him a HUD for temperature, wind
speed, his basic vitals, the present statistics of his world and being.
He takes his MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> out of his pack and unrolls it on the
scratched
table of the motel room. It adheres with a hiss, sealing
temporarily over a history of dust and grime. Rand wipes through the
muddle of tickers, broadcasts, news feeds and banner ads and directly to
his bookmarked tracking of her GPS. Making a steady beat for the Pacific
coast to find transport back to Brazil, to Rio, home. Always the
memories of the wet warrens and flooded barrios of that city inside her.
He remembers watching her when
she would come, looking at him, but truly
far away, staring at him from beneath layers of aquatic sunlight, all
the stunted promises of drowned kingdoms reflected in her eyes.

She is at least a day and a half ahead of him now, perhaps more if he
doesn't find transportation. But if he follows her too closely, she
may shut down the GPS altogether, may zone out, drop off the radar
and disappear back into the jungle. It is a game of sorts, their game,
or anyway he tells himself that this morning as he does from time to
time. Or, if he is going to be honest with himself, which he isn't, not
today, too hot for that - rivulets of sweat finding their way down his
buttocks, down the backs of his knees - it's really just classical
conditioning. Projecting onto the women in his life what he wants to be
there, that's what he does, that's what he learned... back then, in
Gainesville, with his sister.

<p class=drop>His sister was born with a brain that the doctors could just
never fully
correct. There were therapies employed, long string names that he had
forgotten and been too young to understand anyway. What it amounted to
was that, while she was present, most of her would always be locked
away. So, who she was became more a reflection of who you wanted her
to be and, though he would like to remember that, he tried to allow her
to be whatever it was that was inside herself, but he knew that was not
the case. His sister, the archetype, the blank slate, the art project,
more often a case to be managed, a situation to be solved, a story
problem. Keeping her occupied was the thing to do. He remembered her OCD
impulse for tying things around her fingers, anything that would bend,
anything you would give her - straw wrappers, thread, filament, fishing
line, errant hairs (hers-black) - starting with the index, then down to
the pinkie, left, then right, like scales. When you could get her doing
that, it was a kind of security. She wasn't lost, off exploring the
perimeter wire, the rusting razor falling into the rising surf, where
she would mark the progress of the escalating tide with colored ribbons,
more knotting, her own chart of the global upheaval. She wasn't at a pier
trying to catch a glimpse of refugees being broken upon the naval cordon
as they tried to get into the country, keeping her own inscrutable
mental tables of their arrival and failure. She wasn't running off
amidst a riot that broke out during a particularly militant protest of
an Amnesty International splinter group. She sat there as police moved
in with their bulky, comically sci-fi riot gear, mother and father
desperately searching for her. She appeared on no less than three news
feeds, the calm center of the local fraction of global chaos, mother and
father looking on, stunned. Within two weeks, all three of them were dead.

<p class=drop>Rand examines the back of the walk-in refrigerator, long
since out of power; the insulated walls are warm to the
touch. He finds a spring catch for a manual release which opens an
antiquated physical mechanism, a door to an emergency shelter.

Narrow concrete steps leading down to what is little more than a cramped
basement, canned supplies including vast quantities of spam - the
allegedly edible variety and bottled water - but not self-cooling,
All of it older than he is, this panic hoarding having been popular with
a certain strain of
eco-survivalist who thought the climate shifts were going to do them in
before the economics or the human reactions did.

Under an olive drab tarp, an early solar-powered electric car, probably
not particularly fast, but
still in working order. It will have to do. He hikes up another set of
stairs and releases the catch on
a latch in a trapdoor that leads outside the diner. He rolls the
Multi-Film<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> into binoculars, dials up the magnification and scans.
Razor-edged horizon slipped between desert and the wheeling shoals of
clouds tacked to a block of blue sky.

<i>The family was always on vacation. People never took pictures of just
being, not back then. Or, if they did, they didn't put them in albums.
Pictures were special then. It wasn't recording everything as it
happened, it was recording what you wanted to remember. He hasn't ever
given them names; they are simply placeholders in the atomic age
nuclear family, their faces and hair colors shifting while the
essence of their meaning remains the same. Father under sun-bleached
white of desert sky, Cabazon, big dinosaurs.
Mother holds Daughter who is young and making a face at the camera, Son
holds plastic miniature versions of the two behemoths in the background,
one T-Rex and one Brontosaurus. Though the Brontosaurus was a mistake,
wrong head on the wrong body, he looked it up, in the Farm, on what
they called microfiche.</i>

The skin of the vehicle whorls with mad-trip colors, absorbing the sun,
the outside has become a Panorama blue screen projection, panels of
motion somehow much removed from the interior and not a part of Rand's
immediate present. He is the lone car on the interstate, traveling
through the dust bowl, along this road that once might have
carried his picture book family. 
<i>Oldsmobile
Futurematic. Futurematic combines beauty with utility... styling with a
purpose. Hydromatic drive! The smart way. The Futurematic way. The
Oldsmobile way. Futurematic is a brand new word, created to describe this brand new,
post-war, General Motors' car. </i>
Now he drives past the
sagging lines that once were necessary to carry communication, their
shadows forming a lattice between the dry tufts of yellow grass that
shoot up through the old road.

This sun-powered car he drives now has no new words to describe it,
affords
no psychic real estate that he knows of. It is too old to have its own
HUD so, he has stuck the MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> to the
windshield. Her GPS
still
radiating on the screen, but fainter now as she reaches for the coast...
He remembers reading about white line fever and prays that it might
visit him now as the endless klicks unfurl in monotony around him.

<p class=drop>She was one week out of Rio when he found her, wet and
feral and
smelling of the septic, flooded barrios of that old and tangled city.
Her name a passion, a curse, a guttural expulsion. Why she had come
here, she wouldn't say. Weeks spent trying to adjust twin pairs of Sony
ear-bead translators to the twists of her patois. But nights, their
sweat drenched skin clung together; he imagined he could smell the
orange and fish scent of the markets on her, mystery of jungles in her
own dark, pubic curls. Lying there, under the ceiling fan of a
broke-down hotel, she would unfold childhoods both confusing and utterly
fascinating, all the dark mystery of a stratified society of commerce
and savagery down there in the heart of Brazil. She described a place
that had gone back to more primal ways long before the rest of the
world. He could imagine her sometimes looking out to the slips of beach,
eyes finding the coastline, the suggestion of the sea and all that might
lie beyond.

He'd heard rumors of cults and human sacrifice, of street gangs mad with
cheap meth roaming the canals, river rat gangs on Jet Ski's tearing
through the heart of overindulged myth, Aztec fantasies and paranoid
memes. Rio had been virtually cut off from the mediated world for years
now, and nobody much cared to investigate. So suspicions went there to
dream and ferment, and one of them, he suspected, had become her. Grown
in the dark curls of hair, twisting strands of genetic code had rooted
and grown, producing this girl, with her coppery skin, her aquatic eyes,
her mind subject to its own, ever shifting, unstable mental winds.

He might imagine them, from time to time, these two women in his life,
like the fall of a camera's shutter, dividing then from now, before from
after. His sister and this strange woman from a stranger land. The one
before, the one after, and the bridge of self he had formed in between
seemed so inadequate and ad-hoc now. A person more likely imagined by
the aggregate imagination of the two of them, clinging as he did to the
pursuit of the one that was still alive and the memories of the one who
wasn't. A dream of a thing called Rand, flipping through the sun faded
days of a century long gone, through smiles, years dead, tints in
flushed cheeks stripped by decades' faded hue. A world comprised of
promising thrusts of architecture, of Muffler men thirty feet high, of
all night Bowling alleys described in neon, of Tomorrowland at
Disneyland, of Eames furniture played out as the space age equivalent of
Lucite kitsch. There, Father, red haired this time, Mother pregnant, the
children merely possibilities now, standing in front of the Big Boy, his
perm-a-grin suggesting some compulsory happiness, some fascist
cheerfulness in the aggressive upsweep of his Brylcreemed coif, hefting
his burger above as some capitalist trophy. Or, the whole family
standing in front of a Sputnik parodied satellite atop a road sign,
spikes every-which way, the dream folded and folded upon itself again,
kaleidoscope origami.

She would catch him sometimes, when he would sit in the bay window of
the house abandoned near the sea line, the sound of the surf, paging
through the days of the family. And she would laugh and make fun of him
in Portuguese and English, laugh at him for the fondness he had for that
dead century and its people. Laughing, Rand took it, at his need for his
surrogate pantheon in these faded pages in their kitschy binder, for his
inability to form a Rand divorced from the sad tomorrow land their
futures had become. While she, with her lean muscles and erratic
behavior, stalked the atavistic Serengeti's of her mind, finding older
cores to build upon. So fucking lonely, so fucking American she would
say, as if the word had meaning anymore.

Out here, amongst the scrub and hollowed towns, they collected
e-waste, once, a futile attempt at early recovery. Mounds of obsolete
computers, PDA's, televisions and other electronics harvested for the
copper and any other reuseable parts had accumulated, an economy of
subsistence. Started by eco-hippies as first, the e-waste had once gone
to third world countries where villages would burn the refuse to get at
the valuable scrap, inhaling PVC's, cadmium, lead. But soon it became a
domestic franchise, the re-farming of machine dreams, IT engineers,
programmers, high priests of tech who had to give up their white collars
to be drawn out, backs to the sun, working under masks, columns of smoke
rising into the sky, eking out some semblance of an existence, trying to
resurrect lives.
He had seen that sort of desperation, back in Florida, before the storms
hit. The town already collapsing under the weight of economic failure.
Empty storefronts becoming ersatz shrines for those who were taken in by
the sudden urge to find God, the big fix paradigm. One crazy sect he had
seen projected their crucified holo-Jesus over neo-flagellants, slung
over the street as some disturbing, displaced Macy's float like Rand had
seen on television.Faint ripples of maxized bandwidth creeping over the
Jesus's wet, slick
flesh, hinting at organs seeking to push through the wound of the unseen
Roman spear. Men were stripped to their waists, flailing themselves in
front of their pitiable Lord hung from his neon cross. There, the Jesus
lolled its head as if in some opiate slumber of pain and religious
ecstasy, his final moment of apotheosis come, in this, his last
submission to the physical form. Rand winced as the ball bearings tore
into the men's flesh, his father pulling him further down the street
away from the display. The Lord sputtered in and out, and became
intangible above him. He had asked his father why they did this, and his
Father said because the men were in futures, and the market was bad for
futures now. Rand figured any fool could see that. His father had
laughed and said that wasn't what he meant. The next day, the Jesus and
the men were gone.

Her trail continues along through the transparency of the screen. He is,
he thinks, perhaps gaining too close a proximity to her. Best for her to
know that he follows, but not so close as for her to panic. He wonders
if those eyes stare from beneath their marine depths to watch him
watching her on some MultiFilm<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> of her own.
Observe this game that he imagines she too still plays, remembering the
times he has tracked her down before. She had always let him catch up
before.

She never settled into his life. He'd wake nights; watch her through
the floor-to-ceiling window as the tide came in, brown ankles in the
surf, huddled in a frayed duvet washed too many times, and invariably
she was looking south.

He could see her tension, at the parties, forming at the corners of her
mouth, conversation tinkling around the backyard of a fashionable house
in a gated suburb. People talking recovery and opportunity and hopeful
buzz words like nanotech, bio-growth, market-states, but never any of
it coming to anything more then drunken speculation. He'd watch her
across the concrete patio, the light refracted from the blue plane of
water played over her. Mentally she was already gone. His friends had
never really been hers, or really his he supposes, just people
collected through work, which was itself an abstraction. The next
night, when he woke, she wasn't on the beach and her bag was gone. In
the morning, he left in pursuit.


A skirmish line of broken hotels along a beach. The property, once so
prized, now chipped at, worn down by accumulated tides, left to ruin. A
few feral dogs pick through the old structures, some nothing but
foundation, others holding the reinforced concrete shells of multiple
stories, scrubbed paint, empty windows. Old anodized chain-link fence
pokes out of the tide line, tsunami ideograms warn of catastrophes that
might have come a few years back. Rand removes his shoes, which squelch
and morph to a more relaxed size as he does, the sand wet under his
feet, padding his way down the shore.

Further on he can see a man, brown from the sun. Rand has crested a hill
and watches him below. He wears tattered cargo pants cut at the ankles
and carries a sturdily made wooden rake. He has fashioned the beach into
the precisely combed concentric waves of a Zen garden. Beach rocks
serving as the locus of their radiation outward, he has fashioned his
own movement so that his footprints do not disturb the whirling patterns
he has traced. He is almost done. The tide creeping ever closer, his
ephemera creation soon to be carried away in much the slow, deliberate
process as it was made.

Perhaps twenty meters away from him, atop the same rise, the man climbs
and watches as the waves lap and blur the lines in the sand, the garden,
until only the rocks remain. He then lights a fire he has prepared and
walks to Rand, offering a cigarette. Rand accepts, and by the fire, they
smoke. The man covered in sand, clinging to the wet of his body, a red
bandana gone black above his brow. Up close Rand can see that he is
perhaps Polynesian. In any case, he doesn't seem to speak English, and
so they sit in silence. They finish their cigarettes, and Rand shows the
man his map. On it, the trail of her signal has led here, paused, and
then gone south. There was a port here, according to the map, but no
structures Rand has seen suggest so. Much of the current topographical
data can be unreliable these days. He pulls up a picture of her and
shows it to the gardener who nods, points south, and takes the map from
Rand. The man's fingers work over the worn film, his nails surprisingly
well-manicured, and he returns it to Rand, a new map keyed in one corner
window to another port, or perhaps the right one all along. Ten miles
south, her GPS pulses once more and then cools, fading over the Pacific.
She has, he realizes, finally turned it off. They sleep by the fire, and
the sand makes Rand dream of the scratchy surplus blankets huddled under
at the Farm. Communal barracks, morning shower, cafeteria meals,
everything regulated but not uncomfortably so.

He trades the old solar powered car for passage on a Tasmanian freighter
headed south. He maneuvers onto the gangway through the brine scent of
ocean air and the press of travelers, merchant marines and freight
haulers. Shipping has become suddenly vogue given the cost of most air
freight these days, the west coast not yet having been hit by that wave
of prosperous recovery the news feeds claimed was rolling over from the
east. Rand unrolls his MultiFilm one more time, but she hasn't turned
her signal back on. She won't, she has dug herself out from the membrane
of connectivity now, slipped south now and quite probably gone.

<i>His hands run over the rusted hull as the ship sets to port,
reassured
by its solidity. He imagines that perhaps the Son might be there, on a
single frame of old Kodak, right next to him, bleached color of that
era's film stock, his olive drab uniform that much more so. The next
picture reveals the family gathered along the dock. Today their hair is
predominantly blond, the Mother and Father just that bit older as Son is
seen off to a strange tropical land they've never heard of, but always,
they can believe, for the best of causes. Rocket trajectories,
satellites, smooth, flowing, Futurmatic lines And here in these two
frames, at the end of the book, the nuclear family fissions and begins
to part. They become the fast-motion images of desert test sites and
mocked up homes blown to atomic winds. Coca-cola signs gone to tinny
rust, Googie coffee shops plowed under yellow Tonka monsters, tiki gods
desiccated from lack of worshippers, Apollo capsules burnt to dust on
re-entry. It begins with a son, putting to port for a faraway land,
coastline of home receding behind him.</i>

[*ITEM] Emigration

[*AUTHOR] Liam&nbsp;Baldwin

[*BLURB] Emigrate! Get a new life!

[*DESCRIPTION]  
<p class=drop>Alvi Emigrated on Tuesday.  He and Kate had argued, had
another of their real door-slamming, throwing things, screaming at each
other to the point of incoherence, yelling matches on the Friday night
and were still not on speaking terms four days later. It looked as though
their tempestuous five year, on-and-off-and-on again relationship had
finally come to an end. He couldn't remember what had sparked this
particular row.  He never could. Some small seed, a innocent chance
remark miscontrued had blossomed in the festering fertile soil of their
mutual dependency and loathing into a row that had gone on long into the
night. All the old tropes were rehearsed yet again, the same old
rituals of blame and counter blame, accusation and exaggeration, and
somewhere in the middle of it all he had a blinding moment of
clarity - later he would describe it as <i>a revelation</i> - when it
suddenly came to him that he was bored.  Bored with his job.  Bored with
his life. Bored with Kate. Bored with this argument. Bored with finding
that fighting with Kate, the only relief from his boredom, had now, in
itself, become boring.

He marched into the downtown Emigration offices the next morning and
filled out the forms in a mad rush. The sour-faced receptionist at the
desk had gone through them with meticulous attention and then passed him
onto another clerk who had shown him into the first of a bewildering
succession of interview rooms and medical examination booths where he
was questioned, re-questioned,  prodded, and poked by a seemingly
endless procession of humourless, pallid, office-bound troglodytes.
Name. Age. Occupation. National Identity Number. Interlog number. This
number. That number. Think of a number.  "How many fingers am I holding
up?" Retina scan. Fingerprints. "Spit in the bottle and hold still while
I take a tissue sample from... thank you, now drop your pants, bend
over, and read the chart..."

<div class=lpullquote>"Don't want you getting to Colony
Dirtbowl Shithole Four, sobering up, and changing your mind now, do we?
Not when there's no way back."</div>The process was a long, frustrating,
humiliating
experience. Only his
determination to go had carried him through.  After being asked the same
set of meaningless questions for the fifth time, he formulated the idea
that most of the stuff he was asked to submit to was there merely to
weed out the weak-hearted and the weak-willed.  Emigration didn't really
need fifteen separate DNA samples from him and the names of all his
Great Great Grandparents, it was an exercise in winnowing.  Put up with
this bullshit, he realised, and you made the grade. Get angry and leave
and you obviously weren't going to make it on a frontier world. He
gritted his teeth and submitted to the tedium of reciting his National
Identity Number again and again.

At the end of three hours he found himself sitting alone in a small
green-walled, clock-free cubicle wearing nothing but a hospital gown
which, being far too small for him, didn't meet at the back.  The only
seat in the room was a cold metal bench that vibrated slightly. He
suspected it was refrigerated.

The curtain swished back and a medically dressed orderly handed him a
bag containing his clothes and thrust a clipboard under his nose.
"Sign here!" he said.

Alvi signed. The orderly checked off a box on another sheet on the
clipboard and turned to go.

"Hey wait," Alvi said. "What happens now?  I've been sitting here
freezing my nuts for an hour now, am I finished or what?  Did I pass?"

"Oh yeah, we're through with you. You passed. Come back next Tuesday."

"What?"

"Next Tuesday.  Back. Come," the orderly repeated with sarcasm so heavy
you could almost hear it hit the floor.

Alvi had a very strong temptation to punch the man in the face. "Yes..."
he said, " I understand what you just said.  I just don't understand why
you said it. If I'm passed for Emigration why can't I just go now?"

The orderly rolled his eyes,  sighed theatrically and explained, in the
tone of voice usually reserved for idiot children, that there was a
mandatory four day cooling-off period. "Don't want you getting to Colony
Dirtbowl Shithole Four, sobering up, and changing your mind now, do we?
Not when there's no way back."

Alvi dressed in sullen silence.  It was raining when he left the building.

The sullen silence followed him home and was already permeating the
apartment when he arrived.  Kate was watching TV.  She didn't look up
when he came in, though she could hardly fail to have noticed him enter.
He stood at their shared living room doorway looking at her, wondering
for a moment if there wasn't a way back.   He took a breath but before
he could speak she raised her arm, pointed the remote, and turned up the
TV volume.  Placatory words that had been forming in his mouth turned to
a grunt of disgust.  He didn't bother again.  He wasn't sure if he had
been going to tell her about his decision to emigrate but he wouldn't
now.  There was no need to.  She would never know anyway - even after he
had gone.

He phoned in sick on Wednesday and spent the next two days
relocating his apartment. Luck was with him and he found a short-term
commune over on Bleakerstrasse that would take him on as a probationer.
He waited till Friday - and waited till Kate had gone to work - before
he detached his half of their shared living unit and moved it across the
city.  He didn't leave a forwarding address.

<p class=drop>On Saturday, the cooling off period spent, he presented
himself to the
Emigration Bureau on Bleakerstrasse.  The offices were plusher than the
utilitarian hell hole that he has visited four days before.  Somehow,
amazingly, the split with Kate had landed him in a nicer neighbourhood.

The doors slid shut behind him with a soft whoosh, deadening the street
noise to a muted background hum. He walked across the deep-carpeted
foyer to the reception desk. The girl was ravishingly beautiful; tall
with blonde hair that fell to her shoulders in loose, natural waves. The
simple Emigration uniform looked elegant and stylish on her. She looked
up as he approached and smiled her perfect, reception desk smile at him.

"Hello," she said. "Welcome to Emigration."

"Hi, I want to... Emigrate," Alvi said. The words came out flat and
clumsy. He felt suddenly tongue-tied before this woman's
beauty.

"No problem, I'll just get you to fill in a few forms and then we..."

"Oh. I've done that already," he interrupted. He fumbled his copy of the 
forms out of his wallet.
"Sorry, they're a little folded now. I registered four days ago and filled them
out, but..." his voice trailed off.

"The cooling-off period. You wanted time to think about it.  It's a big
step. We don't ever want anyone to regret Emigrating." She took the
papers from him and glanced through them. She entered a string of
figures into her terminal, fingers moving with a bewildering speed. "Be
with you in a sec," she smiled,
"Just have to access your account here..." she bent her head to her
keyboard and typed again.

Was it a big step? Alvi thought.  Everyone he knew had Emigrated at
least once and everyone he knew had expressed a sense of disappointment
once they had gone through with it. He looked around the plush reception
area then back at the girl. Emma. He read her name tag as she processed
the paperwork. <i>Emma Stanton - Embarkation Officer - Emigration</i>.
The
badge was black with silver lettering. It was clipped to the front of
her blouse. The blouse was metallic grey and the fabric gaped slightly
between two of the buttons. He could see the smooth curve of her right
breast. She looked up and he was momentarily flustered to be caught
staring at her chest. She smiled again and gathered up the papers.

"Well, everything seems to be fine with these. Would you care to follow
me?" She stood and moved away from the desk. Another woman appeared, as
if from nowhere, to take her place.

"This way," said Emma Stanton and led him through a double door into
another part of the building. The atmosphere was more clinical beyond
the reception area, the lighting harsher, the carpet replaced by clean
floortiles. She led him down a long corridor; doors led off both sides
at irregular intervals. They passed a small waiting area with chairs and
the latest celeb magazines scattered on a small table. It was all as
quiet and well furnished as the reception area but there was the
disturbing metallic tang of ozone in the air and, behind the walls, he
heard the high potential hum of vast, powerful machinery. Emma Stanton
led him to one of the smooth, blank doors. There was a small number by
the door handle otherwise it was unmarked. Room 247.

"After you," she said.  The door obediently opened for them. The room
was not as he had expected. Not as depicted in the movies. There was no
high-backed chair with straps and manacles. No white-coated technicians
tending rows of complex machinery. There was very little in the room at
all: a ceiling-high, cylindrical, glass and metal device stood at one
end of the room and a terminal desk at the other. The terminal looked
like a miniature version of the reception desk they had just left. Emma
completed the illusion by sitting at the chair and logging in.

"Is that it?" he asked, pointing at the glass cylinder.

"That's it." she said.

"It looks like my shower at home. I was expecting... I don't know what I
was expecting."

"You were expecting something a little more complex. I know. Like in the
movies. Old stereotypes die hard."

He looked at the machine again. That was it. That was Emigration. It
looked like his shower. There was one button on the wall at the back of
the cylinder. It was red. A big red button on the wall.

"Do I press that?" he asked, moving towards it.

"Yes, but not yet. A few more formalities to go through first." She
angled a small cam towards him with a well-manicured finger. No wedding
rings, he noticed. Not one. Not that that meant anything these days. He
knew many married people who didn't advertise the fact. Even some in
Polys chose not to wear the usual multiple rings to show how many
spouses they had.

"Look into the cam," she said, "and please state your name."
He did so.

"Do you undertake this Emigration of your own free will and state that
you are under no coercion or threat forcing to take this action?"

<i>I am? I do? How am I supposed to answer that?</i> he thought, before
finally simply saying; "Yes."

"You understand that by entering Emigration an identical copy of
yourself will be created on the Colony planet of..." she glanced at her
screen, "Zogarian Delta seven. This identical copy will be identical to
you in every way. It will have your body, your face, your thoughts, and
your memories - even the memory of entering this building and the memory
of this conversation. The copy will be you. One of you will step out of
this room into an alien world. Do you understand this?"

Yes he understood. Everyone understood. It was how the colonies were
populated. Long range drone ships took years to reach possible new
Earths, their only cargo a quantum entangled matter transmitter. Once a
new, habitable (however vaguely you described it) planet had been found
the matter transmitter was deployed and its twin back on earth uncrated.
At first a few simple machines were sent through,  The simple machines
built a larger matter transmitter, then the complex machines were sent
through, then the colonists. It was a one way trip.

"You will not be permitted to return. Once you have Emigrated you will
never be able to return to Earth. Do you understand that?"

"Yes," he said. He felt strangely dislocated as if he were making a
decision that wasn't going to affect him in any way - yet it would
irrevocably affect him for the rest of his life. He thumbprinted the pad
where she indicated. She keyed in a few more instructions before
blanking the screen.

"That's it," she said. "You are ready to go.  Watch your step when you
get there. According to the screen, Zog D seven has a slightly lower
gravity than Earth and a higher atmospheric oxygen.  It might take a few
days to adjust."

"I'll be careful," he said.

She led him over to the Emigration Machine. He stepped inside and took a
deep breath. In a moment he would press the big red button 
and step out into a new and alien planet
halfway across the galaxy - and he would step back out of this very
machine as if nothing had happened. <i>I'm about to give birth to
myself,</i>
he thought.

His finger hesitated half way to the button.

"Just one thing," he turned to her. "My <i>quantum twin</i> - just how
entangled with me is he? I mean, if he gets drunk do I get the
hangover?"

Emma smiled. It was a very pretty smile and he felt a regret that he
would never see it again, and he thought he would ask her out.
<i>Tomorrow
night,</i> he thought, <i>that new place down at the waterfront.</i> He
decided
to ask her after he pressed the button.  If she said yes, he wasn't sure
if he would be able to leave and not go on the date.

"No, your copy isnt entangled with you in any way." she said. "The
machine on Zogarian Delta seven has components that are entangled with
identical components in this machine but your copy - your <i>twin</i>,
as
you
put it - will be made from elements, raw materials, mined locally on the
planet. There is no way they can be entangled with the matter in your
body. There is no way you can get your <i>twin's</i> hangover, or be
forced
to commit a murder, or do silly things in embarrassing situations.
That's all good fun in the movies but there's no chance of it in
reality. You will have no entanglement."

"And you?" he asked. "Any entanglements?"

She hesitated for a moment before replying.	"No," she said with another
smile. The smile was genuine. She looked into his eyes. "No
entanglements."

He pressed the button.

<p class=drop>And it vanished.  He suddenly found himself looking at a
blank wall. He
felt dizzy, took a step back and stumbled. He fell - slowly.

<i>Oh my god!</i> he thought, <i>I'm here.  Lower gravity - higher
atmospheric
oxygen.  I'm somewhere else!</i>

Someone caught him.  Arms supported him, steadied him, stood him on his
feet again. The momentary nausea and panic passed and he turned round.

She was wearing coveralls.  Her hair was short, cut back in a practical
but attractive crop.  They looked at each other for a moment, then she
smiled.

"Hello, Emma," he said.

[*ITEM] Voyage to the Moon

[*AUTHOR] Lucian (Loukianos) 
[*BLURB] Lucian was a Syrian author, born about the year 120 AD.
This translation is by Thomas Francklin, an English cleric, in the 
eighteenth century. 
Just a short extract from Lucian's early work in the sf field. He refreshingly
confessed to being a liar, which boast, I feel, is amply borne out. The tale, which runs
to a very large number of words, is characterised by a very lively imagination, assisted
by Greek mythology and Homeric sagas, as
you will see, and forms the origin of many later fantasies from Bergerac to Swift.<br /><br /> 
<small>Underlined sections deliver a pop-up commentary.</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]  

<P class=drop>We left them 
<u onmouseover="Tip('We join Lucian somewhat after his' +
' courageous departure from the Mediterranean' +
' into the Atlantic Ocean, then an entirely' +
' unknown quantity. Ed. ')">and returned to our companions in the ship.</u>
  We then
took our casks, filled some of them with water, and some with wine
from the river, slept one night on shore, and the next morning set
sail, the wind being very moderate.  About noon, the island being
now out of sight, on a sudden a most violent whirlwind arose, and
carried the ship above three thousand stadia, lifting it up above
the water, from whence it did not let us down again into the seas
but kept us suspended in mid air, in this manner we hung for
seven days and nights, and on the eighth beheld a large tract of
land, like an island, round, shining, and remarkably full of
light; we got on shore, and found on examination that it was
cultivated and full of inhabitants, though we could not then see any
of them.  As night came on other islands appeared, some large,
others small, and of a fiery colour; there was also below these
another land with seas, woods, mountains, and cities in it, and this
we took to be our native country:  as we were advancing forwards, we
were seized on a sudden by the Hippogypi, for so it seems they
were called by the inhabitants; these Hippogypi are men carried upon
vultures, which they ride as we do horses.  These vultures have each
three heads, and are immensely large; you may judge of their size
when I tell you that one of their feathers is bigger than the mast
of a ship.  The Hippogypi have orders, it seems, to fly round the
kingdom, and if they find any stranger, to bring him to the king:
they took us therefore, and carried us before him.  As soon as he
saw us, he guessed by our garb what we were.  

"You are Grecians,"	said he, "are you not?"  

We told him we were.  

"And how," added he,
"got ye hither through the air?"  

We told him everything that had
happened to us; and he, in return, related to us his own history,
and informed us, that he also was a man, that his name was Endymion,
that he had been taken away from our earth in his sleep, and
brought to this place where he reigned as sovereign.  That spot,
he told us, which now looked like a moon to us, <u onmouseover="Tip('Advanced thinking for the time')"> was the earth</u>.
He desired us withal not to make ourselves uneasy, for that we
should soon have everything we wanted.  "If I succeed," says he, "in
the war which I am now engaged in against the inhabitants of the
sun, you will be very happy here."  

We asked him then what enemies
he had, and what the quarrel was about?  

"Phaeton," he replied, "who
is king of the sun (<u onmouseover="Tip('The 1780 translator, while prepared'+
' to believe inhabitants on the moon,'+
' doubts whether the sun is habitable.')">for that is inhabited as well as the
moon</u>), has been at war with us for some time past.  The foundation
of it was this:  I had formerly an intention of sending some of the
poorest of my subjects to establish a colony in Lucifer, which was
uninhabited:  but Phaeton, out of envy, put a stop to it, by
opposing me in the mid-way with his Hippomyrmices; we were
overcome and desisted, our forces at that time being unequal to
theirs.  I have now, however, resolved to renew the war and fix my
colony; if you have a mind, you shall accompany us in the
expedition; I will furnish you everyone with a royal vulture and
other accoutrements; we shall set out to-morrow."  

"With all my
heart," said I, "whenever you please."  

<p class=drop>We stayed, however, and
supped with him; and rising early the next day, proceeded with the
army, when the spies gave us notice that the enemy was approaching.
The army consisted of a hundred thousand, besides the scouts and
engineers, together with the auxiliaries, amongst whom were eighty
thousand Hippogypi, and twenty thousand who were mounted on the
Lachanopteri; these are very large birds, whose feathers are
of a kind of herb, and whose wings look like lettuces.  Next to
these stood the <u onmouseover="Tip('Millet throwers')"> Cinchroboli</u>, 
and the <u onmouseover="Tip('Garlic warriors')">Schorodomachi</u>. Our
allies from the north were three thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Flea archers')">Psyllotoxotae</u> and
five thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Wind runners')">Anemodromi</u>; the former take their names from the
fleas which they ride upon, every flea being as big as twelve
elephants; the latter are foot-soldiers, and are carried about in
the air without wings, in this manner:  they have large gowns
hanging down to their feet, these they tuck up and spread in a form
of a sail, and the wind drives them about like so many boats:  in
the battle they generally wear targets.  It was reported that
seventy thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Acorn sparrows')">Strathobalani</u> from the stars over Cappadocia
were to be there, together with five thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Horse cranes')">Hippogerani</u>; 
these I did not see, for they never came:  I shall not attempt,
therefore, to describe them; of these, however, most wonderful
things were related.

Such were the forces of Endymion; their arms were all alike; their
helmets were made of beans, for they have beans there of a
prodigious size and strength, and their scaly breast-plates of
lupines sewed together, for the skins of their lupines are like a
horn, and impenetrable; their shields and swords the same as our
own.

<div class=pullquote>they use shields made of
mushrooms, and spears of the stalks of asparagus</div>The army ranged themselves in this manner:  the right wing was
formed by the Hippogypi, with the king, and round him his chosen
band to protect him, amongst which we were admitted; on the left
were the Lachanopteri; the auxiliaries in the middle, the foot were
in all about sixty thousand myriads.  They have spiders, you must
know, in this country, in infinite numbers, and of pretty large
dimensions, each of them being as big as one of the islands of the
Cyclades; these were ordered to cover the air from the moon quite to
the morning star; this being immediately done, and the field of
battle prepared, the infantry was drawn up under the command of
Nycterion, the son of Eudianax.

The left wing of the enemy, which was commanded by Phaeton himself,
consisted of the Hippomyrmices; these are large birds, and resemble
our ants, except with regard to size, the largest of them covering
two acres; these fight with their horns and were in number about
fifty thousand.  In the right wing were the <u onmouseover="Tip('Air flies')">Aeroconopes</u>, about
five thousand, all archers, and riding upon large gnats.  To these
succeeded the <u onmouseover="Tip('Air dancers')">Aerocoraces</u>, light infantry, but remarkably
brave and useful warriors, for they threw out of slings exceeding
large radishes, which whoever was struck by, died immediately, a
most horrid stench exhaling from the wound; they are said, indeed,
to dip their arrows in a poisonous kind of mallow.  Behind these
stood ten thousand Caulomycetes, heavy-armed soldiers, who
fight hand to hand; so called because they use shields made of
mushrooms, and spears of the stalks of asparagus.  Near them were
placed the Cynobalani, about five thousand, who were sent by
the inhabitants of Sirius; these were men with dog's heads, and
mounted upon winged acorns:  some of their forces did not arrive in
time; amongst whom there were to have been some slingers from the
Milky-way, together with the <u onmouseover="Tip('Cloud centaurs')">Nephelocentauri</u>; they indeed came
when the first battle was over, and I wish they had never come
at all:  the slingers did not appear, which, they say, so enraged
Phaeton that he set their city on fire.

Thus prepared, the enemy began the attack:  the signal being given,
and the asses braying on each side, for such are the trumpeters they
make use of on these occasions, the left wing of the Heliots, unable
to sustain the onset of our Hippogypi, soon gave way, and we pursued
them with great slaughter:  their right wing, however, overcame our
left.  The Aeroconopes falling upon us with astonishing force, and
advancing even to our infantry, by their assistance we recovered;
and they now began to retreat, when they found the left wing had
been beaten.  The defeat then becoming general, many of them were
taken prisoners and many slain; the blood flowed in such abundance
that the clouds were tinged with it and looked red, just as they
appear to us at sunset; from thence it distilled through upon the
earth.  Some such thing, I suppose, happened formerly amongst the
gods, which made Homer believe that Jove rained blood at the
death of Sarpedon.

<p class=drop>When we returned from our pursuit of the enemy we set up two
trophies; one, on account of the infantry engagement in the spider's
web, and another in the clouds, for our battle in the air.  Thus
prosperously everything went on, when our spies informed us that the
Nephelocentaurs, who should have been with Phaeton before the
battle, were just arrived:  they made, indeed, as they approached
towards us, a most formidable appearance, being half winged horses
and half men; the men from the waist upwards, about as big as the
Rhodian Colossus, and the horses of the size of a common ship of
burthen.  I have not mentioned the number of them, which was really
so great, that it would appear incredible:  they were commanded by
Sagittarius, from the Zodiac.  As soon as they learned that
their friends had been defeated they sent a message to Phaeton to
call him back, whilst they put their forces into order of battle,
and immediately fell upon the <u onmouseover="Tip('Moon-dwellers. H.G.Wells used the same term for his moon people')">Selenites</u>, who were unprepared
to resist them, being all employed in the division of the spoil;
they soon put them to flight, pursued the king quite to his own
city, and slew the greatest part of his birds; they then tore down
the trophies, ran over all the field woven by the spiders, and
seized me and two of my companions.  Phaeton at length coming up,
they raised other trophies for themselves; as for us, we were
carried that very day to the palace of the Sun, our hands bound
behind us by a cord of the spider's web.

The conquerors determined not to besiege the city of the Moon, but
when they returned home, resolved to build a wall between them and
the Sun, that his rays might not shine upon it; this wall was double
and made of thick clouds, so that the moon was always eclipsed, and
in perpetual darkness.  Endymion, sorely distressed at these
calamities, sent an embassy, humbly beseeching them to pull down the
wall, and not to leave him in utter darkness, promising to pay them
tribute, to assist them with his forces, and never more to rebel; he
sent hostages withal.  Phaeton called two councils on the affair, at
the first of which they were all inexorable, but at the second
changed their opinion; a treaty at length was agreed to on these
conditions:

<i>The Heliots and their allies on one part, make the following
agreement with the Selenites and their allies on the other:<b> "That
the Heliots shall demolish the wall now erected between them, that
they shall make no irruptions into the territories of the Moon; and
restore the prisoners according to certain articles of ransom to be
stipulated concerning them; that the Selenites shall permit all the
other stars to enjoy their rights and privileges; that they shall
never wage war with the Heliots, but assist them whenever they shall
be invaded; that the king of the Selenites shall pay to the king of
the Heliots an annual tribute of ten thousand casks of dew, for the
insurance of which, he shall send ten thousand hostages; that they
shall mutually send out a colony to the Morning-star, in which,
whoever of either nation shall think proper, may become a member;
that the treaty shall be inscribed on a column of amber, in the
midst of the air, and on the borders of the two kingdoms.  This
treaty was sworn to on the part of the Heliots, by Pyronides,
and Therites, and Phlogius; and on the part of the Selenites, by
Nyctor, and Menarus, and Polylampus."</b></i>

Such was the peace made between them; the wall was immediately
pulled down, and we were set at liberty.  When we returned to the
Moon, our companions met and embraced us, shedding tears of joy, as
did Endymion also.  He intreated us to remain there, or to go along
with the new colony; this I could by no means be persuaded to, but
begged he would let us down into the sea.  As he found I could not
be prevailed on to stay, after feasting us most nobly for seven
days, he dismissed us.

I will now tell you every thing which I met with in the Moon that
was new and extraordinary.  Amongst them, when a man grows old he
does not die, but dissolves into smoke and turns to air.  They all
eat the same food, which is frogs roasted on the ashes from a large
fire; of these they have plenty which fly about in the air, they get
together over the coals, snuff up the scent of them, and this serves
them for victuals.  Their drink is air squeezed into a cup, which
produces a kind of dew.

He who is quite bald is esteemed a beauty amongst them, for they
abominate long hair; whereas, in the comets, it is looked upon as a
perfection at least; so we heard from some strangers who were
speaking of them; they have, notwithstanding, small beards a little
above the knee; no nails to their feet, and only one great toe.
They have honey here which is extremely sharp, and when they
exercise themselves, wash their bodies with milk; this, mixed with a
little of their honey, makes excellent cheese. Their oil is
extracted from onions, is very rich, and smells like ointment.
Their wines, which are in great abundance, yield water, and the
grape stones are like hail; I imagine, indeed, that whenever the
wind shakes their vines and bursts the grape, then comes down
amongst us what we call hail.  They make use of their belly, which
they can open and shut as they please, as a kind of bag, or pouch,
to put anything in they want; it has no liver or intestines, but is
hairy and warm within, insomuch, that new-born children, when they
are cold, frequently creep into it.  The garments of the rich
amongst them are made of glass, but very soft:  the poor have woven
brass, which they have here in great abundance, and by pouring a
little water over it, so manage as to card it like wool.  I am
afraid to mention their eyes, lest, from the incredibility of the
thing, you should not believe me.  I must, however, inform you that
they have eyes which they take in and out whenever they please:  so
that they can preserve them anywhere till occasion serves, and then
make use of them; many who have lost their own, borrow from others;
and there are several rich men who keep a stock of eyes by them.
Their ears are made of the leaves of plane-trees, except of those
who spring, as I observed to you, from acorns, these alone have
wooden ones.  I saw likewise another very extraordinary thing in the
king's palace, which was a looking-glass that is placed in a well
not very deep; whoever goes down into the well hears everything that
is said upon earth, and if he looks into the glass, beholds all the
cities and nations of the world as plain as if he was close to them.
I myself saw several of my friends there, and my whole native
country; whether they saw me also I will not pretend to affirm.  He
who does not believe these things, whenever he goes there will know
that I have said nothing but what is true.

To return to our voyage.  We took our leave of the king and his
friends, got on board our ship, and set sail.  Endymion made me a
present of two glass robes, two brass ones, and a whole coat of
armour made of lupines, <u onmouseover="Tip('He refers here to a later adventure')">all which I left in the whale's belly</u>.
He likewise sent with us a thousand Hippogypi, who escorted us five
hundred stadia.

We sailed by several places, and at length reached the new colony of
the Morning-star, where we landed and took in water; from thence we
steered into the Zodiac; leaving the Sun on our left, we passed
close by his territory, and would have gone ashore, many of our
companions being very desirous of it, but the wind would not permit
us; we had a view, however, of that region, and perceived that it
was green, fertile, and well-watered, and abounding in everything
necessary and agreeable.  The Nephelocentaurs, who are mercenaries
in the service of Phaeton, saw us and flew aboard our ship, but,
recollecting that we were included into the treaty, soon departed;
the Hippogypi likewise took their leave of us.

[*ITEM] New Frankfurt

[*AUTHOR] Grant McDonald Walker 

[*BLURB] When a financial market becomes a city state, the
consequences may be shocking.

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>David was surprised that, at dusk and from a distance, New Frankfurt looked more like a medieval city than the twenty-first century construction that it actually was. From a road 
high on the rim of the Rhine gorge, he looked down on pale onion domes, burnished copper cupolas, precipitous marble  towers, slate-coated steeples, crenellated parapets, 
rough-hewn bastions and slender minarets which greatly outnumbered the few modern glass and steel office blocks. The buildings constituting the mass of the city were piled on 
to a bleak, rocky island in the river Rhine,  apparently at random, leaving none of the original island visible. The city was bluntly reflected in the steel grey water, the river's swells, 
eddies and assorted flotsam distorting the architecture into an inverted caricature of itself. Yet the ecclesiastical architecture was strictly decorative, as the only god regularly 
worshipped in New Frankfurt was Mammon. Nearly every building on the island was a merchant bank or other financial dealing house.

Flights of birds circled above the city, birds so distant and so numerous that they resembled wisps of smoke.

"I know you have never seen the place before, David," said Franz in his careful and perfect English, "But we should not be seen to take so much interest in New Frankfurt at this 
stage."

"Right." 

They returned to the silver-grey Audi electric, parked lopsidedly on the verge, and Franz drove away from the river. 

David said: "I hate these people."

"Yes, I can understand that. Elaine's hand. How is it now?"

"They've patched it up, but it'll never be perfectly OK again. She has restricted movement. She's doing nearly everything left-handed still. But we think it's improving."

"She is lucky. Of the twenty-four, the doctors cannot help sixteen. You must not think of revenge when you are on this mission, David. You have an important task. It must not be 
emotional."

"I only volunteered because of Elaine."

"And we value you, David. Very few of our people could have obtained a job and a visa to work there." Somehow, that sentence from Franz rang a little false, but when David 
glanced at him, Franz's pale face looked completely sincere, as always.

<div class=pullquote>We cannot rescue you if you get into trouble.</div>In truth, the banking sector was hard for a Brit to get into, now that it was dominated by Russian, Chinese and Middle Eastern money - not all of it precisely legitimate. Ever since 
the credit crisis of 2008, Western banks had been in decline, partly due to over-enthusiastic regulation, and the huge illicit economy was in need of laundry services. Getting a job 
in New Frankfurt (or The Island, as it was called in the financial community) was rarer still. New Frankfurt was the new Forbidden City. But David's area of expertise was a novel 
margin trading futures system of baroque complexity  which he had helped develop at Banque Vietnam in London. The bank wanted him at the heart of their New Frankfurt 
operation. Money talked, David walked. And he walked with a hidden purpose, working for the downfall of the city state.

Franz was talking again. "I shall take you to Wiesbaden. You will ride a train to Geisenheim and check into your hotel. From then, you are likely to be under surveillance. Arriving 
workers in New Frankfurt are checked many times in the early weeks. You are not the first spy sent there, and they have a harsh way with spies." 

David didn't ask what they did with spies. Last year, two Zodiac RIBs carrying twenty-four anti-capitalism protesters had landed on New Frankfurt's rocky shore, pasted notices on 
nearby buildings and chained themselves to railings. They had been unchained, arrested, anaesthetised, operated upon in the tiny private hospital, then released the same day. 
The ligaments of the right hand of each protester had been severed. Elaine had been one of them.

"You have our emergency telephone number in your memory?"

"Yes." 

"This number is a single-use mobile phone. Never use it unless you are desperate. There are no private cellular telephone connections in Europe today."

"Understood."

"And you realise, of course, that your own mobile telephone will not work on The Island?"

"Yes, it's quite common for mobiles to be blocked in dealing rooms, even in London and New York."

"Really? I didn't know that. And all is clear on the dead drop?"

"Yes, indeed."

"And you have your Zippo?"

"Of course." The Zippo, so called because of its resemblance to an antique cigarette lighter, was an inertial locator with a magic58 interface. In those fitness-conscious days, 
many people carried one. They calculated how many calories you consumed in your daily walking from place to place, climbing stairs and so on. They did it by measuring your 
body movements. David's Zippo, unusually, was also able to make a three dimensional map of where he had been, at what time, without the need for GPS.

"And do nothing at all for several weeks."

"I know."

"We cannot rescue you if you get into trouble. New Frankfurt is a foreign country, with its own laws and justice. It is a sovereign state and even America is afraid to punish them. 
These fools in our German Government allowed them to secede, hoping for advantage which never arrived. Now, the financial power of New Frankfurt means that it can bankrupt 
any power on Earth. You remember what happened to Nigeria when they defied New Frankfurt?"

"I do. And Nigeria has oil."

"But no country dares to buy it."

"Right."

Later, they parted in Wiesbaden without shaking hands, Franz slightly built and somehow bloodless, David a little fleshy and florid. The car door slammed, and Franz drove away 
without a backward glance, as though distancing himself. 


<p class=drop>The view David had of New Frankfurt from the South bank of the Rhine turned out to be his last view of The Island as a whole for some time. Only a few senior people were 
permitted to live on New Frankfurt. Real estate was concentrated in making money in dealing rooms and in head offices of major organisations basing themselves in New Frankfurt 
for tax purposes.  Day to day commuting from his hotel in Germany into Banque Vietnam in New Frankfurt took place entirely via a shuttle service of underground trains and 
subterranean pedestrian tunnels. He had no opportunity to climb to the surface of The Island, because access to everywhere was carefully monitored by his access ring. Every 
regular worker on The Island had one. The ring was issued to him on his first day, a translucent gem set in a yellow metal band, its depths sparkling with myriad microtechnology, 
and resembling a fire opal. He later discovered that the yellow metal was gold. Why not? It was rust-proof, hypo-allergenic, malleable and much cheaper than the electronic 
contents of the "opal".

Possession of a New Frankfurt access ring had become a status symbol among the world's financial community, keyed, as it was, to the individual wearer. Attempts had been 
made to reverse engineer the ring of a deceased wearer who had collapsed with a fatal heart attack while being "entertained" during a visit to Paris, but it had turned out to be far 
too complex to analyse, every one of the gleaming particles in the stone being a microchip, many of which were destroyed when the transparent capsule was broken. The source 
of the rich colours in the ring was the interference patterns set up by the wavelength-thin slices of silicon layered within.

His daily commute reminded David of the "Drain" - the ancient Waterloo and City underground line that served the City of London where he had worked before. The decorations 
were, however, of a much superior quality; clean design by Ferrari, brightly lit, and liberally served by moving walkways. Travel was, of course, free for ring wearers and all but 
prohibited for anyone else.

David obediently went about his employment in a regular fashion for nearly a month. Having established a pattern of boring conformity, he began his espionage. Every night, back 
at the hotel, David carefully dumped the Zippo maps of those corridors he managed to explore onto the nBook he kept in his hotel room. He annotated the maps with location 
descriptions, corridor numbers, business addresses, doors, cameras. These, in turn, were woven by the nBook into images downloaded from the net. He specialised in soft porn 
images to give any watcher a reason for his downloading them. Then he printed them on the shiny scraps of paper from the nBook's internal printer. These he crumpled up and 
discarded in the waste bin, from which they were to be rescued by one of Franz's agents, and scanned to extract the hidden map data.

David had expressed some doubt as to the usefulness of this mapping when it was first suggested to him, but Franz had explained it quite simply. Although the aerial view of New 
Frankfurt was by now well known, the geography below ground and the services that enabled The Island to maintain its autonomy were ill-understood. In particular, it was vital to 
know where the compact  nuclear power plant was located, and, more prosaically, where the water purification and sewage disposal facilities fitted in. David could see that any 
serious attempt by outside forces to seize New Frankfurt would require this and other details.

David's manager at Banque Vietnam was Mrs Chu, a Chinese woman, or, rather, you would have to say, "a Chinese lady". She was slight in
physique, and dressed in a suede suit and wore white calf-length boots like the love interest from a cowboy movie. She was meticulously made up in a pale, expressionless, 
manner. Mrs Chu was hard-faced and abrupt, and had halitosis that would strip paint at four metres. David had a great deal of difficulty with her English pronunciation and she 
always managed to give the impression that it was David's hearing or his comprehension of English that was at fault when he had to ask her to repeat some mangled expression. 
She never smiled. Occasionally, he would hear her give an unexpected strained giggle on the telephone when she spoke, he presumed to a relative, in Chinese. With David and 
his Albanian colleague, Zaf, she was all business to an almost offensive extent. And the bad breath seemed to make it worse. The more excited she became, the more obvious 
the halitosis. And you couldn't show it. And no-one would have dared to tell Mrs Chu.

Zaf was a preternaturally relaxed character, always draped over his chair; at one moment using a languid finger to buy an option on a few million Euros, at another, eating a sticky 
sweet cake and reading a music magazine. He contrived always to look as if he had shaved, carefully, exactly forty-eight hours ago. He appeared to dress in whatever he had 
found on the floor in his room that morning, usually grubby jeans, one of a selection of worn sweaters and a pair of threadbare Korean trainers, yet managed to look amazingly 
attractive at all times. Mrs Chu clearly couldn't reconcile Zaf's personal sloppiness with his clever ability to make a fortune for the bank by buying and selling currency, and she 
wasn't on his case as often as she was on David's.

On her desk, Mrs Chu kept an inlaid wooden box, which she seemed to regard with some reverence. Zaf said it was an antique Koyosegi Japanese puzzle box. She could 
sometimes be seen to open and close it without apparent effort, using slick automatic movements of her tiny fingers. David couldn't see how it was done even when he took the 
opportunity of Mrs Chu's absence to guiltily hold the box in his own hands. He became fascinated by it. In Mrs Chu's grip, it appeared to open by way of sliding panels, but they 
were all but invisible. It usually contained something small and hard, as he could detect by shaking it, but occasionally it seemed empty.

Work was routine. David's system was operated by a computer process that monitored trading patterns and recommended purchases and sales. In order to cloak the process 
from other financial instruments on the market, some recommended trades had to be ignored, while other counter-intuitive sales and purchases had to be made by the dealer 
himself. Mrs Chu found this deliberate flouting of the system's commands very hard to comprehend, but any system whose moves could accurately be predicted soon fell foul of 
someone else's counter-system. In the early days of software dealing, markets had been endangered by runaway programs all making the same decisions on the same market 
data.

The atmosphere on The Island was more sombre than in London, but there was still scope for levity among the dealers, of whom there were over two hundred on David's floor 
alone, at closely packed ranks of screen-strewn desks in a vast circular open plan office. Battles with paper darts and balloons were not unusual, especially among the 
Europeans.

But in the "public" areas, and even in the dealing rooms from time to time, the Security Guards were ever present. They tended to be large, fit men crammed into uniform blazers 
and flannels with white shirts and dark blue ties. They spoke poor English and German, and conversed together, which they did rarely, in some slavic language. Their purpose was 
evidently to intimidate by presence, and in this they were effective.

Three weeks of casual exploration and deliberate "getting lost" in the corridors under The Island served to map the areas accessible to David's access ring. The vast majority of 
entrances led to banking houses, eating houses and drinking houses. He managed to enter a few buildings by hitch-hiking on someone else's ring, but it was risky. He had to pick 
busy times when he could pass in and out in a crowd, otherwise he might get marooned in there. There remained a few, including the main security building and another entrance 
that only Security Guards seemed to use. There was no clue as to the location of the nuclear generator.

<p class=drop>It was Spring, and, one lunchtime, Zaf remarked on the good weather and suggested to David that they see the sunshine for a change. He led David to a dark stationery store 
room and punched a four digit number into a keypad on the wall. The unmistakeable sound of an electric servo motor came from above David's head, and a metal ladder appeared 
from a trap-door in the ceiling and slid into position.

"Plant Room," said Zaf, trotting up the ladder. "The code is 2029, the year of opening this office." David followed, and found himself in a huge thrumming space which evidently ran 
above the whole main dealing floor of the bank. Zaf pressed a button and the ladder retracted. David hardly had time to notice the huge air-con units, the ducting, the power supply 
boards, elevator motors and fire sprinkler systems looming in the shadows before Zaf was standing on a chair, opening an aluminium and glass skylight. "Come!" he called, and 
heaved himself through the aperture. David followed. 

He was standing on a steep walkway. For the first time, David discovered that the Banque Vietnam was roofed by an immense shallow dome like an inverted saucer. All around 
lay, or soared, as the case may be, the roofs of many other buildings. 

Zaf led him to the flattened summit of the dome and identified several of the surrounding banks and institutions by the names of their owners - Morgan and Morgan, Rothschild, 
International Financial Services Council, and so on, nearly doubling David's perception of local geography in five minutes.

"And this is Signe," he finished. They were not alone. A girl was sitting on a small rug. She was a Danish girl that David recognised from a desk near his own. She had raw 
features and dressed plainly, and obviously had some kind of crush on Zaf. There was a clear air of resentment at David's presence.

They relaxed in the sun, David feigning sleep whilst desperately trying to memorise all the new material, Zaf and Signe talking quietly; he, serious, she flirtatious. There were 
people resting and walking on other roofs.

The great river swept by on either side, forming a bow-wave from the upstream end of the island, and a long wake behind, as though New Frankfurt were actually afloat and heading 
for Switzerland.

David was surprised that walking around on the roof was permitted. It was exactly the sort of thing the authorities would normally forbid. Zaf later explained that it was officially 
forbidden, but that many Muslim employees had declared that they preferred to pray in the open air, and that the practice was therefore tolerated. After all, they couldn't do much 
harm other than fall from the edge onto someone important below.

There were catwalks joining most of the buildings together, and David started to walk on the roof every lunchtime, consolidating his knowledge of Island geography, but also 
because he enjoyed the fresh air. Signe was usually there, waiting for Zaf. They talked, and she clearly began to turn her attention to David, restricting the scope of his 
exploration. 

As a result, David took most of his walks in the late afternoon instead, when he was usually quite alone apart from the gathering flocks of little birds, starlings. In this way, he was 
able to document the entire island over a few weeks, taking care, however, never to write anything down until he was in his hotel.

He discovered the nuclear plant nestling under a false canopy like a chalet roof. The water and sewage works were accommodated under a light plastic dome. He reported both in 
his daily wastebasket. He identified the building that was entered from below only by security staff, a tall, dark grey, windowless column with many aerials and dishes on its 
summit. 

Next to the security building, he also observed a little square park about 50 metres a side, a lawn surrounded by monastic arched cloisters. He could see people moving around, 
but they stayed within the cloistered area. He noted its position, wondering how he could reach it from below.

He asked Zaf about the park. He  claimed to know nothing, but recommended asking Signe. Next time David encountered Signe on the dome, he mentioned the little park. To his 
surprise, Signe flushed pink and asked, "What have you heard?"

"Nothing. Zaf thought you might know."

She paused, turning away to face a procession of barges pushing upstream. She eventually replied, "It isn't a garden."

"Oh."

"There's no secret. It's a sort of prison. I'll take you, if you like."

"A prison?"

"Yes, if you do something serious enough, that's where they put you. You want to see?"

David's "Sure!" was tinged with dread.

"In that case, ask Mrs Chu for the key to the Garden of Correction this afternoon."

"Mrs Chu?"

"Yes. A friend of hers is there for a while. She holds the key for our section of the dealing room."

Mrs Chu stared at him impassively for a moment before picking up her Japanese puzzle box and opening it with nineteen practiced flicks. She handed him an access ring, 
speaking a phrase that seemed to contain the words "tomorrow morning". 


<p class=drop>Signe was carrying a shopping bag from Tesco gmbh when David met her in the hallway. The new ring permitted access to the mysterious door that only security men seemed to 
use. Beyond the metal door there was a small hallway, punctuated by a counter. The walls, floor and counter were in plastic faux marble, scratched and cracked. There was a 
smell of disinfectant. A big guard checked them for concealed weapons by patting them all over. Signe shuddered. A short, supervised walk brought them to another metal door, 
which opened into the cloisters David had seen from above.

He was greeted by a chorus of moans. Several emaciated men, wrapped in grey blankets, were clustered around the door. David followed Signe as she pushed through them. All 
the prisoners seemed to be crippled in some way. Signe ignored them all until she reached a figure hunched in a corner of the wall. The man was Chinese, thin and bony, and very 
obviously blind. Signe picked out a packet of dates from her shopping bag and gave it to him. She then turned and handed the bag to the tallest of the prisoners who had followed 
them.

"He can be relied upon to divide the food fairly."

David was still reeling with shock at the state of the prisoners, their haggard faces, the fact that they were all naked under their blankets, their emaciation, their disabilities - the 
missing hands and feet. He said: "What's going on here?"

"These people have all done something against the law in New Frankfurt, and the punishment varies with the crime. Tell David what you did, Lee."

Between nibbles of the sticky packet of compressed dates, Lee spoke quietly in English: "There were three of us. We were making a short sell cross-over ladder, you 
understand?"

David nodded, then, realising Lee's problem with non-verbal communication, "Yes." It was a complex way of making money by generating artificial falls in share price over a group 
of inter-dependent or competing companies. You could make a lot of money, but it was a technique from the fast lane, and crashes were frequent.

"They caught us, I have no idea how, it is a scam difficult to detect. It is almost legal."

"Yes, I know."

"Our man on the outside, the Davos contact, he disappeared. Maybe he betrayed us. My colleague on The Island, they beheaded him. I was lucky. They made me blind."

"Lucky?"

"Sure. They just seal the eyelids. Surgical procedure. It is reversible. There will be some small loss of vision, but I will see again. In a year and two months."

Signe added: "They just leave the prisoners out here. A blanket each. A little food every day, unlimited water. A latrine. They are allowed visitors. Of course, there are fights over 
food and blankets. The blind ones often miss out on food. The security guys do nothing at all about it. People die. And when the sentence is over, if the prisoner survives, they just 
expel them from New Frankfurt whatever condition they are in."

"I'd heard rumours," said David, "I always thought they were exaggerated."

"Well, not many dare to defy the administration here, and they always make sure the victim is discredited before release. The only reason I know about it is because Lee was a 
friend, and I've been bringing him food. They blind people, remove hands, feet, whatever. All surgically with anaesthetic, of course."

David recalled Elaine's carefully disabled hand and wondered what fate would await him, were he to be discovered. 

"Which one is Mrs Chu's friend?"

"That one." Signe indicated a young man with no feet who was creeping around the quadrangle on hands and knees, weeping.
 
He was glad when Signe decided to leave. She had spent most of the time in conversation with Lee, leaving David to contemplate the sorry creatures incarcerated here. A small 
struggle between two inmates was quickly broken up by the big man Signe had entrusted with her bag of provisions. Someone came up to them and spoke urgently but 
incomprehensibly. He evidently had no tongue. David spotted a number of figures with missing ears or noses. Several others lay unmoving as though already dead.

His wastebasket report that day contained a short description of the prison and conditions. Since starting this mission, he had, until now, given little thought to how it would end. 
He certainly didn't want to finish up in the cloisters. At the end of his report, he added that he had covered the whole of the ground he could reach, and asked, for the first time, 
whether it would be convenient for him to leave New Frankfurt now. Two days later, someone brushed past him in the hotel lobby, and he found himself holding a tiny screw of 
paper. He didn't open it until he was in the toilet. It said "dome 1640 today". At twenty to five, he was on the dome in a light drizzle, pretending to relish the fresh air. No-one else 
was in sight. A few birds were flitting around.

One of the birds landed rather untidily near him. He didn't look at it at first. Then it made a buzzing noise, and he turned. It might have passed as a bird at a distance, but it was 
rather bigger than one of the starlings, and didn't look at all natural close up. With due precaution, David edged towards the mechanism, which he now recognised as one of those 
military spy robots that were becoming very popular. He picked it up. It was very light in weight, the wings made of a brown translucent fabric, stiffened by plastic "bones". Its head 
was a sphere with two lenses in it, its legs and feet were flexible plastic. He could hear a voice, and he turned round guiltily, but no-one was there. He realised that the voice was 
coming from the bird. He held it close to his ear. "Can you hear me?" it said.

"Uh, yes," he replied, nearly dropping it in surprise.

"Are you OK?" It was Franz's voice.

David hesitated, "I suppose so, but I have just about finished the survey, and I can't see any way forward. I wondered if it would be all right for me to finish now."

"Finished? I don't think so. We only had communications from you three times. We were worried, but you kept returning to the hotel, seemingly without problem. The conclusion: 
you had had a fright, you wanted to avoid suspicion, and would resume when you considered it safe."

"What? I've reported every day."

"In that case, you are discovered. You must leave immediately."

"Will someone meet me? I still have a lot of this in my head, and I could still be useful."  But the bird was silent. David dropped it, and it fluttered into the air. He didn't bother to 
watch it. 

<p class=drop>David's flesh was creeping with apprehension as he climbed back through the skylight and descended to the dealing floor. He grabbed a few of his things, and fled to the 
Underground shuttle. Two security guards were waiting for him. Apprehension turned to terror and his legs would hardly support him. The security men virtually carried him down to 
an office in the basement and left him there. They didn't even lock the door, but David was paralysed with dread. He was trembling by the time someone came. The someone was 
a short, neatly dressed man of about forty; bald, clean-shaven, quick in his movements. "My name is Arthur. Come with me," he said.

His manner was so friendly and matter-of-fact that David began to feel better, worry less. Arthur walked briskly, David hurried to keep up. He said, "What is all this about?"

Arthur stopped and turned. The corridor was green, made greener by the low wattage panels. One of the panels was flickering. It gave a sinister cast to Arthur's face. "You know 
very well what this is about, David."

"Is it about me walking on the roof? Lots of people do it.  I thought it was OK."

Arthur glared at him for a moment, then wheeled around and strode on. They came to a large metal door which Arthur had to open with his opal. The room was filled with light. The 
light came from hundreds of video screens lining the walls and partitions. For each group of a dozen screens there was an operator. David was staring at the moving images on 
nearby screens. A group of people walking down a passageway, the camera swinging  from time to time and tracking them. A view of an escalator in a building David had never 
visited, the camera again tracking along. A desktop, nothing happening. The inside of a toilet with a distressing amount of detail. "Here," said Arthur, "Come here."

The scenes on this group of screens were all quite familiar. David's desk; the route David followed from Underground to office; views from the roof; Signe giving a bag to the prisoner 
in the cloisters; David's hotel; David's room; David's computer; David's little maps; David's wastebin. He could feel himself blushing, but he managed to ask, "Have you got the 
entire world bugged?"

"Not exactly. We have surveillance on all our citizens and workers." 

Of course. The opal rings. Looking at the videos, he could now see that they were all wide-angle shots with frequent close-ups of the ring wearer. The videos were converted, 
re-perspectived, balanced and smoothed to sanitise what would have seemed like the worst excesses of child moviemakers. "I see. The opals. Do I get representation at my trial?" 

"There is no trial. You are guilty. The record you see here proves it beyond doubt. We have many examples of you mapping New Frankfurt. This is forbidden. It is disloyal." 
Somehow, now that discovery was complete, David felt much calmer, resigned. He was trying not to think about the cloisters and the state of the incarcerated victims but ever 
since visiting them, he had been adjusting to the danger of spending jail time there. He was pretty sure he could tough out a year or two if they didn't cripple him too much.

"But you cannot possibly see everyone all the time. What made you suspect me?"

"We know all about Franz." David rocked with that revelation. Arthur continued, "He frequently identifies
discontents with a resentment towards the city. You were always under suspicion, but then everyone is."

"But he just warned me..."

"No. <i>We</i> just warned you to make you run in a predictable fashion. It saves so much time. You don't think a spy drone could make it through our air defence, even disguised as a 
bird, unless we permitted it? And here is the... physical proof, no?" Arthur produced a stack of paper. The pornographic images were crushed and smudged, stained with coffee, the contents of 
David's wastebasket for months.

"Whatever you suspect about me, it's a misunderstanding."

"I think not. Franz made it clear to you that you were working against New Frankfurt, and we have enough evidence if we needed it, which we don't, by the way. We do not have 
hours of video, we have weeks, months. Your guilt is certain. We have decrypted dozens of your little litterbin messages. But we do not need proof. It is sufficient that we, I, 
believe in your guilt. As you may know, we do not spend weeks in court for an open and shut case like yours."

There was something quite paralysing about the cold manner in which his fate was being sealed. Arrest, no trial, sentence to be carried out immediately, it appeared. He heard the 
sentence - beheading - but was somehow insulated from the horror by disbelief.

Some small part of him was relieved that the sentence was irreversible death, rather than years in the cloisters with some horrible disability. He stopped listening to Arthur's quiet 
voice, remembering, instead, the persistent story that victims of decapitation remained conscious for a while after their heads were severed. A French researcher, who had 
obtained permission to crouch by the guillotine to interrogate executed heads post mortem, had even reported several cases in which the deceased's eyes blinked and mouth 
moved in response to the investigator calling the head's previous owner by name. More recent scientific speculation argued that consciousness might remain for nearly half a 
minute.

But, even if these macabre stories were true, at least the suffering would be measured in seconds rather than months. Arthur interrupted David's morbid thoughts with: "The 
sentence will, of course, be carried out under anaesthetic, as is customary. We are not barbarians."

"Yes, you are," snapped David.

"Our laws and punishments are widely known. To avoid the punishments, you must simply obey the laws. Have you anything to say in your defence? Circumstances may be 
taken into account."

"You injured my girlfriend's hand. She was one of the protesters last year."

"Motive: revenge, then? But I'm afraid that doesn't count. She was also breaking the law. This city-state must have strict laws. The money we are trusted to manage for the rest of 
the world demands strict rules. The punishments are severe, but traditional, and carried out without unusual cruelty, the mutilations, in particular, under scrupulous medical 
procedure and supervision." Arthur paused and raised an eyebrow. "Now, if there's nothing else you wanted to tell me, we might as well get on with it. It is thoughtless to make the 
convicted person brood unnecessarily over their sentence."

David succumbed to the march to the hospital, accompanied by Arthur. If he had ever had any urge to resistance, all fight and flight were squeezed out of him now by Arthur's 
matter-of-fact delivery of judgement.. too late... too late. He was carefully dressed in a hospital gown and loaded on a trolley. A rather jolly man in a white coat, who introduced 
himself as David's anaesthetist, assured him that they would take good care of him and asked whether he was allergic to anything. As if it really mattered. 

Just before they passed through the doors of pre-med, Arthur nodded politely to him, saying, "See you later." David was confused. Arthur was not the type to confuse "Goodbye 
for ever" with "See you later". So he said "Goodbye" to himself as the doors closed behind him, but when the jolly anaesthetist delivered a transdermal shot of something very 
strong, while inviting him to count down from 99, David began to wonder if this was just an elaborate mock execution to frighten him.

<p class=drop>It was, and it wasn't. And then again it was. David's first conscious sensation after the transdermal was a tingling pain all over his body, resembling the torture of returning 
circulation after an extremity has been chilled to a sub-zero temperature. He opened his eyes. Either he was in total darkness, or he was blind. He tried to move, to turn his head, 
which he apparently still possessed. Nothing. Then the light went on, and Arthur appeared. "You're awake, I see. No. Don't try to talk. You won't be able to." David was, so far, 
impressed at being able to see and hear. But the pain was still there.

Arthur moved to the side, out of David's view. He said, "That's what you look like now." On the opposite wall, David saw a projectograph. At first he couldn't figure it out. Then he 
realised he was looking at his own head in profile, clamped in a metal framework, but where his neck should have been, there was just a small forest of tubes and wires. Below 
that, nothing. Arthur was speaking again. "I forgot to mention that your sentence is six months. The longest anyone has survived, however, even with this life support, is 49 days. 
But we keep refining our technique. Perhaps you will serve your full sentence, and the surgeons can have an attempt at re-attaching you to your body, which, I am afraid, will not 
be much use to you by then, though there will be a certain interest in doing the whole re-grafting process. You will find that you begin to lose functions as time passes. First 
vision, then hearing. Mercifully, I think, most prisoners achieve a sort of Alzheimer's state within a few weeks."

David only had one visitor, as far as he could tell. By then, he could neither see or hear, but he could tell by the smell of her breath that it was Mrs Chu, and he was pleased.

[*BLURB] Something of an excuse for an editorial.

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>This issue has been rather difficult to get out, due to lack of manpower in the editorial department.
However, I resolved to get it out in April, and get it out I did. Just.

Since Mythaxis began, I have been astonished at the quantity of talented stories I've been offered. We already
have enough raw material for the next issue, but I am always delighted to receive unsolicited stories, so
I can make the magazine as wide-ranging as possible.

Another little gem of a cartoon from Liam Baldwin.

If I drivel on any longer, it'll be May, and I'll have missed my deadline, so enjoy. See you again in June.
