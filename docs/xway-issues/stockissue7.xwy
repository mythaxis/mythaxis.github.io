[*BLURB] Sometimes, people push their luck, don't they? 
 

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>The bus hurtled though the wet Glasgow streets; every
change
of direction, however slight, caused the passengers to be thrown around
in the tight
three-sided cells of seat backs and windows.

Xavier Rothschild the Third
sat, trying to filter his senses, to block everything out and reach that
elusive state of peace.  Retirement suited him but the city did not.  In
the good weather he walked.  When it rained... well, when it rained he
had the bus. 

<div class=pullquote>a voice that screamed against nature, a
sensation like chewing tinfoil</div>The couple sitting diagonally ahead with the toddler who
wouldn't sit down were testing his calm.  They were arguing and letting
their foul spawn run rampant in the aisle.  Rothschild fought back the
temptation to stick his foot out and send the child sprawling. The
troublesome toddler stopped, wiped a runny nose on his arm and turned to
face him.   

'What are you looking at?' he snarled at the boy.  

The child
stood in the aisle looking up at him, eyes wide, tears forming.
Rothschild felt only a moment of regret but that broke when the
expression on the boy's face suddenly changed. His expression became
slack, the colour draining from his previously ruddy complexion.

'Rothschild,' said the child in a voice that screamed against nature, a
sensation like chewing tinfoil.  'I come!' 

'What the hell?' said Rothschild as
the child shook his head, his colour returning and the rampage resuming.
He looked around, trying to gauge the reactions of the others on the
bus.  No-one else seemed to have noticed the child's behaviour. A
challenge?  From whom?  This was something he hadn't seen in a long
time.  He was so old and tired, and long out of practice. 

'Rothschild,'
came a voice from behind.  He looked around, to a tracksuit-clad
woman
of indeterminate age, two rows back.  Her eyes were glassy and her jaw
slack.  'I come for you...' 

'Rothschild', echoed an old man, standing at
the front of the bus. 

'Rothschild,' chorused the middle-class couple, two rows
back and on the right.

'Rothschild,' cried the teenager in
the baseball
cap, the music from his earphones clearly heard all the way from the
back of the bus. 

'Rothschild!'  An atonal sound, the whole bus now in
unison. 

'Rothschild!'  The bus driver leaning out his cabin, part of the
chorus, the bus careering across the lanes. 

'Enough!' he bellowed,
slamming his fist on the window beside him. 

<p class=drop>He looked up, suddenly
aware of the silence.  There was no unholy chorus, there were no otherworldly
blank expressions.  Just a few of his fellow travellers giving him
a sideways look before going back to their business.  Not even the
arguing couple spared him a moment's glance. He got up and made his way
to
the front of the bus, ringing the bell to get off. The bus came to a
halt in
its own good time and he stumbled off, breathing a sign of relief.

'Hello, Rothschild,' said a now-familiar voice. He didn't turn, but he
saw a figure out of the corner of his eye.  The bus moved off, the
grumble
of the engine gradually replaced by the steady roar of the rain. 

'Do I
know you?' he asked casually, fumbling about his pockets for a smoke.  

'No, I don't think you do,' said the other man.  'I'm long after your
time.' 

'Hmm, yes,' Rothschild mused, placing a dog-eared roll-up between
his lips and waiting for a moment, eventually frowning. 

'A problem?'
said
the other, smiling broadly. 

'A trifle,' Rothschild replied, 'a simple
trick, one of the very first.' 

'And you can't do it?' 

'It doesn't look
like it.'  Rothschild removed the cigarette and looked hard at the end.
'Odd, it was such a simple trick.'  

He glanced over to the other man, who
wore a sharper style than his personal, more lived-in look. 

'I know your
name... Xavier Rothschild the Third,' said the sharply-dressed man, 'And
now
I know your number.' 

'Ah,' said Rothschild simply. 

'And I have come for
you.' 

Rothschild noticed the sky darkening to black and his surroundings, the
shelter, the road and passing traffic, all fading to grey. 'Impressive,'
he said quietly.  'Planeshifting.  Somewhere to leave my remains,
I suppose?' 

The sharply-dressed man just nodded in response.

'Any chance
you could furnish me with your name?  In whatever realm I end up
spending eternity, it would be good to know who has seen me off.' 

'Of
course,' said the sharply-dressed man, his ego apparently flattered.
'Lucien Bargo.' 

'Lucien Bargo?'  Rothschild nodded his acceptance.  'I
thank you, Mr Bargo.' 

'You're very welcome,' replied Bargo, 'And if you
don't mind...'  He threw his arms out in a theatrical pose and a
pillar of fire erupted around Rothschild, who stood,
unflinching, while the inferno raged around him. Bargo gestured simply
and the fire ceased.  Confusion etched his brow. 

Rothschild drew from
the now-lit cigarette.  He exhaled deeply before finally turning to face
the other. 'The simplest of mistakes.'  He looked down at the cigarette
held between his fingers.  'You do not know my name or my number.  You
have no power over me.'  He paused, smiling a devilish smile. 'But I
know your name, Lucien Bargo, and now I know your number.' 

Casually he
flicked his cigarette at Bargo and as it brushed his sleeve Bargo
was engulfed in an identical blaze.  Within seconds, Lucien Bargo had
been
reduced to ash, his scream lost to the wind. Rothschild stood for a
moment,
flexing muscles he had not used for many years as the world around him
returned to normal.  It felt good. 

<p class=drop>The man who called himself Rothschild
looked up as the rain started to ease, holes in the cloud layer letting
some much-needed sun through. 'This might turn out to be a good day
after all.'

[*ITEM] The Door with no Key

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] A Tale of Eastern Promise.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>Jez couldn't get his head around it. We
were lingering over a couple of pints of some yuppy ale or other in The 
Peasant's Revolt (apostrophe in the wrong place on
the new inn sign), a pub in a warren of London streets, and
he said to me: "Can't get me 'ead around it, mate."

"Around what, Jeremy?"

"All that stuff wot's 'appening these days. Them djinns, like. An' them
magicians and that flyin' carpet caper. Why don' they use a 'elicopter
like anyone else, eh?"

"You yourself don't use a helicopter a great deal, though, Jez, do you?"

 
<div class=tinyquote>There was the Door to which I found no Key;<hr>
There was the Veil through which I might not see:<hr>
Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee<hr>
There was--and then no more of Thee and Me.</div>
"Not as such, mate. Not as such. Point taken. But I ain't flittin' about
over folks' 'eads on a ruddy doormat, either. It's takin' the bread out
of the mouths of taxi drivers, innit? Not that I 'ave a lotta time for
them robbin' bastids, either. Can't get in an' out of a cab these days
for less'n a tenner, even if it don't move more'n a 'undred yards. Come
to think of it, I wouldn't mind one of them flyin' rugs, matter of fact.
Not that you could get more'n one passenger on most of 'em, an' they're
'opeless for any sorta luggage, really, ain't they?. They're not really
load-bearin', kind of thing. You wouldn't want to try shiftin', like, a
washin' machine on one, would ya? But I'd think they'd be attractive to
wimmin, though, eh? Comfy, too."

Jez could go in this fashion for hours, so I said: "What's your point,
Jeremy?"

"My point is, ya see, my point is.... I dunno whether t'ask for one."

"Ask who?"

"The genie, o'course, mate. If I should 'appen to do, like, a favour to
one a them genies or djinns or wottever they're called, an' 'e should
give me, you know, three wishes, as they do..."

"As they allegedly do, yes..."

"Whether, in that case, I oughta ask for one o' them magic carpets as
well as, o'course, fantastic riches an' eternal life, an' that. It's
like winnin' the lottery wivout 'avin' to go down Tesco's and buy a
ruddy ticket."

"It's not at all like winning the lottery, Jez. These genies are tricky,
you know. You could find yourself spending your eternal life inside a
huge gold ingot like that poor bugger in Eastbourne."

"Ah, well, ya see. That's where I got ya, like. See the old Shoreditch
telephone exchange, right?"

"No."

"Big ruddy building up Shoreditch?"

"Still no."

"Doesn' matter, mate. 'Uge massive ruddy buildin' they closed down when
they found out the place was totally empty. Arfur says..."

"Arthur?"

"Yeah, Arfur, the wife's  bruvver-in-lawr, right? Well, 'e says British 
Telecom
moved the 'ole phone exchange into a computer the size of a biscuit box down
Leaden'all in 1981. Arfur lost 'is night watchman job when they shut the
doors last Easter. Only they've broke it up into like offices now an' 'e's got 'is job
back."

"Where is this going, Jeremy?"

"I'm tellin' ya, ain't I? There's this Ay-rab lawyer got a office in
there now what'll write you up a forum of words..."

"Form of words?"

"That's wot I said, innit? A forum of words wiv all the right stuff in
it, namin' Allah an' the prophets an' powers that be an' everyfink.
Completely bullet-proof, mate, only it's, like, customized to wottever
ya want, so the djinns can't take you for a ride."

"And this 'Ay-rab lawyer' charges how much?"

"'Undred quid. Flat rate for three wishes."

"So <i>he</i> takes you for a ride, instead of the djinn. Why don't you
offer this lawyer a cut of the enormous riches when you get them,
instead of paying  the flat rate now?"

"Are you nuts? That could get seriously expensive, mate. No, I'll take
the flat rate now. But I gotta decide wot I want, see."

"Hmm... How about the eternally balanced bank account?"

"Wot's that?"

"Well, you ask for a Swiss bank account that stays balanced at, say, a
million pounds, no matter how much you spend. It works well for tax,
too. It's not as noticeable as all that gold and jewels and stuff that
these djinns usually hand out, and you don't have to worry about burglars
like you would with a cellar full of bling."

"Cool."

"And then you've got to be clear that your eternal life takes place in
good health, you don't age too much, and there's a termination clause in
case, after a few hundred years, you get tired of life."

"Never thoughta that. Cool, yeah."

I drained my pint and stood up. "Anyway, Jez, I've got to get back to
work. Let me know how you make out, and remember me when you're stinking
rich."

"Yeah, sure, mate. Course I will."

I knew Jeremy was seriously deluded in hoping to find a supernatural
benefactor, but he was right that it was difficult to keep track of all
the new developments, as the world of the Arabian Nights began to invade
normal life. London appeared to be the epicentre of the most vigorous
activity. The flying carpets problem was the very least of it, with the
government trying to levy a tax on them, and the Civil Aviation
Authority and Air Traffic Control trying to make sure they didn't pose a
hazard to aircraft.

<div class=tinyquote>When You and I behind the Veil are past,<hr>
Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last,<hr>
Which of our Coming and Departure heeds<hr>
As the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast.</div>
Then there was the Magnetic Mountain that had appeared in the Thames
Estuary. Anything iron that went closer than half a mile to the huge
black rock was drawn in and stuck to it. No amount of tugging would pull
a stricken ship away. Even wooden boats tend to have metal nails holding
them together, and most boats of any kind have an engine. A few
adventurers succeeded in rowing ashore in rubber dinghies, but one man
was fastened to a rock by his wrist watch until his companions managed
to extract him. And another, who had a cardiac pacemaker, died in a
distressingly gory fashion reminiscent of the movie Alien when his
pacemaker decided to attach itself to the rock. Ensuring that every
vessel gave the Magnetic Mountain a good mile of clearance had become a
difficult task for Trinity House, especially since it had proved 
impractical to mount a lighthouse on the rock.

But there were novelties to enjoy. In my work at the British Museum, we
had already had the opportunity to analyse a number of simple but
interesting "Arabian Nights" artifacts, including a jewelled dagger so
apparently old that carbon dating of its wooden haft estimated its age
at eight thousand years, and what at first had appeared to be a doll of
solid gold, but was now suspected, due to the discovery of a structure
of fossilised bones and organs below the metal skin, to be a miniaturised
gold-plated person. 

<p class=drop>As I returned from my rather extended lunch hour with Jez, Dr Halifax
was waiting for me with another treasure for our collection. Halifax was
temporarily in charge of the Middle Eastern section of the museum ever
since Professor Barnsley had recklessly fallen out with a magic carpet
salesman and been turned into an ape for one lunar month. Flying carpets
were expensive. The professor had wanted one for the museum's
collection, and he had attempted to get one on the cheap by theatening
the vendor with a Trading Standards investigation. He could still
communicate with his staff in writing - he had an elegant hand with a
fountain pen, even as a simian - but it was felt that his current image
lacked <I>gravitas</I>.

Halifax was good on his subject, but fussy and bossy in manner. However,
he had no direct authority over me. I was in Technical section, he was
in a sub-section of Exhibits, but he was plainly impatient for me to
look at this new trinket. It was a jewelled egg, apparently in ivory,
precious metals and gems, and rather reminiscent of the famous
Faberg&eacute; eggs. It was large - about the size of a rugby ball or
American football, but clearly egg-shaped, one end bulging more than the
other.

"Hmm... Where did this come from?"

"The RSPCA brought it in."

"Where did <I>they</I> get it?"

"Well, that was interesting." Halifax warmed to the subject. He plainly
had a tale to tell. "You remember that Googletube video everyone was
watching last week."

"Uuuh..." I hesitated. I hardly wanted to reveal that I'd been as amused
as everyone else at the disgraceful behaviour of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer with the thirteen houris, the swan and the donkey.

"You know... the roc!"

"Oh, yes. <I>That</I> video." A roc had taken up residence on the roof
of a block of council flats in Clapham. It more closely resembled a
pterodactyl than the huge eagle of legend. Its cries were like a
foghorn. In flight, it had about the same wingspan as a single-engined
Cessna aircraft, and it was wonderful to see. It seemed wary of humans,
but had no hesitation in preying on smaller animals and birds. No-one
walked their dog on Clapham Common any more, cats crept around, but only
after nightfall, and pigeons were a rare sight in the vicinity.

Two local youths had hatched a plan to become famous on Googletube. One
wrapped himself in his granny's fake fur coat and capered about on all
fours in view of the roc, while the other videoed the scene on his cell
phone.

The roc had, predictably, swooped on the dog impersonator, but, finding
him too heavy to lift, had gripped the screaming boy with its talons and
torn off the kid's left arm with its toothed "beak". The victim's
colleague had, in the tradition of wild life movie makers, continued to
film until the roc returned to its nest. The resulting shock video had
been a nine-day wonder. The injured boy's life was saved by paramedics,
but he was still in intensive care.

"Ah, yes. The roc. How did the RSPCA get hold of this?" I enquired.

"They were persuaded to try and capture the creature as if it was a
stray cat. They sent up a team, but the roc flew off, leaving this
behind in the nest."

"It can't be a roc's egg, surely. It's clearly manufactured."

"True," agreed Halifax, "But there's something inside, and we don't want
to break the egg to find out what."

"X-ray."

"Quite."

"OK. Let's go." I unlocked the lab and cleared some small articles from
the X-ray table.

We viewed the egg from all sides under X-rays. Whatever was inside the
egg was almost transparent to the beam. It was shapeless and hard to
see. What did show up, however, was an intricate mechanism below the
skin of the egg - interlocking cog wheels, screws, hinges, springs and
levers connected to the jewel settings and metal decorations on the
egg's surface.

"Yes," remarked Halifax, "We twiddled some of these jewels around, but
it didn't seem to do anything."

"It looks to me like an intricate puzzle," I said. "Just up my street.
Let me work on it for a while."

"Well..." Halifax was clearly reluctant to surrender his treasure.

"Come on. I'm your best hope. It won't leave the premises, I promise.
I'll call you when and if I get it open."

"You've got twenty-four hours, and do <i>not</i> break it."

"Oh, give me a break. This isn't some detective movie. It's Thursday
now. I'll get back to you by Monday. OK?"

"OK. But, after that, I'm taking it to St. Thomas's Hospital for an MRI
scan."

I suppressed a grin. With all that metal in the mechanism, an MRI scan
would be meaningless. But I'd tell him that on Monday.

As soon as Halifax had gone, I phoned Jeremy on his mobile. "Jeremy,
mate, have you got a phone number for that Arab lawyer?"

<p class=drop>Khalid Emir was not at all what I expected. No robed oriental, he. From
his polished shoes to his polished hair, via his immaculate shiny suit
and gleaming white shirt, he looked more like a fangless Dracula than
the Sheikh of Araby.

He was exceptionally polite, meticulous in his questions, and produced
my Form of Words on a desktop computer. Inexhaustible Swiss Bank
Account, Eternal Youth With Termination Option, Enhanced Charisma. One
hundred pounds including VAT. American Express, apparently, was his
chosen payment method.

"Beware, sir," he added, "Not all demons are duly grateful for their
freedom. Nevertheless, a djinn may not act against you if you give him
no cause, so, above all, address him with courtesy and offer him no
violence, whatever threats he may utter, and utter them he will."

I thanked him, and he reminded me that we are all subject to the will of
Allah, and that our fates are written in advance. 

I did not tell him about the egg.

<div class=tinyquote>The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord<hr>

Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.</div>
It had been clear on the X-rays that the egg was a finely crafted box
with a combination lock. Arabian Nights lore strongly hinted at its true
purpose. I took precautions; I took more X-rays; I took my time.
Twenty-eight of the jewel settings were free to turn. Each jewel could
be turned to one of twenty-eight positions. To solve the combination by
trial and error would take much longer than the age of the planet. To
further complicate solution, part of the intricate mechanism was devoted
to making misleading random clicks and movements of the metal
decorations when the jewels were rotated. With the X-rays, however, I
could see exactly where to turn each jewel to open the egg. So that is
what I did. It was not particularly simple. Even with the X-ray images,
the function of each tiny wheel and lever was often obscure.

After twenty-two hours, I turned the last jewel into position, holding
my breath. The egg gave a satisfying clunk, and split along an irregular
line around the circumference. I reached for Khalid's Form of Words. A
wisp of dense pink smoke issued from the crack, and rotated gently into
a column reaching to the ceiling. The column thickened and grew more
substantial. I had expected the apparition to form almost
intantaneously, but it took nearly five minutes for the smoke to
coalesce into a humanoid figure some twelve feet in height. The djinn
was in the form of a muscular, rugged man, in white robes and holding a
scimitar, rather like a bearded Arnold Schwartzeneger dressed in a toga. Even with
the museum's generous ceiling height, the djinn had to sit on the floor
to avoid scraping his cranium on the decorative plaster mouldings.

I began to hear words in my mind; words which I hadn't heard in my ears.
The genie was talking to me. The lip-sync was awful, like one of these
dubbed martial arts movies, and, though the words were English words,
they didn't make a lot of sense, and were reminiscent of a Babelfish
translation. Gradually, the words became less random.

"FEAR NOT SENSE" 

OK. 'feel no fear', I supposed. I started to read from Khalid's Form of
Words: "In the name of..."

"VOCALISATION CEASE"

I continued to read out my modest requests.

"VOCALISATION CEASE!", a thunderous command. Taking the hint, I ceased
vocalising.

Khalid had told me to expect some resistance or prevarication, in the
event that I encountered a djinn and demanded favours. I suspected,
though, that this was more of a language problem. I hadn't expected
that.

The djinn glared at me for a long moment, then he spoke in my head: "OK.
Now you understand. Yes?"

"I understand. What about my three wishes?"

"There <I><b>are</b></I> no wishes at this time."

"But I released you from that egg."

"I entered the egg willingly, and could have opened it from within by
myself. Indeed, I have often spent time outside the egg. A hundred years
is a long time to spend compressed into such a small container." It was
strange to sense these words so clearly from the genie's unsynchronised lips, but I was
getting used to it.

"Why, then, were you inside the egg?"

"I was waiting for <I><b>you</b></I>."

"Me?"

"Not for you in person, but I was seeking  someone capable of solving
the problem of the egg. Which you have done."

"Please explain."

<div class=tinyquote>Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<hr> One
thing at least is certain--This Life flies;<hr> One thing is certain and
the rest is Lies;<hr> The Flower that once has blown for ever
dies.</div> It was a long and rambling tale of journeys, jealousy,
anger, revenge, magic, punishment, ambition, sorrow and so on. Allah,
apparently, had ordained that no mercy be given or received. Some of it
sounded quite familiar to any scholar of The Arabian Nights. What
it amounted to was that our djinn here - let's call him Grafmeer, his
true name is a secret, apparently - had a long-standing feud with a
fellow djinn - Halimoss, another alias - in which Halimoss imprisoned Grafmeer's child
in an obsidian block. However, in his haste, Halimoss had failed to
remember the mechanism for the release of Grafmeer's son. So, though
Grafmeer eventually prevailed over Halimoss and enslaved him, neither
Halimoss, nor Grafmeer, nor anyone else, had yet mastered the trick of
opening the block. For hundreds of years, Grafmeer had been searching
for a sage who could solve the problem of the obsidian prison, without
success. The whole Arabian Nights' invasion of London, culminating in
the puzzle egg, was Grafmeer's desperate quest for a problem-solver. And
I was elected.

Grafmeer did not seem the type of entity who would take "No" for an answer.

"OK, Grafmeer. Bring it on."

"That is not possible. You must come with me." So saying, he scooped me
up in one muscular arm, and we ascended - the only possible word,
"ascended" - through the fabric of the museum as if the entire edifice
were made of mist. The journey to Mesopotamia took only a few minutes.
Despite the speed, there was no sensation of rushing air. I think I
occupied the entire time with one continuous scream of terror. 

<p class=drop>Imagine a bowl of blue sky, out of which an impossibly brilliant sun
beat down on an infinite plain of grey dust sprinkled with pale stones.
I staggered under the impact of all those merciless photons as though
struck with a blunt instrument. I was persiring audibly within seconds. 

"Behind you." said Grafmeer.

I turned to see a black, shiny box, like an enormous dice (Yes, I know
the singular of dice is 'die', but I can never use the word in earnest) with faces
about ten feet square, floating  serenely some four feet from the rocky
ground. I quickly moved into its shade. Grafmeer, an even taller
presence now that there was room to stand up, was touching the black
cube in various places. Each time he pressed it, a pattern of white
squiggles temporarily appeared on the surface of the whole face, and one
section of the pattern would slide along, to be replaced by a new
pattern. I quickly realised that the squiggles were Arabic text, broken
up and turned sideways or upside down.

"It's writing!" I said.

"It amused Halimoss, may his spirit be reborn in a pig, to inscribe
a poem on each face of the cube so that, when all the poems were
correctly arranged, the cube would open. Then he scrambled the pattern
beyond repair, with my son inside."

I touched one face of the cube, and the writing flared up for a few
seconds as a section slid away and was replaced before fading again.

Grafmeer started in alarm: "Don't confuse it further! I shall make the
moves when you solve the problem. All the parts of all the poems are
always present on the surface of the object, but, unless each face of
the block contains a complete poem, it will not release my son."

I do not read Arabic, but I can tell when it is written upside down, or
sideways, or, as was most frequently found, truncated by one of the
invisible seams along which the pattern slid. It was just a symbol
jumble.

At first sight, it appeared hopeless, but it was worth a try, especially
if rewards were forthcoming.

I said: "I need to go back."

"Why? The box is here."

"I need my camera from the office."

"Camera? Is this the plural of 'camel' in your language?" asked Grafmeer.

I explained what the camera looked like and where it was.

"I will collect it. To carry you back and forth is most exhausting. Wait
here."

While I was saying: "Where would I go?", Grafmeer disappeared with a
whoosh of displaced air, leaving me sweating for England.

I realised this problem he wanted me  to solve was likely to be
insoluble, but even if I couldn't do it, I thought I'd be all right if I
just played along with him. Right now, he needed me, or he thought he
did, and I ought to keep it that way. If I admitted defeat immediately,
he might just leave me here in this arid wilderness in which I'd be
lucky to survive a day.

A solitary bird circled, black against the dome of the sky. For a
moment, I imagined it was a vulture, anticipating my imminent demise.
Then I realised that, in this fairytale dimension, it was more likely
to be a roc, which wouldn't bother to wait for its prey to expire before
dining.

<div class=tinyquote>Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who<hr>

Just when I feared Grafmeer was never coming back - after thirty seconds
or so - I heard the rush of his arrival, and he reappeared, holding the
camera between massive finger and gargantuan thumb. I took multiple
photographs of the faces and of the vertices of the block showing the
relationship of the faces to each other. The job was difficult, because
the inscriptions on a given face only remained visible for a short time,
and, on one occasion, Grafmeer changed the configuration by mistake, and
we had to start again. I had to lie on my back to photograph the lower
parts, and Grafmeer hoisted me like a cherry picker for the aerial
views. Eventually, I was satisfied that I had enough data to describe
the puzzle, even if I didn't have the solution yet.

"Take me back now, please." I asked.

"No!" he thundered, "You must open it now!"

I was scorched, soaked with perspiration, aching from the effort of
getting every image I needed, and mentally at the end of whatever tether
I had started the day with. "Listen! You've been working on this for
centuries, you tell me. Give me a break! It may take me weeks to figure
out. And one thing's for sure, I won't manage it out here. I will need
my computer. Take me back!"

"I will bring your computer!"

"Oh, yes, and there's a thirteen amp socket and a broadband connection
out here, is there?"

Grafmeer knitted his substantial brow and rumbled: "Beware, mortal. Do
not attempt to trick me. I may turn you into a marble statue of
yourself."

"If I'm out here much longer, I shall turn into a strip of dried meat
without your assistance."

Grafmeer was obviously accustomed to getting his way with people, but he
seemed to accept that he was not getting his son back here and now.
Another nightmarish flight brought us back to the museum.

"You have one day to find the solution," rumbled Grafmeer.

"Not enough. This is complicated. I need at least two weeks." At the
time, I feared there might be no solution at all, but a fortnight would
give me the chance to escape somewhere. On reflection, I later realised
that there was no escape from such as Grafmeer, so it was either solve
the problem, or perish in some fiendish Eastern fashion.

"I will wait!" pronounced Grafmeer.

"Not in here, please. There isn't room."

"It is a little uncomfortable," he conceded. "I shall disembody for a
while." So saying, he gradually sublimated into a pale pink smoke, and directed
himself into the empty milk bottle most commonly used to contain water
for use in soldering and to irrigate the weary plants on the window sill
when someone remembered to do so. The bottle glowed dimly.

<div class=tinyquote>But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays<hr>
Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;<hr>
Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,<hr>
And one by one back in the Closet lays.</div>
I set about the tedious task of sorting out which bits of poem belonged
on which face of the obsidian block. I was lucky. In order not to give
the game away, I posted a few fragments of my photographs on a
university Arabic forum, and was quickly rewarded with the information
that they were from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. I was given a pointer
to a website that had many stanzas in Arabic and in Fitzgerald's English
translation, which I must say is a rather flowery rendering of the
original. With a bit of effort, I was able to identify among the hundred
and one verses the six stanzas represented on the six faces of the cube.
After that, it was dead easy.

<p class=drop>"Yeah, right," said Jez. "It's all a bit obvious ter you, innit? But I
can't get me 'ead around 'ow ya solved it so quick when he'd been
workin' on it for years."

I sipped my vodka martini, paid for with a credit card whose balance was
perpetually paid off from my seemingly inexhaustible Swiss bank account.

"Well," I replied, "when I'd colour-coded all the bits of the poems, it
was obvious it was just a four by four Rubik's cube."

"A wot?"

"Rubik's cube. A sort of puzzle I was given when I was a kid. Normally
they were three by three, but you can get more complicated ones, like
four by four. I could never solve mine."

"So if you couldn't solve a smaller one, 'ow did ya solve this one?"

"The internet, of course. I ordered a four by four cube from an online
toy shop, got it next day, re-labelled the individual faces in the same
way as the photos of the real cube, then used a solution off the web to
solve it, and delivered the moves to Grafmeer. "

Jez had glazed over by the time I'd finished. "Wottever," he remarked,
and sniffed.
The enhanced charisma that Grafmeer had conferred upon me didn't
seem to work with Jez.

He drained his pint, shouted "Gotta go!" to the few of us littered in
the bar like flotsam left by a high tide, and rode his flying carpet
towards the double doors in a surfer's crouch. The carpet was a small
gift from me for pointing me at Khalid's Form of Words, which worked a
treat, by the way.

"Oi!" shouted the barman, "No bloody magic carpets in 'ere! You carry it
outside on the street and use it there!"

"Piss off, Terry," replied Jez, bumping open the doors with his
shoulder, and leaving. 

"Where was that bugger educated?" grumbled Terry, "London College of
Lightning Repartee?"

I discovered that, despite being rich, effectively immortal and oozing
charisma, I could still grin at Terry's tired joke.

[*ITEM] The Price of Youth

[*AUTHOR] Moon Bhatt

[*BLURB] Blood flows like time, from youth into old age

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>The Doctor looks old but he is barely a fifth of my age. He smiles at me
as if we are friends but I know that beneath that smile he is cursing me
for my youth. He is a new doctor, new to me. The last time I was here, no
more than two weeks ago, Dr Mjocha, an old friend, had looked so pale
and grey. I guess the job had got too much for him and he had been
forced to retire. Either that or the other thing. Hopefully, he retired.
I remove my coat and one of the nurses takes it. Although she isn't new,
I know because I recognise her cold blue eyes, her sharp intake of breath and the
nauseous look on her face tell me she hasn't been here long enough to
get used to the sight of my twin. I settle down onto the bed and let the
nurses run through their preparations, inserting tubes, clipping on
electrodes, and fitting an oxygen mask. 

Then the incision comes; a cold
silver scalpel, the sharp knife of surgery caressing me once again. The
conjoining artery is cut and my end is quickly clamped. I can instantly
feel the loss of my twin. I close my eyes and say a small prayer. I
never watch this part, the body being taken away to be disposed of, it's
not something I like to think about. I savour the moment. It never lasts
long enough, but for a fleeting minute I am happy. I am free, again. The
feeling of peace overwhelms me, the silence calms my mind and lets me
think once again. Am I a monster? How many lives will I sacrifice? I'm
an individual, one man, with one mind and, more importantly, one heart.
The joy quickly ebbs, like a tide that turns, like a wave that crashes in
and hangs high on the shore for just a moment until gravity sucks it
back into the sea. I can feel myself aging, I can feel time like a wind
rushing through me, pulling down every cell, like leaves dying and
falling from the branches of my tree. My skin is almost visibly sagging,
becoming heavier with every breath. I feel more like a monster now than
ever, an aging portrait of Dorian Grey, old and gnarled beyond my
youthful looks. 

<div class=pullquote>I'm whiter than the sands of Taiwan, colder than the icy plumes of
Enceladus, but I can still move like a fiery teenager</div>My peace is soon shattered when they bring the next twin. These 
blessed moments of peace are getting shorter every time. It
seems as though I'm back here in the hospital more frequently with every
visit. Soon, I won't be leaving at all. I'll just lie on the cold metal
bed and let the doctors bring me ever more fleeting moments of peace.
This one is crying already and the sound is higher and sharper than
before. One of the side effects of de-aging is an over-sensitivity of
hearing. It seems I am suddenly inside the mouth of the child, hearing
the scream from within my own head, and it isn't even close to me yet. I
can't stand the wailing, it penetrates me and gnaws at my bones. If
there was one adage from older times which I would happily adopt it is
that children should be seen and not heard, although in my case the
child shouldn't be seen either. Maybe children just shouldn't be. Then I
wouldn't even have the option, I would have passed into the gray mist a
long time ago. 

Another moment of peace ensues when they anaesthetise the infant,
preparing it for surgery. I don't like to know the sex, although I'm
always telling myself it's a boy. I don't want to hurt little baby
girls, I'm not that much of a monster. Am I? I know that the sex isn't
important, that either way it'll last a week or two, maybe even less if
my theory on diminishing returns is accurate. The nurses always have
that same apologetic look on their faces when they treat the baby. They
look as though they are sorry. What are they sorry for? I'm the monster! They
are just doing their job. Agreed, it might not be a glamorous job, it
might feel as if they are helping to exterminate unwanted children, but they
get paid for it; they are putting food on the table for their own
children. They and their kin are still surviving. They never give me
apologetic looks,
no, the looks of scorn are all saved up for me and focused
into small blasts of toxic glances. Some people think they know it all.
Well I've been alive long enough to know that you don't get anything for
nothing; there's no such thing as a free lunch, we all pay the same price
in the end. Even if we stave it off for a year or a decade or, in my
case, a century or two. 

My name is Peter Petual. I am 245 years old and
still going strong. Last week I played my
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson, or maybe it was his
son, I don't remember. Anyway, I played one of my descendants at
squash and won. I always win. They think they can beat me because I look
old. I'm whiter than the sands of Taiwan, colder than the icy plumes of
Enceladus, but I can still move like a fiery teenager. It's the
knowledge that lets me win; I've seen every trick in the book, every
feint and play. I know what move they are going to learn next before they
even realise their current skills won't work on me. I'm a champion, and
I'll be playing for many more years. Sometimes, they accuse me of
cheating. They say that technically I should be playing two of them, playing
doubles, but it's usually an ill-conceived joke. 

At last, they
join the baby's artery to mine and, in that moment - the moment the
newborn's blood runs fresh into my old veins - joy pulsates through my
tired body. I can feel the years that I've picked up in the few minutes
I've been living on my own fall away from me in the first few seconds of
new blood. The clean, unsullied blood invigorates me, and I love it. It
feels so fundamental. I'll do it again and again. I'll drain a thousand
babies if it gives me one more day of life. I might be a monster but I'm
not going without a fight. I
will not submit. Not until I run out of babies. And this world will never run
out of unwanted babies. They aren't unwanted, I want them, I want their
blood. I want their youth.

[*ITEM] Blood and Souls

[*AUTHOR] Peter Morrison

[*BLURB] If this is insanity, it's insanity gone mad!

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<p class=drop>The black maze walls gleam, shine, she should be able to see her
reflection in their surface, she thinks. But there is something wrong
about the whole material, something particularly unnatural. Hate
thinks of black holes and the way that they absorb light, the way they
suck in everything that gets close. She takes another step forward.
The walls tower overhead. As far as she can see - black, overwhelming
walls. She traces a hand along the glassine surface, a habit she can't
help, that need to touch things, even if for a moment. Now, she
hesitates. It is hard, with no sense of give. More than any other
surface she has touched in her time in the city, the endless surfaces
she has caressed in attempts to verify her continued existence, she
has the least doubt that this surface is real. She pulls her hand
away, losing heat to that evil wall, losing a little skin as well, she
suspects, her fingers stinging a little where they touched the
surface. Or is that her imagination?

<div class=pullquote>If you squinted
you could almost imagine that those three triangles lined up in a row
might represent something like a crown, as depicted by a child
perhaps.</div>Hate had been adopted as a baby, had known no other life, and her
parents had not been forthcoming with any information that gave her a
clue as to where she had come from. As far as she knew it was her
parents that had picked the name Hatred, though she had never been
able to fathom why they had picked that name of all names. It was
certainly a name that had haunted her, who would let their children
play with a girl called Hate? Other children had been cruel to her,
her response being twofold - to withdraw and have as little 
as possible to do with
anyone else and to get angry and lash out at anyone who pushed
forcibly against the walls that she built around her. Her parents
hadn't helped, had given her little support, and she was often left
wondering why they had adopted a child at all. In her teens she
retreated further, into books, into fiction, into fantasy novels, she
devoured them by the dozen - borrowed them from the local
library, or bought them second-hand with the little money she could scrape
together here or there.

Logically there were two generic explanations - she was a screaming
lunatic in a mental hospital somewhere back home or she had somehow
found one of those famous, fictional gateways between one dimension
and another. With the first being the more plausible explanation she
had spent every day here waiting for the reveal, the lucid moment in a
hospital, where it all made an appalling sense. But here she was,
years gone by, surrounded by animal spirits and demons, monsters in
the night, and a world which otherwise seemed not that much different
from her own - people had jobs, read books, listened to music, caught
the bus as it went round the city and all sorts of other nice normal,
sane activities. She didn't feel mad, she didn't feel crazed, in fact,
and she was loath to 
admit this to herself at any point, if anything
she actually felt as though she had finally come home. Things had been
great, life had been interesting, for all the peculiarities of this
place, until a few nights ago.

When she turned 21 she had had enough, she was leaving it all behind,
she was disappearing from life as part of family Philips. She planned,
had built up a reserve of cash, from Saturday jobs and paper rounds
over the years, before she had gotten on that bus to leave Glasgow
behind. She had planned to go to London. She had told no one of her
intentions, after all, who was there to tell; so she had no real sense
of making a cut when she got on that bus and left it all behind. She
was disappointed by that sense of a lack of closure, that failure to
have a tangible sense of having given someone the finger. She presumed
that someone would notice she was gone, sooner or later; perhaps even
make some token attempt to find out that she had taken a bus to
London, though she couldn't be sure anyone would make any effort at
all. Regardless of whether anyone ever did work out that she had
intended to go to London, tracked that ticket she bought, she had
fallen asleep on the bus, and instead of London she had arrived in
this strange other city, a sprawling place which was reputed to go on
forever, the city of Ascension. The creation myths she had picked up
along the way suggested that the city was everything; that outside the
city there was nothing; further, that no one had actually ever reached
the end of the city. Which would seem, of course, to contradict the
stories of the sea that she also heard.

<p class=drop>Returning to her front door with a foxy girl she'd picked up on a
night out, she had discovered a sword, leaning innocently on the doorpost, for
no reason that she could determine. She had been out
clubbing, trying to distract herself from the more complex aspects of
her life, when she'd run into a group of pack girls, she had picked up
this one, and brought her home for the night, not expecting to find
this plain-looking thing in a battered sheath here waiting for her. It
was almost more of a machete than a sophisticated weapon like she
thought a sword should be, plain as plain could be, save for the three
triangles on the hilt which matched those which had been carved into
the surface of her door, presumably by whoever had left the weapon,
and in a manner that was no doubt intended to be deeply significant,
if only she had the slightest idea what it might mean. If you squinted
you could almost imagine that those three triangles lined up in a row
might represent something like a crown, as depicted by a child
perhaps. She had brought the weapon into her flat, thrown it into one
of the armchairs and gone back to the business of taking the giggling
young stray to her bed. 

Woken in the night by the sound, chilled by
the sick red light of that hideous moon, Hate had pushed the armchair
against the front door, the sword still sitting there. Then the pair
of them had clung together in bed, terrified, while they heard the
screams and hideous sounds of death come shuffling. Everyone else in
the building had been slaughtered. In the morning, the two of them
were the only survivors.

All signs that she could find suggested that whatever had happened,
the persons responsible for Salsa's disappearance were the same as
those responsible for the darkening of certain areas of the city.
Rumour being that someone lived in the heart of corruption, that there
was a castle grown from the ground, in which evil had taken residence.

So here she is, following the trail of Salsa's disappearance into the
darkening streets of the city, into the heart of whatever evil had
come to power here; this creeping expansion that seems to consume
another street each day. She clutches the handle of that sword, the
sheath strapped to her belt the sense of those three triangles against
the flesh of her hand somehow reassuring.

There had been no apparent explanation as to why they hadn't been
devoured like everyone else. The police who found them there the next
morning were amazed, having waded through so many floors of carnage.
Pushing each door open carefully with their spears to reveal the
horror within. Surprised to find resistance here, to find a
traumatised Hate easing the door open in response to their calls. Hate
had looked at those triangles again, the one on the right traced out
in red, blood having run down the grain from that contact - they had
come that far and paused- why? Was it something to do with those
triangles, while everyone else counted her blessings, she wondered
what other forces were at work. Particularly when it was around the
same time that Salsa had gone missing, her best friend, the true
object, the unobtainable object, of her affections - the one she would
much rather have taken to her bed than some club girl strayed from her
pack. Gone.

<p class=drop>She takes another step forward. Round a corner she comes to a square.
It would probably have been quite a nice place at some time in the
past. Blackened cafes, blackened chairs, blackened fountain and
blackened statues. The statues are of great lions, their aspect is
fearsome, and Hate would almost swear that their attention is focused
entirely upon her and her progress. She takes another step forward.
The lions, to her relief, show no reaction. Though there is a sound
behind her somewhere, something is back there, or a number of things,
moving fast, and making a lot of noise about it. Something that seems
to be headed in her direction. Hate can only be certain that this is
bad news. She starts to run, a careful trot, consciously pacing her
energy as she crosses the square, leaving it behind as she enters
another black corridor, leading round black corners, to more black
corridors - buildings that were once houses and businesses absorbed
into the monolith. She would like to feel as though she was heading
somewhere, as though she wasn't about to turn a corner and find a
fatal dead end, but she has no such assurance and can only conclude
that by keeping in motion she keeps the possibilities open.

The sounds behind her keep getting closer and she fights against the
spike in her pulse, the natural sense of fear which threatens to
overwhelm her. She can hear scraping, and dragging sounds. The first
thing that comes to mind is that she is being pursued by zombies,
those monstrosities responsible for the attack on her building, the
undead creatures who formed nests in the city's abandoned buildings.
At this point she is probably the only thing resembling fresh meat for
some distance, most people having the sense to avoid the expanding
dark zones. If they catch her they will certainly tear her apart. She
draws her sword and starts to run faster, hoping that running and
carrying swords are compatible activities. Adrenalin starts to churn,
Hate actually smiles, the rush, the energy - she runs every day,
pounding the streets, exploring the world, ensuring that it remains a
constant, getting miles in before the start of her shift at the record
shop, but that is not like this. The street she is in splits, a wide
dead end in one direction, a narrowing alley that looks as if it might
go further.

She makes a choice, and she crouches in the narrow corridor. Gripping
her sword. Telling herself she is ready for first contact. Though,
given that until she found this weapon she had never actually even
held a sword, she can't help but feel a little absurd. A figure
staggers into sight. A second and third are just visible behind. The
first figure stops. As Hate presumed, they are zombies. Not too
bright. It takes them a moment to work out where she has gone.
Sniffing her brains, fragments of nostrils held up, inhaling noisily.
The pus-filled orbs that take the place of eyes attempt to focus in
her direction. Once this figure was a man, a big one, now he is a
broken thing. He would still tear her head open, rip her brains out
and slap them around his face as though they were some fine delicacy.
Of course, Hate has no intention of letting that outcome arise. More
zombies come behind the first three, a couple shoving at each other
pointlessly as they try and get further ahead, one crawling, legless
thing snakes its way past the log jam the other two create. Arms
outstretched, in a manner that Hate thinks is distinctly clichd, the
lead zombie lumbers towards her. He groans, rank breath carrying
fragments of what might once have been words in Hate's direction. She
holds her crouch steady. The blade in her hand feels right. The burn
of adrenalin is still buzzing through her. The zombie swings an arm at
her. She stands, stepping forward, driving the blade straight through
his chest in an upward sweep, slicing up and out through his neck.
Sludge spurts and falters. The zombie keeps moving, delayed reactions
and momentum know no mercy. But another couple of slashes and the
bastard goes down, though as he does the crawling zombie, grinning
obscenely through a lipless mouth, climbs up the tumbling carcass. Its
blackened nails claw at the body to gain purchase. Coiling, the thing
prepares to leap at her like some ghastly frog. One slash and the head
goes flying, the thing unbalancing in the process. The stream of the
dead keeps on coming. Hate's sword seems to pulse with an energy as
she swings recklessly, hacking body parts left and right.

<p class=drop>"Blood and souls! Blood and souls for Arioch," Hate suddenly shouts,
the phrase from one of Moorcock's novels popping into her head,
grinning like a psychotic. While her weapon might not be leaching
energy from her enemies, the way that Elric's evil weapon Stormbringer
did in those novels, it does make hacking up zombie bits seem easy.
She can't help but feel she has become like a character in one of
those books that she read when she was a teenager, of how she finds
herself living in one of those books now, how she is the heroine in an
impossible situation. Hatred Philips, twenty-three years old, and
fighting for her life. At least until enough carcasses have mounted up
in that alley that it has become difficult for the zombies to get any
nearer, which she takes as her cue, to turn, and to run. Salsa is in
here somewhere, what kind of hero would she be if she fell at the
hands of the zombie horde and failed to save the woman she loves?

[*ITEM] From an Evening at the Cinema

[*AUTHOR] Matthew Kirshenblatt

[*BLURB] Ahhh... the sparkling silver screen.

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>They watched the faded white and grey
screen as Count Orlock staggered across the room. Having drunken Mina's
blood, he was helpless as the white unforgiving light opened from the
black cloth drapes and spread over his awkward and elongated body. As it
touched him, he vanished. Only the dying maiden on her death bed was
evidence that he had ever existed to begin with.

Then, as Hutter held his wife's pale and fragile form, there is a scene
of the Carpathian Mountains and the lights turn on, making the screen in
front of everyone look like a dried and yellow parchment of archaic and
indecipherable symbols from another time entirely. The downtown
University showing of Nosferatu was over.

As the students and senior citizens filed out of the room, the two men
followed quietly behind them all.

"It's a sad thing," said the older of the two, though he physically looked 
no older, "As I believe Murnau himself once said, 'If it is
not in frame, it does not exist.'"

"Or it no longer exists," the younger of the two replied, "That says a
lot about this age."

"Yes. It really does."

The two walked outside into a beautiful sunset. It was mid-summer
afternoon and the sky was orange and golden.

"They really think we look like that creature?" the younger man shook
his head.

"They think that we look like a lot of things, my friend," the older man
stared up at the setting sun, "It's funny. Before this film was ever
created, we could always walk around in the sun. Even in Bram Stoker's
novel. We were just not as powerful."

"Though strong enough for any mortal to think twice," the young man
swung his arms absently, "It is ridiculous what they all believe these
days."

"That is not the greatest tragedy though."

"Oh," the young man spared a sidelong glance at a passing young woman 
and her pink healthy neck, "And what is that, old man?"

The other man smiled wryly. Then he sighed, "The greatest tragedy is not
that mortals began to think we could die from sunlight," he told him as
they passed into the shadows of the city, "Rather, it's the fact that we
have actually begun to believe it."

"Well," the younger one said, "At least most of us don't sparkle yet."

The older man looked down for a few moments, and smiled despite himself,
"Yes, my friend. That is true enough."

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>"End of round four!</i></b>"

I slumped on the stool and spat out the guard. Lenny, my trainer, fussed around me with a wet sponge.

"Keep moving kid, you gotta' keep moving. Use your speed, watch your footwork. You can take him, sure thing."

I took a long swig of water and spat, conscious of how pink it came out.

"Take him, Lenny? It's a bloody android, for Christ's sake. I'm getting murdered out there."

He leaned in close, his voice a rasping whisper.

"More human than human, right? That's the synthetic creed, yeah? Well,
all the SporTek models are based on old-school fighters and I think this
joker is mimicking Sonny Liston. Long reach, big hitter, not big on
uppercuts and such."

I flexed arms and shoulders, eyeing my impassive opponent.

"This helps me how, exactly?"

Lenny licked his lips and speared some more Vaseline over my right brow.

"Vulnerable jaw. Maybe."

I snorted.

"Maybe? That's the best you got?"

"That's the best you got, kid. You're Anvil Andy, the one-shot wonder. Get him open and put him down."  

<b><i>"Seconds out, round five!"</i></b>

I came out dancing, ignoring the jeers and cat-calls from the partisan
crowd. 'Sonny' was a smooth mover, all direct advances and
straightforward combination punches. We traded blows against guard with
little real damage. He was cut bad over the left eye and although I knew
it was just cosmetic there had to be - by statute - some soft spot on
his frame that would give me a KO. 

And it had to be a knock-out, and soon, as I <i><b>was</b></i> getting murdered out
here. Way behind on points and with the rib damage to prove it. Sonny
had a big left arm but didn't fight southpaw - unless maybe I could
tempt him into breaking his stride. I went in close with a quick flurry
so he gave ground, then dropped my right like it was giving me trouble.

He lashed out with his left, coming off the back foot so it didn't have
his full weight behind it, but his fist was the size of a dinner plate.
I stepped into it, chin down, bringing my right up in a sweeping
uppercut.

There was a jolt, like touching a live wire.

"FIVE!"

The world had suddenly shifted sideways and something seemed to be pressing against my face.

"Get up Andy! Come on! All you have to do is get off the canvas!"

"SIX!"

I was face down with Lenny shouting at me from the ringside. I lifted my
right glove and hung it over the lowest rope. The background noise from
the crowd was deafening, an incomprehensible clamour.

"SEVEN!"

I managed to lift my torso off the canvas, pulling with my right and
pushing up with my left. My right knee up eased up almost to my waist.

"EIGHT!"

I dug my right toe in and pushed up, climbing the ropes, hand over hand.

"NINE!"

I stood, planted both feet on the canvas. Raised my gloves. Turned.

<div class=pullquote>"That was a damn bear pit
out there and I've got crowd sweat, popcorn and God knows what in my
hair. And that was supposed to be the VIP section."</div>
The world spun, but I concentrated on the solid feel of the ring beneath
me. The referee jerked into my field of vision; a small, wizened man
with slicked-back blond hair. He spoke, gazing into my eyes, a hand on
my shoulder, but the words were meaningless. I slapped my gloves
together and rotated my neck.

"I'm fine, ref. Bit shook up there but ready to continue."

I felt his eyes scan my face and then he nodded, pulling back and to my
side, holding my right arm aloft. Crowd noise washed over me like a
tidal wave of bedlam.

Sonny lay on the canvas in front of me, his eyes the solid blue of a systems crash.

I remember standing there, arms held aloft, but the rest is just a blur.
There were officials, and Lenny helping me from the ring, and event
security helping us forge a passage through the jostling crowd.

The dressing room was an oasis of calm and I sat on the treatment table
while Mutt and Jeff unlaced my gloves. Mutt and Jeff were Lenny's
assistants; two identical Beta-class androids in matching track suits.
The only way to tell them apart was that Jeff wore an &Uuml;ber-Brawn
baseball cap, although I suspected they occasionally swapped it over.

The event medic gave me a clean bill of health while the Boxing
Commission flunky inspected my gloves for EMP emitters or similar gizmos
which might have floored Sonny. Lenny was sporting a large, unlit, cigar
in his mouth - one of his little rituals each time I win - and had to
keep removing it each time he spoke. He put a hot towel round my neck
and started rummaging in his bag of tricks.

"Right, kid. Can't do anything about the surface bruising, you'll just
have to live with it. I think you got problems with your ribcage, though,
the way you struggled through the ropes. So try a little of this..."

He applied a null-state gas injector to my torso and it felt like a finger flicked against the skin.
 
"...just a little nanite repair crew. Fix you up for sure."

"Cheers, Lenny! I'll end up more mech than the SporTek cans at this rate."

He grinned.

"Nah, nah, strictly limited lifespan and leaves only a carbon residue. You got-"

There was a swell of sound as the door opened. Amanda ran across to me
and I slid from the table to meet her embrace. She buried her head in my
chest as Perry, my manager, addressed the press.

"There you are, ladies and gentlemen, Andy 'The Anvil' Harrison.
Undefeated in twelve fights, only three of which have gone the distance.
Now, if you'd kindly let the boy have a few moments with his fianc&eacute;e
we'll see you all at the press conference."

Security guards closed the door against a barrage of flash photography
and questions while Perry turned and walked towards us. I'm a fan of
old cinema and the guy is the spitting image of Peter Lorre, right down
to the slightly indeterminate accent. Since I mentioned this, Perry had
adopted certain affectations, like the short cigarette holder he
gestured with, and was the very definition of the word 'dapper'.

Amanda pushed herself away from me with an 'Ugh!' of revulsion.

"You're not paying me enough for this, Perry. That was a damn bear pit
out there and I've got crowd sweat, popcorn and God knows what in my
hair. And that was supposed to be the VIP section."

Amanda was Perry's idea at generating a little human interest. She
comes to all my fights, sitting there in tortured anguish as I get beat
up, radiant triumph when I win. Perry makes sure we have separate hotel
rooms on tour (for the Moral Majority) but with a connecting door (for
the tabloids). Not that I'm interested, though, as we have about as much
sexual chemistry as a dirty puddle.

Perry lit his cigarette and blew smoke towards the buzzing overhead lights.

"Your contract is for twenty fights, Mandy, my dear, but feel free to
walk out at any time. The agreement is tighter than a pre-nuptial and
just as intimate in its constraints, so you'd be expected to pay back
your retainer, plus interest."

She glared at him and I half expected some screaming rant, but instead
she stormed over to the mini-bar and hit the vodka. My manager regarded
me with a patently insincere smile on his lips.

"Andy, my boy! I must admit you had us going for a moment when you went
down in the third, but I can see now it was all just a ploy to increase
the dramatic tension. I'm pleased you've taken my little talk about
enhancing the performance to heart."

I opened my mouth, but Lenny was right in there.

"Screw you, Perry! My boy was getting hammered out there and that win
was more luck than judgement. I just can't keep patching him up and
sending him back into the ring week after week - we need some serious
down-time!"

Mutt and Jeff sidled off to one side in response to the obvious tension but Perry was all smiling affability.

"Your contribution is appreciated, Lenny, truly. There aren't many out
there with your skills, your expertise, your commitment. I'd be deeply
sorry should you feel unable to continue as part of this project, and it
would be extremely difficult to replace you. But not impossible. Are we
clear?"

Lenny removed his cigar and spat the chewed-off end at Perry's feet.

"You listen to me, shit-head. I heard all about those jokers in the
Boxing Commission wanting to change who Andy has to face down the line.
It's your pals from the SenSen and mediaCore networks twisting a few
arms, yeah? Am I right or am I right?"

My manager's smile became little more than a thin line.

"Nothing but gossip and idle speculation! Of course the big boys want to
enhance their product and, quite frankly, no-one expected Andy to get
this far undefeated. The whole twenty fights in twenty weeks schedule
has captured the public interest but the pay-per-view market doesn't
like a sure thing. Unfortunately that's what a match featuring The Anvil
is in danger of becoming - a one-sided contest. He's already bested
twelve heavyweights, including five of SporTek's finest, and that has
earned him <i><b>no</b></i> favours, let me tell you!"

It was slightly weird, watching them get into it like that. They were
both short, slightly built men and it felt a bit like tugs fussing round
a lumbering cargo vessel. I stepped forward, feeling awkward.

"Hey, guys..."

Lenny ignored me.

"So what's next, Perry? Suspending the class limitations and sending in
a super-heavyweight? You really want to see our boy get his head taken
off?"

"Guys, really..."

Perry ignored me.

"That was an option, yes, but I came up with an alternative which I felt
would capture the imagination of both crowd and promoter."

He looked at me and smiled in triumph.

"The next opponent Andy faces will be himself."

<p class=drop>I expected Lenny to spit out his cigar in disgust, but instead he stood
there for a moment, moving it from side-to-side in his mouth. 

"Yeah, yeah, that might work. Even with an identical physical match-up
Andy has learned boxing from the ground up, and that gives him a huge
advantage against any programmed opponent. If SporTek think-"

"&Uuml;ber-Brawn, actually".

Perry was inspecting the fingernails on his left hand and tried to keep his voice nonchalant, but Lenny blew up anyway.

"<i><b>&Uuml;ber-Brawn?</b></i> Our own <i><b>sponsors</b></i> are in on
this? Hell, why not keep it simple and just have the boy throw a few
fights instead!"

Perry actually had the good grace to look slightly uncomfortable.

<div class=pullquote>"...it's all just theatre when you get down to it. We
all have our parts to play..."</div>"Well, that course of action has been intimated..." he saw the look on
Lenny's face and continued, just a little hurriedly, "...but of course I
refused to play ball. Look, Lenny, be realistic, U-B are under intense
pressure to make these contests more, ah, <i><b>dramatic</b></i>, and it's obvious
that Andy can beat SporTek in a fair fight. This was the best option I
could come up with - or would you rather see our boy face a real monster
with jacked-up reflexes and no soft-spot?"

Lenny turned his back on Perry, motioning for Mutt and Jeff to step in
and start removing my hand wraps. I could see the tic in his cheek, a
sure sign he would take his anger out on the heavy bag later.

"So U-B sold us out? I take it the opposition will get Andy's full
physical work-up and training video history? Jeez, Perry, anything else
you want to spring on us?"

My manager smiled, all charm.

"Lenny, Lenny, Lenny, it's all just theatre when you get down to it. We
all have our parts to play and-"

"Theatre? <i><b>Theatre</b></i>? You step in that ring and it's the real deal, no
second chances. Every time he puts on the gloves Andy knows he could get
smashed up, or worse, so don't stand there and tell me it's all just play
acting."

Perry kept smiling, but his eyes were like stone.

"Lenny, look at you, you're a walking stereotype. The wise old trainer
who takes the promising kid under his wing for a shot at the title.
Andy, the contender who'll risk everything to fulfil his dream. Amanda,
the glamorous, supportive girlfriend. Even me, the shyster manager
willing to risk his fighter's well-being for a few extra bucks."

He paused, gesturing around the dressing room.

"This, all of this, is just a carefully manufactured image to make the product more media-friendly."

Lenny turned and jabbed at Perry with his cigar.

"Not in here. Not in the ring. We'll put up with all the window dressing
you want but never get in the way of the boxing or -"

Perry held up both hands in mock surrender.

"Lenny, Lenny, I know! We're all on the same team, really. On the plus
side if, sorry, when, Andy gets past his next opponent the Commission
have agreed to bring forward the title bout against Khan."

Lenny frowned.

"What happened to the whole twenty-in-twenty setup then?"

"That was always a gimmick, Lenny, you know that. Just my way of
breaking an unknown fighter into the professional circuit. The networks
will cut in the unused venues for a share of the media rights in lieu of
cancellation penalties. Everyone stays sweet and you get to see Andy
tread the golden canvas. World heavyweight champion. Has a nice ring to
it, eh? Plus, of course, if I can get Andy to a title then I'll be able
to write my own ticket when it comes to managing other contenders."

Nobody asked my opinion. They never do.

I could see Lenny chewing this over and Perry took his silence as agreement.

"Excellent! So for one night only we have the exciting prospect of seeing two Anvils in action."

Amanda looked up from the mini-bar, her faced flushed, an empty glass swaying in her grasp.

"I'm not doing a threesome, no way! Not unless I get exclusive rights to
all media content." She burped, frowned. "Anyway, I didn't think he was
into all that."

"Mandy, my dear, let me explain..."

Perry sidled over to her and Lenny turned back to me, concern haunting his eyes.

"You take all that in, kid? You'll be facing an opponent modelled on
yourself, one that knows all your moves, all your strengths and
weaknesses."

"Yeah, yeah, I get it, Lenny. Kind of like that mirror boxing stuff you have me do, 'cept he hits back."

I grinned, bringing my freed fists up in a classic pose. "But I'll 
have the edge, right? Like you said, I've learned boxing the
hard way. No implanted responses or easy access techniques."

He smiled and held his palms up for me to slap in a quick combination, but his eyes stayed wary.

"Won't be that easy, Andy, no way. You can bet your bottom dollar
SporTek will come up with some way to wangle an advantage out of
the Commission. Harder hitting maybe, or slightly faster. Something to
compensate for your natural edge."

Perry looked up from mixing himself a vodka martini.

"Sorry boys, maybe I didn't make myself clear. Andy won't be facing a
standard SporTek boxing android this time, that's obviously lost its
appeal." 

He popped in an olive.

"I'm not sure exactly what they've got planned but the tag-line for the
fight is already out. Very dramatic. Catchy, in a neo-biblical way."

Lenny and I exchanged glances. Perry whispered to Amanda and she giggled, saluting me with a toast.

"The Anvil meets his maker." 

<p class=drop>Lenny stuck me in the tank and kept me there for four
days. It's designed for dermal regeneration but this time they also
stuck me with these needles and biomonitors like I was facing major
surgery. I didn't feel a thing, of course, and went from giving Lenny a
thumbs-up to groaning on the recovery pad.

My body burned.

Lenny covered my shoulders with a big towel and started rubbing me dry.

"Sorry, kid, that was a bit extreme, even for someone as used to it as
you. Ran you with as much I-V fluids and diuretics as I dared, to flush
the crap out of your system. Just couldn't match the build-up of toxins
towards the end there. It'll pass, I promise, and you'll feel the
benefit of it."

I coughed and hawked up some of the saline solution they have me floating in. It always gets up my nose, no matter what.

"Feels like I've been run over, Lenny. What the hell you do to
me?"

He grimaced.

"Bit more than just toning, that's for sure. Look, try and stand, move
about a bit. The more active you are the faster you'll recover."

I stood, but my legs were uncertain and I had to sit on the bench,
conscious of the cold plastic against my skin. I started shivering,
gagged, and was sick. Nothing much came up, just bile, but I felt a bit
better afterwards.

Lenny brought me a high-protein smoothie and one for himself. It's all
he takes following stomach cancer a ways back, so he told me, and he put
me onto the same r&eacute;gime right after he became my trainer. Some days it's
like I can't remember eating anything else, and my guts have long
forgotten what real food tastes like. Made me hard and lean inside
though, and Lenny says that's good - the more my guts shrink the less
they can move if I get hit. Less movement, less damage.

I sucked on the straw and made a face.

"Jeez, Lenny! What's this supposed to be?"

He peered at the label as he really should wear glasses for reading.

"Strawberry. Maybe. Berry something at least. I didn't have time to buy
the ingredients so I bought some ready made from that wholefood deli
across the street. Anyway, Perry has you booked in for a romantic
evening meal at some swanky restaurant, so I figured you better have
something to eat beforehand."

"With Amanda?"

He laughed.

"Well, you're sure as hell not my type! Not Perry's either, although he
dresses like a fag. No, it's one of those photo-calls he's so fond of,
for the media. You know the drill - the Anvil and his fiance share an
intimate moment ahead of his big fight."

I swallowed some more and tried to put a name to the taste. I failed.

"Evening meal, Lenny? Let me guess, that means a steak with all the trimmings?"

"Yeah, yeah, I know. Don't worry though, you'll have a whole bunch of
little munchers to tackle the solids. I'll put them in that bio-drink
you're promoting."

He took the unfinished shake from me as I tried standing again. At least
the world didn't come up to smack me in the mouth but it still felt like
I'd just run ten K. On all fours.

"Still hurts like hell when I pass the residue though. Can't you come up
with something that just dissolves all that stuff completely?"

He passed me a pair of shorts and I didn't fall over while putting them on.

"Sorry, kid, but nanites can only do so much. Just be thankful it's the consistency of porridge. Now, make fists."
 
He held his palms up and I jabbed. With my left. I stopped, staring at
my hands like they reminded me of something I'd forgotten, something I'd
dreamed about.

"Lenny? What's going on?"

He nodded and smiled, but without humour.

"Listen up kid, if there was any other way I'd have taken it. I'd love
to blame Perry for this but it was my idea, plain and simple."

He paused, running a hand over his mouth.

"You're now a southpaw, Andy. Implanted response. Not permanent, I promise."

I shied away, two steps back, my scalp tight with fear.

"An implant? <i><b>An implant</b></i>? You've messed with my head? For God's sake, Lenny, I trusted you!"
 
He stepped up and grabbed my forearms, his eyes like stone.
"<i><b>Listen to me</b></i>. We needed something. You needed something, something
wildcard, something the opposition won't expect. You're still the same
inside, really. It's just a switch, a crossover. You think right, your
body responds left. Got it?"

I shook him off and flexed my right hand, seeing the fingers on my left respond.

"But my punch, the big K-O, it's the wrong arm. It's all just wrong."

He slapped me across the face, gun-shot loud in the empty room.
 
"Feel the power in your left arm. Go on, try it! Trust me, kid, you
don't want to know what it took, but there's nothing left in your system
that won't pass muster with the boxing commission. Move it, feel it,
feel the extra power. "

My reflection twisted and turned in the full length mirror as I
inspected myself. I'd never been 'crabbed' - one arm hugely
over-developed - but my left had always been the junior partner. Now it
felt like I was using my right, just it was a bit lighter, a bit
underpowered. I tried a few basic combinations, jabs, a flurry,
uppercut, rest. Lenny stood behind me, trying to sound encouraging.

"There, kid, you see. Not so bad. In the ring, you won't hardly notice,
you'll be too focused on the other guy. Your guard and counter-punching
will be a bit off to start, but I've got a session booked in the gym for
you to practice in. Get dressed now."

He slapped me on the shoulder and turned away while I stood there,
looking at myself in the mirror, wishing I could trade places.

I got dressed in tracksuit and trainers and followed Lenny down the
corridor, still feeling like I was one stage removed from my body. Then
the penny dropped.

"You've got a session booked in a gym? What's wrong with this place, you
got the decorators in or something?"

He glanced back over his shoulder and led the way out into reception.

"Perry's idea, kid. He thinks the place might be bugged - spy cameras
and all that high-tech crap. I think he's just blowing smoke but given
the little surprise we got planned you can't be too careful. Friend of
mine has a gym across town, so we'll have exclusive use of it today."

There were two big guys waiting for us, all loose-fitting suits,
anti-flash contact lenses and double earpieces. Lenny just grunted and
headed out the door with our escort trailing along behind. At the kerb
were three identical black SUVs with tinted windows and we piled into
the middle one. Our little convoy drove off with an obvious camera crew
following.

"Lenny, isn't this all a bit..."

He grimaced. "Melodramatic? Yeah, well, partly serious and partly just play-acting
for the media. Look, kid, a couple of bookies came to Perry on the sly,
asking if the fight had been fixed. You were the clear favourite going
into this but a lot of serious money has started shifting to your
opponent, so they're getting nervous."

I fiddled with my seatbelt as we drove through a maze of dilapidated light industrial units.
"You think some word of what SporTek's got planned has leaked out?"

"More like inside information being used to make a fast buck. We're
talking betting syndicates here, people who don't like surprises. We
could make a lot of people unhappy when you win, and that means the
betting on the title fight will be something else. Oh, they've given
your opponent a name - 'Anton Marx'."

"A full name, like for a regular person? Why they go and do that?"
 
Lenny shrugged. 
"Beats me. I checked it out and it's not even a name used by anyone on
the circuit. Maybe they're just trying to personalise the fight, make it
less like the usual match-up where you pound one of their cans into the
canvas. Look, it'll take the best part of an hour to get there, so you
rest and don't worry about the window dressing, OK?"

So I dozed, tired despite having been unconscious for four days, until Lenny touched my shoulder.

"We're here, kid. You wait by the car while I check everything's kosher."

We were in an overgrown alley in the midst of a run-down residential
neighbourhood. The cars disgorged a posse of security who stood about,
scanning the windows and doorways facing us. I was bored.

Then, it was the weirdest thing, but I swear I saw Lenny cross the end
of the alley, like he'd come out the front door and was making tracks.
Same rolling gait, same knitted cap, and I was on the point of calling
out when Lenny himself appeared at the side entrance and ushered me inside.
He hustled down the corridor, pointing as he went.

"Right kid, you got steam room, dry sauna, plunge pool. Changing rooms
over there, gym back through here, OK? We'll just use the cushion pads
rather than wraps and I'll lace you up when you're ready. Get a move
on!"

I swapped trainers for boots and put on helmet,
fingerless inner gloves and regular boxing gloves on top. Pushing
through the double doors into the gym I found Lenny had arranged a
sparring partner; shaven head, shorter than me by an inch or so but
heavier across the shoulders. 

"Andy, this here is Tony Poletti. Five professional fights before a
detached retina put him out of business. Still keeps in shape and we're
paying him to give you a run-through. We've paying him even more to sit
in a hotel room with babysitters until after you step into the ring for
real, so everything that happens here, stays here."

Lenny laced up my gloves while Tony pulled on a helmet and ran a few
combinations to loosen up. Once we were all in the ring my trainer laid
down the law.

"Right then. Fight when I say 'fight', break when I say 'break'. Despite
the helmets I don't want to see any head shots. This is all about Andy
getting used to fighting as a southpaw so you can both be as quick as
you like, but not serious. Got that?"

We both nodded and murmured our understanding, touched gloves and stood back.

"Right then. Fight!"

I got nailed.

A regular fighter can go his entire career without facing a left-handed
opponent, so the chances to develop a response are limited. A southpaw
is the exact opposite and knows how to fight match-up; lead hand against
lead hand.

I didn't know what the hell I was doing and just floundered away,
striking at openings that weren't there for a left-handed blow. If I
took the time to translate right-into-left then the moment was gone and
I just slapped leather. Tony adjusted quickly and kept sliding away to
his left, bringing his strong right up against what - in a southpaw -
should have been my weaker hand. Of course it wasn't, so I got cocky and
concentrated on getting my left into play.

The world blinked.

"Break, break! I said no head shots! What did I say about no head shots?"

Somehow I was lying flat out on the canvas, with Tony looking a bit sheepish.

"Sorry, man, but Jeez, his guard was just static. He couldn't be more
open if his hands were taped to his sides!" 

Lenny bent over me, frowning.

"He's right, kid, you were lousy. I just hope it was as painful to take as it was painful to watch."

He helped me to my feet and stood there, hands on hips.

"Looks like it's time for plan 'B'."

I shook my head to try and clear it, like that ever does any good, and
took a couple of deep breaths. The world still seemed a bit off-balance.

"Ah, what? What plan?"

Lenny snapped his fingers in front of my face.

"Listen up! Usually you dance around for a couple of rounds, staying out
of trouble until you get a feel for your opponent. Well, that ain't
gonna' fly this time, that's for sure."

Tony added his two cents.

"I seen you fight Mancini and you're a counterpuncher all right. Right
now your responses are about as fluid as that chair over there. You got
no chance, even against a hack like me."

My trainer continued.

"They're expecting clever but we're gonna' try crude instead. I want you
to come straight out and start punching like some slugger, OK? If you
need a breather then just put your head down and cover up. It won't be
pretty, and it sure as hell won't please the crowd hoping for a fancy
display of boxing between evenly matched fighters."

He coughed and wiped his face, suddenly looking real old.

"It might work, kid, and it's the best chance you got just now. You get
through this next fight and we'll go back to your natural style for the
title bout against Khan, I promise. You ready to continue?"

I nodded, not really sure what to do. Most fighters can mount a flurry
of between four and eight continual punches; left-rights, with the odd
uppercut for variety. Lenny wanted me to just get in close and trade
body-blows until one fighter wilted, pretty much just a test of
endurance rather than skill. If my opponent was as mobile as me, as I
usually was, then I'd end up chasing him all over the ring. My fight
against Boom-Boom Mancini had been like that, with me doing the dancing,
and I'd witnessed how frustrating it could be.

"OK then, fight!"

I just marched straight at Tony who stood his ground to see what
happened. I took three on the gloves and one to the gut, but just a tap.
Then I waded in, throwing punches and trying to find some sense of
rhythm. Eight, nine, ten blows against his guard, not letting up, not
giving him a chance to strike back. Tony gave ground, trying to slide
away, trying to get a bit of separation and mount his own attack. 

"Close up! Close up! Keep in there, keep punching!"

I really didn't need Lenny yelling at me as it was obvious this was a
do-or-die tactic. If my opponent could weather the storm I'd be
exhausted and off-balance - a three-minute round is one hell of a long
time when you're the one doing all the work.

Eleven, twelve, thirteen blows and I started a subconscious mantra;
right-in-to-left, right-in-to-left, right-in-to-left. I lost count of
the blows, only keeping up the rhythm mattered. 
 
Tony's right hand dropped slightly as he covered up his lower ribs and
my left lashed out - solid contact. Just his right shoulder, but it could
easily have been his face. He grunted and turned half away from me, open
to my in-swinging right.

"Break! Break!"

I stepped back, breathing hard, suddenly conscious of the sweat dripping
from me. Lenny stepped up to where Tony was flexing his shoulder.

"Well, what'd you think?"

My sparring partner grimaced.

"Might work. He's concentrating rather than boxing instinctively, but
that's working to your advantage. His eyes telegraph one blow, but his
fists do the opposite. Confusing as hell to start with. Add in the
unexpected southpaw and you might buy yourself a round of hesitation,
maybe two at the outside. Then your boy will get creamed."

Lenny nodded, seemingly satisfied, but I was a bit sceptical.

"Two rounds? Jeez, Lenny, none of my fights have gone less than three."

"Two rounds is all you've got at that pace, kid, and that's being
generous. When you face this Marx you march straight in there and batter
him down before they get a chance to alter his responses. That's the
plan. Now go use the heavy bag to cool down."

While I pummelled the leather Tony was whisked away by part of our
private security detail, presumably to a secure location outwith the
reach of inquiring minds. Lenny kept me on the bag for ages, alternating
with a running machine to give my upper torso a rest. Eventually he
called a halt, as it was obvious my arms felt like lead.

"Enough for today, Andy. Either you pick up the left-right swap, or you
don't. Simple as that. Hit the showers, get dressed, and I'll meet you
in the lounge area. Sorry there's no massage but I wanted the place to
ourselves."

I stood under the power shower for a long, long time. My days always
seemed so planned, even down to rest periods, that just taking my time
under the hot water felt like a guilty pleasure. Eventually I stepped
out, got dried and dressed, and made my way out into the shabby lounge -
a couple of beat-up sofas and a big plasma screen.

Lenny was flicking though an old copy of 'Prize Fighter', the one with
me on the cover. It always looked strange to see me like I was a real
person and not just some dumb kid riding his luck. He held up the
magazine as I approached.

"'Orphaned kid struggles against adversity to pursue his dream.' Brings a
tear to my eye. Or makes me want to puke, I can never remember which.
Ready?"

I laughed, although the 'orphaned' tag always hit me in the heart.  

"Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to rumble. Got to make myself presentable ahead of my dinner date with Amanda."

"Rather you than me, kid. She's hard as nails, that one. Anyway, I just
had Perry on the mobile. Apparently Otis Khan himself will be in the
audience to watch you fight. Now, to my way of thinking, that's the
action of a man who realises you might be a serious challenger. He wants
to take a look at you in action, before the two of you get up-close and
personal."

He grinned.

"Sounds like he believes you might be the real deal."

I grinned back.

"Lenny, I'm starting to believe that myself."


<p class=drop>The limo came for me around eight that evening; a stretch,
with SUV lead and chase cars. Hell, there were even a pair of police
motorcycle outriders, so I guess Perry had been promising tickets to
the title fight. There was the usual media tail but it's something I try
and blank out, and, anyway, the limo had tinted glass.

We picked up Amanda outside her apartment, where she was posing for some
more snaps and signing a few autographs. I'm not entirely sure what made
her any kind of celebrity, but she now rated private security to escort
her as far as the car door.

Once we were mobile her smile slipped like snow from a porch roof.

"Jeez, those press are like pack animals, you have to keep throwing them
bones. I'm getting tired of stopping to adjust my stocking just so some
hack can get a candid shot. You'd think they'd get bored, but no. You
want a drink?"

"Ah, hi, Amanda. I'll have a tonic water, thanks."

She busied herself in the minibar, incidentally giving me a fine view of
her rear. The sight did nothing for me, something I'd always wondered
about but never had the nerve to discuss with other guys in case they
thought I was a fag. Not that guys did it for me either, it just like
the whole sex thing is a non-event as far as I'm concerned.

Amanda sat back with a vodka martini and handed me a tonic water, with ice and lemon. It was nice she'd made the effort.

"You're looking real good this evening, Amanda. Classy."

She flashed me a brief smile through force of habit.

"Thanks. Designer dress, complements of Paul Degas. Fake jewellery
though, so I guess I'll have to wait until the title fight before
someone wants a mention of me wearing their stuff. Cheers!"

She took a generous mouthful and then put on her serious face.

"Look, Andy, my agent says to tell you that if you lose this next fight
then I'll be dumping you, OK? Nothing personal, it's just you're not
famous enough for me to go through the whole stand-by-your-man routine.
If you eventually win the title and then lose it, that's different,
unless you blow the rematch in which case you'd be history. OK?"

Amanda took another swallow while I considered this.

"Yeah, I get it. Look, you don't have to do me any favours, so if you'd
rather not come out this evening I'm sure Perry could spin it some way
that doesn't put you down."

"No, no, Andy, it's fine. Where are we going, anyway? L'Auberge? In The
Quarter? No, that's OK, it's a good place to be seen. Anyway, we need
more time together for the 'My life with the Anvil' article my agent has
been touting."

She finished her cocktail and a look of almost genuine concern flickered across her fine features.

"Andy, if you don't mind me asking, what will you do if you lose this next fight?"

I shrugged, feeling uncomfortable at having to confront real life.

"Well, I dunno, to be honest. Boxing is all I know, really. Lenny
spotted me when I was hanging about Potemkin's Gym, doing weights. I was
living in the half-way house after the orphanage, just killing time, you
know? I'd probably have ended up in the army or something like that, but
he said I already moved like a fighter and all he had to do was show me
the moves."

The memory lifted my spirits.

"It was great. Real hard work, but great. Twelve, fourteen hours a day.
Weights, the bag, running, then gradually sparring partners. Big guys,
tough, who knocked me on my ass more times than I care to remember.
Everyone said I was a natural, so that's what I decided I wanted to be."
 
Amanda patted my leg. "Very touching. I'm sure that'll make for a great montage sequence when
they film your life story. But to answer my question?"

"Seriously, Amanda, I've got no idea. Lenny said that I was like a blank
canvas, that I could have done just about anything. But he turned me
into a boxer and I guess that's who I am, not just what I do."

She laughed, half in exasperation.

"Men! Oh, we're here... You're doing it again."

The door was opened by a uniformed flunky and I paused, half out of my
seat, caught in the flicker of flash photography.

"What? Doing what again?"

Amanda spoke through her fixed media smile.

"Inside. Lets get to our table first."

The maitre d' seated us in person; a discreet table out of sight of
the main windows. He handed out menus, the wine list and a schedule of
when the press would be allowed access for some human interest shots. We
settled in and I placed myself in his hands as regards ordering. "An
excellent choice, monsieur." He murmured, removing the superfluous
literature. I waited until he had withdrawn before turning to my date.

"What did you mean, in the car, about me doing it again."

She sipped another martini.

"Every time we're out someplace, before every fight, I've seen you
scanning the crowd, as if you were looking for someone."

I blushed, took a sip of water.

"It's nothing, really. Just your imagination."

"Andy, I'm a blonde, I'm not supposed to have an imagination. Try again."

It felt like I was in a spotlight. I cleared my throat, playing with a napkin.

"It's just... I remember my mother. Just flashes, images, from when I
was real young. She was a vet or dental nurse or something, mostly in a
white coat. She didn't die or anything. I got Lenny to check and she
placed me in the orphanage when I was, like, three or four."

Amanda squeezed my hand, an entirely spontaneous gesture that threw me completely.

"Jesus, Andy, what a bitch! Well, that explains a lot. I described your
behaviour to my therapist and he said your emotional withdrawal was a
classic symptom of childhood trauma."

I blinked, pulled my hand away.

"You did what?"

"Look, Andy, that first night together when you showed zero interest in
me, well, what was I to think? You really undermined my sense of
self-worth. Especially so after you blanked Jon."

"Jon?"

She smiled.

"Perry's personal assistant? Slim, athletic body, big doe eyes? After I
told Perry you weren't interested he had Jon cozy up to you it case you
went that way instead. Seriously, you didn't notice? Actually I can
believe that. So, what, you're looking for your mother in the crowd?
After all these years? Talk about a TV movie moment!"

I was in danger of shredding the linen napkin and threw it on the table.

"Look, Amanda, just forget it, OK? I'm sorry I ever mentioned it...
Look, you're right, I know. It's just-"

I was talking to the hand and shut up, so that we sat in silence while
they brought our starters. I stared at my food, knowing it wasn't the
only thing I found hard to swallow.

<p class=drop>The day before a fight is pretty much a non-event as far
as Lenny and me are concerned. Just a little light road work to keep the
muscles moving, but no sparring or anything that might result in an
accidental injury. This time, though, we were pretty much besieged by
the media, so any outdoors running would have required a posse of
security to clear the way. Lenny just muttered under his breath and
yanked off his bicycle clips in frustration. So he put me on the
treadmill for a bit, plus some back-pedalling exercises to keep
up appearances, then it was just the steam room and a massage.

I had hours to idle away before bed, which is why I developed this thing
about watching old movies. Real old, black-and-white old, where the hero
generally wins through in the end and gets the girl. If not films, then
video of my opponent in action, in case anything last minute comes to
mind about his style and moves. Obviously that didn't apply this time
round so it was a light supper and early to bed.

I always sleep real sound before a fight, and I've come to suspect that
Lenny slips me something to make sure I don't have a restless night.
Whatever. Mid-morning they came and ferried us over to the New Oasis,
the casino/hotel complex which was tonight's venue. They gave us a nice
suite, but I was bored to tears. Calm, though. I'm always calm before a
fight, although I know some fighters get real restless. Lenny just sat
and read a book while I watched TV.

The lack of a pre-match press conference got some attention. Apparently
Khan's management didn't consider me 'a serious opponent, worthy of
media attention', which made me smile. These face-to-face encounters are
generally just so you diss the other fighter, make it seem that bit more
personal, but it's all just hype. When you face each other in the ring
it can't get more personal than that. 

Time went by. It always does.

They came for me in a group; event security, boxing commission
officials, Perry with some media hacks in tow. It was just a babble of
noise and activity with me in the centre, the eye of the storm, as I
went downstairs and across to the dressing room.

Mutt and Jeff helped me get ready and Lenny was murmuring a string of
last minute advice and encouragement but it was all happening to someone
else. Even when Perry ushered Amanda in for the obligatory pre-fight
kiss, on camera, it was like I was watching a re-run of my fight
history.

I was concentrating on my opponent, like I was trying to reach out and
connect with him. When it comes down to it there's just you and him, and
nothing else matters.

"Andy, it's time."

Lenny, looking into my eyes, his hand on my forearm. The real world had
returned. I smiled, nodded, and we took our place in the procession to
ringside. The venue was big, bigger than anything I'd fought in before,
and ablaze with flash photography. The crowd noise was mostly cheers and
encouragement, which was a first as well, but I concentrated on Lenny's
voice behind me -'Just keep walking, kid, eyes down, dignified. Just keep
walking...' It's his little mantra, something we've always shared.

Up and into the ring, sitting on my stool, a towel round my shoulders.
The MC stepped up with a radio mike in his hand, giving the pre-fight
spiel I try and tune out while waiting for my name.

"<i><b>...in the blue corner, weighing...</b></i>"

That was me - top billing. I'd never had top billing before. It made me feel hungry. 

"<i><b>...Andy, 'The Anvil', Harrison!</b></i>" 

Lenny whipped the towel away and I stood, both arms raised, to
acknowledge the crowd. I could barely see outside the lights but I knew
that Amanda would be waving frantically and blowing kisses, so I waved
back in the direction of the VIP area.

"<i><b>And in the red corner, from Toulon, France...</b></i>"

Man, they were really laying it on thick for this can. My opponent was
standing with his back to me, wearing a dressing gown with the hood up.
He even had what looked like a real trainer fussing over him, plus a big
black guy in a suit giving him some last minute instructions. Like it
would matter.

"<i><b>...heavyweight champion of the French Foreign Legion...</b></i>"

What?

"<i><b>...An-ton Marx!</b></i>"

He shrugged off the dressing gown and turned, one arm aloft.

It was me.

The MC bugged out and the ref waved us forward into the middle of the
ring. He launched into his 'I want a good, clean, fight' routine but I
barely heard him.

Anton Marx was me; same hair, same eyes, same physique, same old scars.
Differences though - a couple of scars I didn't have and he looked a bit
older round the eyes. I guessed they'd tried to customise him a bit and
maybe that's how old I should look if it wasn't for all the dermal regen
work I've had.

"...and come out fighting."

We touched gloves and he winked, beating me to it by a fraction. I
turned back to my corner, smiling to myself. If they'd gone to the
trouble of replicating even my minor gestures then I knew exactly what
to expect. 

Usually you go back to your corner, get the gum shield in place, and
tune out whatever final advice and/or encouragement your trainer has to
offer. There's a slight pause while the girl parades around the ring with
the round number board, and then the bell goes. I was ready. Lenny
nodded, satisfied.

Then I stepped through the looking glass.

A small group appeared at our corner, flanked by event security; three
guys and a woman, all in suits. Lenny glanced in the direction I was
looking and his shoulders sagged.

"Ah, goddammit, not now! They promised this wouldn't happen."

One of the men was wearing a boxing commission sash and he motioned to
the timekeeper, who put his hammer down. The steps were still in place
and the woman came up to ring level, motioning me closer so she could
make herself heard over the crowd noise as the obvious delay wasn't
going down well.

She was a tall woman, slender, mid forties maybe, with shoulder length
dark hair and darker eyes. She seemed to take a moment to compose
herself and when she spoke there was a slight tremor in her voice.

"Andrew, I know how inappropriate this is, but your opponent will no
doubt try and distract you during the fight so I decided to tell you
myself."

The woman paused, smiled a hesitant smile - and something about that,
that smile, sparked a flash of memory. I felt like the ground was
opening up beneath me and could only stand and stare at her, speechless.

"I just wanted you to know, Andrew, how proud I am - how proud we all
are - of what you've achieved so far. Whatever happens this evening."

She turned to Lenny, who was standing there, looking as sick as a dog.

"And you're, what, a Lenny?"

He nodded, almost curtsied.

"Ma'am."

"Even for an Alpha this has been a spectacular achievement, far
exceeding anything the Tabula Rasa team anticipated. I know that on
certain levels this is meaningless, but you have our thanks for turning
Andrew into the fighter he is today."

She turned back to me and hesitated, her eyes wet.

"I held you in my arms six years ago, when you first came out of the
tank. Just an unthinking mass of meat, but I could tell, even then, that
you were perfect. You have no genetic flaws, Andrew, none - our finest
creation. I just had to wish you good luck... my son."

The woman stepped down and took my world with her. The crowd was baying
for action and there were only moments before the bell, but I just stood
there, arms by my sides, lost.

Lenny didn't bother slapping me or anything so obvious; he just rubbed
down my face with the towel while rabbiting away <i><b>soto voce</b></i>. 

"Forget her, kid, forget me, forget your past - 'cos you ain't got one.
Just the last six years, everything else is memory implants. But you got
a future. You can stand and fight, or I can throw in the towel and we
walk away. Maybe I made you a boxer, Andy, but you're your own man. Get
it? Whatever happens now is your choice, your decision - I guess it's
what they call 'free will'."

I looked at him like he was some weird example of alien life.

"Lenny? What are-"

"Yeah, yeah, I'm a can. An Alpha. Just like Mutt and Jeff but a ways
smarter. You though, you really are more human than human, and that guy
over there? I guess he's the genetic template they based you on. A real
flesh-and-blood fighter. Hell, two flesh-and-blood fighters, in an
old-school boxing match. It doesn't get more real than that."

He poked me in the chest, bringing me back to the here and now. Lenny
slipped through the ropes while Mutt or Jeff removed the stool. My
trainer hung there a moment, smiling.

"Andy, it's not just your future."

"<i><b>Seconds out. Round one!</b></i>"

The bell rang. The crowd roared. I raised my gloves.

Time to face myself.

[*ITEM] How Manuel Left the Mire

[*AUTHOR] James Branch Cabell
												   
[*BLURB] Cabell was a prolific American fantasy author, whose works most
closely resemble Jack Vance's more recent novels such as Lyonesse. 
This is an excerpt from <b>Figures of Earth</B>.

[*DESCRIPTION] 
<br><br>(Many of Cabell's books are available from gutenberg.org. This extract 
is sourced from there. Cabell (1879-1958) was an interesting character. At one point
in his life, he was expelled from college for homosexuality and it is also rumoured that
Cabell murdered his mother's lover in 1901.)

<p class=drop>They of Poictesme narrate that in the old days when miracles were as
common as fruit pies, young Manuel was a swineherd, living modestly in
attendance upon the miller's pigs. They tell also that Manuel was
content enough: he knew not of the fate which was reserved for him.

Meanwhile in all the environs of Rathgor, and in the thatched villages
of Lower Targamon, he was well liked: and when the young people gathered
in the evening to drink brandy and eat nuts and gingerbread, nobody
danced more merrily than Squinting Manuel. He had a quiet way with the
girls, and with the men a way of solemn, blinking simplicity which
caused the more hasty in judgment to consider him a fool. Then, too,
young Manuel was very often detected smiling sleepily over nothing, and
his gravest care in life appeared to be that figure which Manuel had
made out of marsh clay from the pool of Haranton.

This figure he was continually reshaping and realtering. The figure
stood upon the margin of the pool; and near by were two stones overgrown
with moss, and supporting a cross of old worm-eaten wood, which
commemorated what had been done there.

One day, toward autumn, as Manuel was sitting in this place, and looking
into the deep still water, a stranger came, and he wore a fierce long
sword that interfered deplorably with his walking.

"Now I wonder what it is you find in that dark pool to keep you staring
so?" the stranger asked, first of all.

"I do not very certainly know," replied Manuel "but mistily I seem to
see drowned there the loves and the desires and the adventures I had
when I wore another body than this. For the water of Haranton, I must
tell you, is not like the water of other fountains, and curious dreams
engender in this pool."

"I speak no ill against oneirologya, although broad noon is hardly the
best time for its practise," declared the snub-nosed stranger. "But what
is that thing?" he asked, pointing.

"It is the figure of a man, which I have modeled and re-modeled, sir,
but cannot seem to get exactly to my liking. So it is necessary that I
keep laboring at it until the figure is to my thinking and my desire."

"But, Manuel, what need is there for you to model it at all?"

"Because my mother, sir, was always very anxious for me to make a figure
in the world, and when she lay a-dying I promised her that I would do
so, and then she put a geas upon me to do it."

"Ah, to be sure! but are you certain it was this kind of figure she
meant?"

"Yes, for I have often heard her say that, when I grew up, she wanted me
to make myself a splendid and admirable young man in every respect. So
it is necessary that I make the figure of a young man, for my mother was
not of these parts, but a woman of Ath Cliath, and so she put a geas
upon me--"

"Yes, yes, you had mentioned this geas, and I am wondering what sort of
a something is this geas."

"It is what you might call a bond or an obligation, sir, only it is of
the particularly strong and unreasonable and affirmative and secret sort
which the Virbolg use."

<p class=drop>The stranger now looked from the figure to Manuel, and the stranger
deliberated the question (which later was to puzzle so many people) if
any human being could be as simple as Manuel appeared. Manuel at twenty
was not yet the burly giant he became. But already he was a gigantic and
florid person, so tall that the heads of few men reached to his
shoulder; a person of handsome exterior, high featured and blond, having
a narrow small head, and vivid light blue eyes, and the chest of a
stallion; a person whose left eyebrow had an odd oblique droop, so that
the stupendous boy at his simplest appeared to be winking the
information that he was in jest.

All in all, the stranger found this young swineherd ambiguous; and there
was another curious thing too which the stranger noticed about Manuel.

"Is it on account of this geas," asked the stranger, "that a great lock
has been sheared away from your yellow hair?"

In an instant Manuel's face became dark and wary. "No," he said, "that
has nothing to do with my geas, and we must not talk about that"

"Now you are a queer lad to be having such an obligation upon your head,
and to be having well-nigh half the hair cut away from your head, and to
be having inside your head such notions. And while small harm has ever
come from humoring one's mother, yet I wonder at you, Manuel, that you
should sit here sleeping in the sunlight among your pigs, and be giving
your young time to improbable sculpture and stagnant water, when there
is such a fine adventure awaiting you, and when the Norns are
foretelling such high things about you as they spin the thread of your
living."

"Hah, glory be to God, friend, but what is this adventure?"

"The adventure is that the Count of Arnaye's daughter yonder has been
carried off by a magician, and that the high Count Demetrios offers much
wealth and broad lands, and his daughter's hand in marriage, too, to the
lad that will fetch back this lovely girl."

"I have heard talk of this in the kitchen of Arnaye, where I sometimes
sell them a pig. But what are such matters to a swineherd?"

"My lad, you are to-day a swineherd drowsing in the sun, as yesterday
you were a baby squalling in the cradle, but to-morrow you will be
neither of these if there by any truth whatever in the talking of the
Norns as they gossip at the foot of their ash-tree beside the door of
the Sylan's House."

Manuel appeared to accept the inevitable. He bowed his brightly colored
high head, saying gravely: "All honor be to Urdhr and Verdandi and
Skuld! If I am decreed to be the champion that is to rescue the Count of
Arnaye's daughter, it is ill arguing with the Norns. Come, tell me now,
how do you call this doomed magician, and how does one get to him to
sever his wicked head from his foul body?"

"Men speak of him as Miramon Lluagor, lord of the nine kinds of sleep
and prince of the seven madnesses. He lives in mythic splendor at the
top of the gray mountain called Vraidex, where he contrives all manner
of illusions, and, in particular, designs the dreams of men."

"Yes, in the kitchen of Arnaye, also, such was the report concerning
this Miramon: and not a person in the kitchen denied that this Miramon
is an ugly customer."

"He is the most subtle of magicians. None can withstand him, and nobody
can pass the terrible serpentine designs which Miramon has set to guard
the gray scarps of Vraidex, unless one carries the more terrible sword
Flamberge, which I have here in its blue scabbard."

"Why, then, it is you who must rescue the Count's daughter."

"No, that would not do at all: for there is in the life of a champion
too much of turmoil and of buffetings and murderings to suit me, who am
a peace-loving person. Besides, to the champion who rescues the Lady
Gisle will be given her hand in marriage, and as I have a wife, I know
that to have two wives would lead to twice too much dissension to suit
me, who am a peace-loving person. So I think it is you who had better
take the sword and the adventure."

"Well," Manuel said, "much wealth and broad lands and a lovely wife are
finer things to ward than a parcel of pigs."

<p class=drop>So Manuel girded on the charmed scabbard, and with the charmed sword he
sadly demolished the clay figure he could not get quite right. Then
Manuel sheathed Flamberge, and Manuel cried farewell to the pigs.

"I shall not ever return to you, my pigs, because, at worst, to die
valorously is better than to sleep out one's youth in the sun. A man has
but one life. It is his all. Therefore I now depart from you, my pigs,
to win me a fine wife and much wealth and leisure wherein to discharge
my geas. And when my geas is lifted I shall not come back to you, my
pigs, but I shall travel everywhither, and into the last limits of
earth, so that I may see the ends of this world and may judge them while
my life endures. For after that, they say, I judge not, but am judged:
and a man whose life has gone out of him, my pigs, is not even good
bacon."

"So much rhetoric for the pigs," says the stranger, "is well enough, and
likely to please them. But come, is there not some girl or another to
whom you should be saying good-bye with other things than words?"

"No, at first I thought I would also bid farewell to Suskind, who is
sometimes friendly with me in the twilight wood, but upon reflection it
seems better not to. For Suskind would probably weep, and exact promises
of eternal fidelity, and otherwise dampen the ardor with which I look
toward to-morrow and the winning of the wealthy Count of Arnaye's lovely
daughter."

"Now, to be sure, you are a queer cool candid fellow, you young Manuel,
who will go far, whether for good or evil!"

"I do not know about good or evil. But I am Manuel, and I shall follow
after my own thinking and my own desires."

"And certainly it is no less queer you should be saying that: for, as
everybody knows, that used to be the favorite byword of your namesake
the famous Count Manuel who is so newly dead in Poictesme yonder."

At that the young swineherd nodded, gravely. "I must accept the omen,
sir. For, as I interpret it, my great namesake has courteously made way
for me, in order that I may go far beyond him."

Then Manuel cried farewell and thanks to the mild-mannered, snub-nosed
stranger, and Manuel left the miller's pigs to their own devices by the
pool of Haranton, and Manuel marched away in his rags to meet a fate
that was long talked about.

[*BLURB] Mythaxis goes from strength to strength

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop> Since the last issue, Mythaxis has received 
more that 2500 unique visitors, each of whom visited the site at least twice
on average.

Our profile on the main search engines is also widening to around 2000. Some 
of these are, regrettably, due to a casino spamming hack that was launched on the old 
Mythaxis forum. But, hey, there's no such thing as bad publicity, right?

The <A href=
"http://mythaxis.wordpress.com/mythaxis-magazine/"> 
Mythaxis Blog and Master Index.</A> is also proving popular, visitor numbers 
being swollen by the recent review of William Gibson's Zero History.

Though a few of the writers in Mythaxis have long writing experience, it 
remains a showcase for sf and fantasy writing talent. Two of our younger 
contributors have had their stories picked up and published elsewhere. 

We have six new stories in this edition, together with one very old one.
