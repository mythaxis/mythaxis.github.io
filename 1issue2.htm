<div><i>Dating in the risk-averse age</i>
<p class=drop>I was
sitting at my usual table in Gino's, knocking back a few after a hard
day at the office, when I saw her standing at the bar. A face that could
launch a thousand space shuttles, legs till forever, a real looker any
way you wanted to cut it. Our eyes met across the room, and right off the
bat I could tell she was interested; her eyes were brown but the look
she gave me was green traffic light all the way. I finished my drink and
sauntered over to the bar. <P><div class=pullquote>"What say we get to know each
other a little better while we wait?"</div>I nodded in the general direction of the barman. "Gimme another, Gino."
Playing it cool, making like I hadn't even seen her till I saw her.
While I waited for my drink I turned and shot her a look of my own.
Mouth set straight, one eyebrow raised; tough but tender, a little world
weary. It was a good look, one I'd practised enough to get it down pat.
The hint of a smile creased one corner of her full, pouting lips; it was
encouragement enough to hit her with a line. <P>"Hey, baby, who's your lawyer?" <P>Sure, it was corny, but I could tell she dug it all the same.
Those big, brown eyes walked up and down one last time, then she
replied:  <P>"Arthur Bingham. Bingham, Klein & Bingham."
 
I flipped open my cell, punched speed-dial and waited. Gino set my drink
down on the bar and I tipped him another nod before taking a slug. At
the other end of the line a woman's voice chirped: <P>"Thompson & Sons, Attorneys at Law. How may I direct your call?" <P>"Let me speak to Thompson, and hold on the Sons." Brown Eyes seemed to
get a kick out of that. <i>The London Philharmonic Plays Punk</i> butchered
something by <i>The Clash</i> for a few seconds before another voice cut in: <P>"Bob Thompson." <P>"Bob. Jack Brenner. I need you to file a motion of intent with Bingham,
Klein & Bingham. Client name of ..." <P>"Tabitha Brooks" <P>"You catch that? Yeah, Brooks. Standard searches, full disclosure, usual
terms &amp; conditions apply. Any contractual agreements to be witnessed by
Gino Fiore of Gino's Bar, Grill & Notary Services. Forward all the
paperwork to my cell and give me a call once you're done, okay?" <P>I left Bob to get busy and put in another call. <P>"Peter Briscoe Accountants." <P>"Pete. Jack Brenner. Listen, buddy, could you make my tax returns, bank
statements, insurance coverage and a breakdown of spending habits for
the last five years available to one Tabitha Brooks, through Bingham,
Klein & Bingham, and put in a request for all reciprocal data via the
same? Sooner the better, <i>compadre</i>." <P>"Jack, you sly dog! Consider it done." <P>I rang off and turned back to Tabitha. "What say we get to know each
other a little better while we wait?" I suggested. Fifteen minutes later
we were making pretty good progress.  <P>Her: 2% chance of cardio-vascular
disease, clean for STD's and no insanity or hereditary illness in the
family barring an aunt on the mother's side who had a nervous breakdown
a few years back. Certainly nothing deal-breaking.  <P>Me: 21 million per ml
spermatozoa count, with high percentage scores for normal shape and
rapid forward mobility, 8% body fat, no history of congenital hair loss. <P>We'd just about finished cross-checking medical records through an
independent healthcare service when Tabitha's phone chimed. No doubt her
lawyer ringing in with the verdict. I excused myself and headed for the
john, silently cursing the fact that Bob hadn't got back to me first. I
gave it a couple of minutes before I re-entered the bar, just as Tabitha
was winding up her conversation. It was difficult to read her face, and
I felt my stomach knot as she handed me the cell: <P>"Hello?" <P>"Mr Brenner? Arthur Bingham. I have been instructed by my client to
inform you that you meet with the specified legal, financial and medical
criteria as stipulated in the standard provisions for contracts of this
kind. I am duty bound to mention that there were some questions raised
by your felony / misdemeanour conviction for juvenile theft, but my
client has waived any objection on the grounds that she finds it 'cute',
although obviously not in any legally binding sense. Accordingly, I am
authorised to release her telephone number to your lawyer after the signing
of said contractual agreement in the presence of a licensed notary
public. Good day, sir." <P>
I was walking on air. 
Sensing we were ready to seal the deal, Gino
hustled over to witness the exchange of signatures. I told him to add
his notarisation fee to my tab; I figured even in this day and age women
still went for that chivalrous touch, and Tabitha didn't say anything to
disabuse me of the notion. As she got set to leave the bar, Tabitha
leaned in and gave me a kiss on the cheek; not strictly legal at this
stage of the proceedings, but I wasn't about to call the cops. When she
reached the door she turned and threw another killer look in my
direction: <P>"It was nice meeting you Jack. I hope I'll be hearing from you soon." <P>"Oh, you'll be hearing from me plenty," I replied. <P>I was still staring at the empty doorway when my cell phone began to rumble
its way across the bar. A glance at the caller ID told me it was Bob. <P>"Better late than never, Bobby boy. What's the good word?" <P>"Jack, you're sounding chipper. I guess her people beat me to the punch.
I'm forwarding you my findings as we speak, but here are the edited
highlights. Tabitha Brooks, upscale address in Pasadena, works in the ad
game, low six figures. No arrest record, nothing untoward on the medical
checks, six registered previous relationships.  Shortest was three weeks,
back when she was in college; longest was two years which
ended... eighteen months ago. It all looks pretty rosy from where I'm
sitting. Arty Bingham released her number to me five minutes ago, it's
already been downloaded to your cell. So, you gonna give her a call or
what?" <P>I sighed, and waved Gino over with another shot. <P>"Jesus, I don't know, Bob. Pasadena, you're talking forty-five minutes on
the freeway. I mean, seriously, who needs that kind of hassle?" <P><small>&copy; Callum Graham 2008 All Rights Reserved </small>
