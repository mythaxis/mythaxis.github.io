<div><i>Golf: "I never learned anything from a match that I won."
<small> Bobby Jones </small></i>
<p class=drop>They presented an unusual pair, these
golfers: Professor Edward Latimer, a middle-aged man of medium height,
and his companion, a larger than life young fellow in immaculate golf
apparel whose fluidly swift movements betrayed the fact that he was an
android. <P>"Now, Arthur," began the Professor, "This will be your first ever round
of golf, and we shall score it hole by hole. OK?" <P>"Yes, Professor," said the android - his lips moved, but the voice
seemed to come from his chest, "I have perfected golf on the driving
range you took me to. You told me that I can hit a golf ball very far
and very straight." <P>"Yes, you can, Arthur, but, while it helps to hit a long, straight ball,
there is more to the game than that. The driving range is a flat, open
field. A golf course is not." <P>"I understand." <P>"OK. I'll just drive off." The Professor was a good golfer. He hit his
ball to the corner where the fairway curved gently left - perfect for a
second shot to the green. <P>Arthur smoothly placed the ball on the tee peg, and selected the largest
club from the gleaming cluster of golf clubs in their brand new bag. He
hit the ball in the same direction as the Professor's. It reached the
corner and kept going, without turning, and finished forty yards from
the fairway, in thick grass. <P>"Ah, Arthur, I should have explained. It's much easier to hit a ball
when it's on the fairway." <P>"My ball is closer to the green than yours, Professor." <P>"Yes it is. Let's try to find it." <P>They found the ball, but when Arthur tried to hit it, he managed to
uproot an impressive amount of grass, but the thick stems turned the
head of his club, and the ball didn't make much progress. It took a few
more mighty blows, with collateral damage to the local flora, to get the
ball on the green. <P>Meanwhile, the Professor had reached the green with his second stroke.
Putting was another revelation to Arthur. The putting green at the
driving range had not featured any slopes, ridges or dips. On this real
green, Arthur's putts, driven directly at the hole, veered, overshot,
stopped short, or, due to excess speed, skipped over the hole in an
almost comic fashion, while the Professor's ball fell in the hole at the
second attempt. <P>"My hole, I think," said the Professor. <P>"Certainly, I had sixteen strokes on that hole," agreed Arthur, "I
evidently have much to learn. On this first hole, I learned to keep my
ball on the fairway, even at the sacrifice of distance. Also, I learned
that, in putting, I must calculate the vector of the ball, taking into
account friction, angle and topography." Nevertheless, Arthur sounded
vaguely irritated. Professor Latimer observed a discordant note in his
wonderfully modulated voice. <P>"Well done, Arthur. Next hole." <P>On the second hole, Arthur learned that  fairways, as well as greens,
exhibited uneven topography, that a ball travelled much further downhill
than on the level, and that due to these factors, a golf ball, though it
was hit straight at the green, might arrive in the sand bunker behind
the green.  Further, he discovered that hitting a ball out of a bunker
was not an easy skill. <P>On the third hole, adverse gusts of wind caused Arthur's ball to veer
sharply left, off the fairway. Following the Professor's advice, Arthur
improved his ability to hit a ball out of thick grass by using an
elevated club, bringing it down more vertically on the ball to reduce
the amount of grass the club had to pass through before it reached the
ball. Arthur grumbled at this stage that it had been unfair of the
Professor not to fully brief him before they started. In all his
dealings with Arthur, the Professor had not previously noticed grumbling
as an aspect of Arthur's behaviour. <P>"I'm three holes up," Professor Latimer remarked. "There are fifteen to
go. You have an excellent chance of beating me. You are a fast learner.
Your play is greatly improved." <P>On the fourth hole, Arthur learned that, although the canopy of an oak
tree is ninety percent air, the ten percent of leaves, twigs and small
branches effectively block at least fifty percent of the paths that a
ball might follow through the tree. <P>On the fifth hole, Arthur attempted to reach the green by projecting a
ball at a low angle of incidence across a lake, relying on the skipping
effect to keep it above water. It sank without trace some yards from
the other side. Arthur was heard to complain that Barnes Wallis had some
explaining to do. <P>"Five up, thirteen to play," said the Professor. <P>Hole six, par three, a short drive across a chasm to a small green.
Arthur remarked, with a slight tremor in his voice, that his smallest
pitching iron would be sufficient to reach the green. The Professor
required a six iron, at least four clubs bigger, but his shot arrived
comfortably on the green, and rolled past the pin to the back of the
green. <P>Arthur appeared to take careful note of the range, then whacked his ball
high in the air. The trajectory was perfect, the angle of descent to the
green almost vertical, the terminal velocity extremely high. The ball
entered the surface of the green, and was so plugged that it disappeared
from sight altogether. The Professor noticed that the drizzle which had
begun was actually steaming off Arthur's clothes. He touched the
android, and realised that Arthur was running extremely hot. <P>"Don't worry, Arthur, we are permitted to dig the ball out and repair
the green, without penalty,"  said the Professor. <P>"I am aware of that," replied Arthur, "Having Googled the circumstance
just now." <P>They disinterred the ball, and Arthur putted it straight in the hole. A
birdie, and a win! His first. <P>Score: The Professor - Four up. <P>On the seventh hole, the Professor succeeded in halving the hole, by
playing the ball from the green-side bunker, straight in the hole. <P>"I believe," said Arthur, having apparently made some more internet
searches, "That result is known as a 'golden ferret'. It is considered
'good luck'. I understand that luck is defined as a result which is
unlikely, given the probability of success. So good luck for you, is bad
luck for me." <P>"Very good, Arthur, but I should point out that Gary Player, a famous
golfer, once remarked: 'The more I practice, the luckier I get'." <P>This remark was a mistake. Arthur apparently found the concept extremely
hard to comprehend, and the Professor finally had to concede that the
statement was possibly ironic. Arthur had already been told that, like
most artificial intelligences, he would not be expected to understand
irony. <P>The Professor won the eighth hole, again with a flukish shot. His second
shot, from 150 yards, finished only six inches from the pin. Arthur had
played the hole perfectly, with a very long drive and a magnificent
pitch to the green, but required two putts. <P>The Professor now observed that Arthur had become even hotter. There
were little pinking noises coming from his chest, and a smell of
scorching. "I think, perhaps, Arthur, that we probably ought to stop
now. It's my belief that you are over-heating." <P>Arthur's voice was very hoarse when he replied: "I generate more heat
when my brain is working hard. My temperature at present is within the
maximum permitted. I would like to continue." <P>"I cannot advise it, Arthur. We ought to stop and let you cool down." <P>"But I am losing, Professor. If we stopped now I would be unable to win,
and I think that would be bad for me." <P>The Professor decided at that stage that it would probably be safer to
carry on, but to contrive to let Arthur win, as he seemed to be agitated
by losing. <P>This worked for a while. Arthur's temperature dropped as he won the next
three holes, but on the twelfth, he noticed that the Professor was
missing putts that he would normally have got very easily <P>"Professor. I think that you may be deliberately losing these holes.
That is not in keeping with what I understand to be the spirit of the
game." <P>"Not at all, Arthur, I was just a little pre-occupied with your
temperature. I'll try a little harder." <P>The Professor contrived to touch Arthur's back briefly, and discovered
that he had, indeed, cooled down a great deal. And Arthur then continued
to play very consistently, so that by the beginning of the seventeenth
and penultimate hole, Arthur was actually one hole up. And his voice
had lost that rough edge. <P>Arthur's drive at the seventeenth was long, the trajectory only a few
degrees low, and it was indeed unfortunate that his ball landed in the
brook. <P>"I calculated that very carefully," he complained, "The ball should have
stopped several feet short of the water. The physics was correct, I'm
sure, taking into account club head speed, attack angle, dynamics of a
sphere with dimples in it, viscosity of the air, bounce coefficient of
the fairway, all based on previous observation." <P>He was getting hot again. The Professor said: "The reason, I think, was
that you were teeing off from an uneven surface, so that your left foot
was slightly lower than your right, introducing a slight downward
adjustment to launch angle. Never mind, you can drop your ball on this
bank of the stream and still be on the green for three. I am unlikely to
get there in less because I simply haven't got your power." <P>Arthur was still fuming - literally - when they reached the brook. The
ball was in very shallow water, just covered. Something resembling a
growl issued from him. <P>"Take it easy, Arthur," said the Professor. "You are one up. Even if you
halve the next two holes, you'll still win. Just drop the ball this side
of the water for a one-shot penalty, and hit it to the green." <P>Arthur's grating voice was barely comprehensible: "That will cost me a
shot. I can hit it from the water." <P>"Believe me, Arthur, many fine golfers have come to grief in this
situation. No less a golfer than Tony Lema gave a hint for hitting a
ball out of water." <P>"What was the hint?" <P>"Don't." <P>"Don't what?" <P>"He meant 'don't hit a ball out of water'." <P>Arthur turned his head towards the Professor. Although the expression on
Arthur's face was quite neutral, the silent gaze was somehow
threatening. Arthur chose a club, and stood up to his ankles in the
stream. Steam rose. With a mighty heave, Arthur's club plunged into the
water. A cloud of spray enveloped both of them. Arthur steamed. The
Professor dripped. <P>"Where is the ball?" Arthur croaked, peering up the fairway with his
Zeiss x-eyes. <P>The Professor took a couple of cautious steps backwards before
indicating that the ball was still in the water, about a handsbreadth
from its original position, but in deeper water. <P>Seriously alarming noises were now issuing from Arthur. He erupted from
the stream, stood a moment, then flung the club away. His clothes
smoked, then caught fire. When the clothes had dropped away in burning
shreds and ashes, Arthur's synthetic skin could be seen to be melting,
and metal, circuit boards and cables could be seen. The machine that had
been Arthur simply died before the Professor's eyes, collapsing half
into the water. <P><p class=drop>The University Board of Inquiry convened a few weeks
later.  Professor Edward Latimer stood accused of having negligently
caused a valuable android, the property of the University, to wit:
Arthur, to self-destruct while the Professor was entertaining himself
with a frivolous game. Further, that he had negligently permitted said
Arthur to be out in the rain and to walk in water, promoting further
damage and ingress of foreign bodies. In addition he was to be billed
for one almost-new golf club that was found to be missing from Arthur's
golf bag, a set of brand new golf trousers and a second-hand Tiger Woods
shirt. <P>One particularly meticulous board member was assigned to describing in
detail the damage suffered by Arthur, though he generously discounted
water immersion as a primary cause of breakdown, Arthur having been
built to exacting waterproofing standards. The main point of failure
originated, apparently, in the 'personality' module of the AI processor,
which seemed to have become overheated and overloaded, spreading high
temperatures to all sectors of the android's intellectual functions. <P>The Bursar asked the Professor why he had found it necessary to train
the robot to play golf, when his physical capability and comprehension
of competitive games had already been clearly established by earlier
experiments. <P>"Ah, Bursar, I did not set out to test Arthur's ability to master
physical skills or to use his logical, range-finding and calculation
skills. He did, in fact, perform surprisingly well in those departments.
By the end of the round, he was, technically, a better golfer than 90%
of human golfers. He was winning a game which, at the halfway stage, he
seemed certain to lose. <P>"No. I was seeking to test his ability to cope with frustration, stress
and disappointment. He was subjected to bad luck, unpredictability of
playing conditions, adverse weather, and the possibility of losing a
game that he felt he should, in all justice, have won. <P>"I am sure that the golfing members of the Board would agree that there
is no better test of mental fortitude than the game of golf." <P>Much nodding and murmurs of agreement ensued and Professor Latimer was
exonerated of the main charges, though he was still required to
reimburse the University for the burnt clothing, a missing 7 iron, three
Titleist golf balls and a bag of 8 cm tee pegs. <P>
