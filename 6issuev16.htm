<div align=center><img src="border.jpg"><BR><h2>Border Incident</h2><BR><h3>Gil Williamson</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>The very sinews of commerce are under attack. Run!</i>
<p class=drop>That awful trumpeting from the speakers
happened twice that morning, accompanied by the flashing of orange
strobe lights, but no-one paid any attention because on Tuesdays the
amber alert often triggered and there was never any reason for it that
they'd been able to discover. On Fridays it was the fire alarm. Nobody
did anything about the fire alarm either. It wasn't as if there was a
local fire brigade to call, there hadn't yet actually been a fire in the
building, and the bell usually  stopped after a few minutes. <P>My screen filled with transactions, most of which looked OK, but had
been flagged for attention. <i>Unusual</i>, I thought, but I just went
on
dealing with the suspiciously large number of exceptions:<ul>
<li>Order using cancelled credit card - delete and report source IP
(though it was probably a Chinese proxy);
<li>Order requesting 222 demolition charges (possible triple- or
double-keypress) - demolish the order - no charge  (wry grin) with
query;
<li>Order requesting a out-of-stock (discontinued years ago, never to be
restocked) item -
initiate substitute suggestion response;
<li>Query regarding import licence for AA gun mount to fit Hyundai 88
pickup truck.</ul>Never a dull moment in the Armaments and Military
Vehicle section. <P>I wasn't the only one to notice the sudden rise in bogus transactions.
Spiros in the Pharmaceuticals and Drugs section called out "DDOS
attack!", and a roar of mingled alarm and amusement rose up. <P>We at amazon.dmz.gb were proud to be the sellers of 76% of all goods
bought in the world. Believe it or not, early in the company's life
nearly a century ago, our only products had been books, and we filled
warehouses with stock. It hadn't taken long to convert to the modern
company model, which is a network-connected facility taking orders and
payment for products and placing these orders (having retained a
commission) with suppliers who have their own warehouses and delivery
arrangements. Some products require elaborate permissions, and licences,
and it was our job to facilitate completion via various cut-outs, again
collecting commissions <I>en route</I>. <P>Just when I was about to approve a consignment of  anti-personnel
grenades to Iceland, my screen cleared, to be replaced by Emergency
Protocol B. Simultaneously, the red alert started up. This seldom
happened. We usually gobbled up DDOS attacks and kept going. And I had
noticed that all the orders that got through had looked real and unique.
A typical Denial of Service attack tended to be a flood of
near-identical orders with nonsense items. The front-end filter just
threw them out and we never saw them on the shop floor. It wouldn't have
slowed our system down unless the combined speed of the attackers caused
a bottleneck in the input. Our bandwidth was supposed to be the
biggest on the net. <P>Protocol B required the twenty section heads to  assemble in the
conference room. By the time we reached the conference room, the sirens
had stopped, but the red strobes were still flashing irritatingly. The
big boss, Adrian Dolphgren (called "Adolf" behind his back) started
talking even before the last section leaders had arrived. I was standing
near the door. <P>Jake, the crazy kid from Music, was jabbering like an idiot as usual,
making faces and  staggering around in a comic fashion till Adolf paused
and glared at him. <P>According to Adolf, something very strange was happening this morning.
We were sustaining a very powerful internet attack by unknown persons or
organisations. It was necessary that no panic take place while we await
the end of the surge. Then the door behind Adolf opened, and a man in a
military uniform walked in and shot Adolf with a Remington
Suppressant&trade; SuperTazer (I recognise all the products in my
section). Adolf
fell to the floor of the stage and flopped around like a beached fish. <P>Jake the Comic gave a hysterical giggle, others stood up, or flung
themselves on the floor, I ran out the door into the corridor. There
were uniforms in both directions and a fire door opposite me. I hit the
release bar and tumbled out into the thick rhododendron bush which had
been growing up against the exit for years.<div class=pullquote>Who
<i>are</i> these guys?</div> <P>I would like to pretend I was showing presence of mind, but it was just
panic really. I extracted myself from the bush and ran. I had never been
outside the building in the fresh air before. We were always bussed back
and forth from the hotel along the access road, and it was drummed into
us that no-one was allowed to walk around in the security zone, and
certainly never in the de-militarized zone that surrounded the security
zone. <P>Behind, I heard gunfire and someone running after me, so I kept going
till I hit the razor wire fence, which tore a chunk out of my face and
flung me back to the ground, where Spiros tripped over me and fell
against the barbs too. Neither of us seemed to feel any pain at that
stage. <P>"What the hell was that?" whispered Spiros. <P>"Search me." <P>"Who <i>are</i> these guys?" he persisted. <P>"No idea, but we'd better get moving." <P>"Where to? This fence is right around the building except for the gate
at the access road, and you can bet they've  got <i>that</i> sewn up." <P>"All I can say is that I've seen wild deer inside the wire, and I don't
think Adolf is in the organic venison business. So there must be
breaks." <P>"Into the DMZ?" said Spiros. "Isn't that dangerous?" <P>"More dangerous than these guys in fashionable camouflage with their
barely legal projectile weapons?" <P>"Maybe." <P>"Suit yourself," I suggested, "But I'm looking for a way out of here." I
headed off, following the fence as well as I could, given the density of
the bushes, in a somewhat northerly direction. On Google Maps, for
political reasons, the whole DMZ shows up as a vague blurry area, and
Amazon's British DMZ headquarters, from which we'd just effected a hasty
exit, doesn't appear at all. I could hear Spiros struggling along behind
me. <P>It was easier than I'd hoped. One section of the fence had been
flattened by a falling pine tree. Obviously, fence maintenance was not a
high priority round here, because the fence section had been on the
ground long enough for this year's bracken to grow through it, providing
a cushion across which deer and other animals had trampled a clear path. <P>Fifty years ago, when the DMZ had been established by the United Nations
to separate the combatants, this had all been farmland and National
Park. Now it was secondary temperate forest, vigorous young trees, pine
and birch mostly, growing too closely together, threaded through with
thorny brambles. It was wounding work, and the razor-wire gashes were
soon supplemented by deep scratches. <P>"Where are we going?" asked Spiros. <P>I showed him my OnoTab.  "See! GPS shows us here on the map, in this
blurred area, but, to the east of us, there's a road stopping short of
the DMZ on the Scottish side, and what's probably the same road stopping
short on the English side here, so if we walk east, we should hit this
road, even though it's probably disused, turn right, walk a bit, and
we're back in England." <P>"There'll be a border post." <P>"So? They'll scan your arfid chip, check your visa status, and wave you
through." <P>"I suppose..." <P>I set my tab on id-detect, and waved it over the nape of Spiros's neck.
Nothing. "Oh!" <P>"'s OK. Mine's on my forehead. Don't ask. Born in Igoumenitsa.
Different." <P>Sure enough, scanning his forehead worked, and his ID checked out. The
angry comment on the visa permissions box about us trespassing in the
DMZ was a common factor of our work at Amazon. For tax purposes, the
company had done a deal with the UN, Scotland, and England to operate
inside a compound within the DMZ, but we were constantly badgered by the
robots of the UN border agency. <P>Despite the handy GPS on my tab, I drifted off course, forced by the
thickets of gorse and elder, and by boggy sections in which stagnant
water shone with oily rainbows, to stumble three kilometres in every
other direction for each kilometre gained eastwards. Even then, we
almost missed the roadway. Fifty years of abandonment meant that the
grass, weeds, trees, bushes and weather had turned a highway into a zone
of only slightly less dense vegetation.<div class=pullquote>The men
stood under an automimetic canopy. They didn't look friendly.</div> <P>Fifty-one years ago, before handing the situation to the UN, the US army
had halted the seemingly unstoppable Scottish advance just short of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The final advance of the Scottish army had reached
and passed Hadrian's Wall for most of its length - the traditional
aspiration of Scots since the Romans left in 410 AD. It was the US army,
coming to the rescue of England on behalf of the UN, who established the
DMZ somewhat north of the battle line, but still South of the historical
border between Scotland and England. So, for the last half century, both
Berwick-on-Tweed and Carlisle, previously North of England cities, had
been Scottish. The DMZ, averaging about twenty-five kilometres in width,
comprised mostly moorland, woodland, former farmland and a small
national park. No-one was allowed to live in the DMZ, and entry was
strictly controlled by the UN Peace Keeping Force. There were few
dwellings, and they were all uninhabited. <P>It was, therefore, something of a surprise to us, when passing through a
wooded area where trees arched across the road, to find our way blocked
by what at first seemed a thick grove of rhododendron bushes. On closer
approach, this resolved itself into a barricade manned by several men in
active camouflage battledress. Only their disembodied faces stood out in
view, as their uniforms merged with the background. Their faces, that
is, and the uncamouflaged Barrett 0.3 auto rifles and Hitachi 45 machine
pistols they carried. The background foliage itself turned out to be the
LiveCamo version of the Lexus Stealth 20 main battle tank.  Most of
which high-tech military materiel I knew was exclusively available from
Amazon, so it must have been sold by my section - probably in that
suspicious-looking, yet legal, purchase of equipment by the tiny country
of Andorra, including thousands of automatic rifles and twenty-five
Lexus Stealth 20s. <P>The men stood under an automimetic canopy. They didn't look friendly. <P>"The UN, thank God," said Spiros. <P>"I doubt it. Where's their blue helmets?" <P>The only unarmed one was wearing the same camo as the others, but he
carried an air of authority. "Major Mackenzie," he said, "Who the hell
are you?"  We must have looked a sight with our torn and bloodstained
clothing and the razor wire wounds. <P>Our explanation cut no ice, and we were handled firmly, deprived of our
tabs, phones and G-lenses, given camo gear to wear, and marched under
escort along forest paths, glimpsing camo-suited men, state-of-the-art
covert tents, stealth-equipped vehicles and equipment from time to time.
While an old pale blue Chinook helicopter clattered overhead, we were
told to stand still, then were hurried on, passing along a trench roofed
over with more stealth fabric, forming a makeshift tunnel, the pattern
of leaves on the upper surface trembling in a electronic simulated
breeze. <P><p class=drop>They interviewed me in an underground chamber fitted with
multiple microphones, speakers and screens. As I was pushed roughly in,
I saw my interlocutor, a small, muscular man in khaki casual dress. He
appeared to be smoking an old-fashioned cigarette, the kind with tobacco
in a paper tube. He introduced himself as Major Geddes, Intelligence
Section. He made it clear he was particularly irritated that we'd
been wandering about in the DMZ with live GPS and internet running on my
OnoTab. <P>"I don't suppose the blacks and slants could see you, but Google sure as
hell knew where you were." The 'blacks' and 'slants' he referred to were
presumably the Nigerians and Cambodians of whom the UN Regulatory
Authority (GB DMZ) was currently composed, and who had often been
publicly criticised for slackness. "In any case, you were radiating
infrared. Any UN helicopter should have spotted you right away." <P>I said: "We'd have been grateful. They might have given us a lift out of
the DMZ." <P>"Unlikely. They'd have locked you up for trespass and possible
subversive intent. No-one's allowed in the DMZ. You know that, don't
you?" <P>"It's your fault we were out there. What were you thinking of,
raiding Amazon HQ?" <P>"So you're from Amazon. What made you think it was us that raided you?" <P>"Well it wasn't the UN. And the guys were in uniform, with weapons. I
notice your lot answer the description. Who else?" <P>"I promise you it wasn't us. We've sent a unit to investigate." <P>I said: "All we want to do is get back to England and find out what's
going on with our HQ. What are you doing here anyway? You're not the UN
and this is the DMZ." <P>"Since you are to be our guests, because we can't release you to tell
anyone we're here, I don't suppose it matters. You will very soon guess
that we are units of the Scottish Army. Now, are you American or
Canadian? I can never tell." <P>"American. Working for an American company - Amazon." <P>"And your companion?" <P>"Spiros? Greek, I as far as I know." <P>"Then you are our enemies. Civilians?" <P>"Of course." <div class=pullquote>Our pay reflects the near-monopoly
Amazon enjoys.</div> <P>"Our allies are the United Federation of Europe and also Canada. It was
you Americans who stopped our legitimate conquest of England fifty years
ago, and it is Greece - the other defector from Federated Europe - which
now finances the degenerate state of England." <P>"But we were legitimately working in the DMZ. We have nothing to do with
your international quarrel." <P>"In a sense, you do. Your company has spent most of its life trying to
dodge tax. In this recent deal, the tiny percentage of your gross profit
you pay to England is larger than the microscopic levy you pay to
Scotland, and the pocket change you pay to the UN is even smaller.
Meanwhile, you have contrived to rob both countries of their
industries." <P>"Sorry about that, Major, but we personally had no part in those
negotiations, though I confess our pay reflects the near-monopoly Amazon
enjoys." <P>"Nevertheless, you have seen our presence here. You know, or suspect,
that we have an invasion force concealed here in the DMZ." <P>Up to this point, I had neither known nor suspected any such thing. But
all this camouflage, the tanks, why not? It really was the only thing
that made some kind of sense when I thought about it, however laughable. <P>"Why?" I asked, "Your conflict was a generation ago." <P>"Because invasion and occupation of one country by another is the only
way that the United Kingdom can be restored. England, frankly, hasn't
got the guts. Scotland was always the backbone of the British Army." <P>I was lost for words at what seemed such an unfeasible strategy, but I
didn't want to seem disagreeable, and made a grunt of semi-agreement. <P>Geddes continued: "Anyway, we only have your word that you came from the
Amazon installation, and, in any event, here you stay until we can get
you interned in Jedburgh." <P><p class=drop>The room had a thin green carpet, a dozen folding chairs,
and a framed photo of Scotland's current president, Oliver Pike. I'd
been locked in the underground room for an hour or so when the door
opened and Spiros entered, followed by a trolley with a couple of plates
of porridge and bottles of Olde Highland Spring water - both sustaining
rather than appetising. Spiros had experienced a similar interview to
mine, though he had taken a swing at Geddes when he heard he was to be
interned and had been overpowered by Geddes himself. Shortly thereafter,
the food trolley was removed, and an AVframe was delivered and hung
rather irreverently on the same hook as Oliver Pike, partially covering
his disconcertingly liquid cow-like eyes. <P>We made a few gestures at the AVframe and managed to get the news, but
could not elicit sound above an inaudible whisper, lacking, as we did,
knowledge of the exact series of gestures required. After a headline
story apparently describing a flare-up between New Israel and New
Palestine, there appeared a shaky vid of our Amazon HQ, apparently taken
from somewhere well outside the DMZ using a hand-held telefoto-equipped
phonepad. The vid showed the Amazon sign being torn off the building and
lowered. Next, a new set of letters was being hoisted into position. <P>"Good God!" said Spiros, "It's one of my best suppliers! Bayer, the Euro
Chemical firm. What can they gain by taking us over?" <P>Sure enough, the letters b, a and y were already in place, and an e was
being hoisted up. But the e was fastened in front of the b, and no
further letters were added. <P>Spiros and I spent a frustrating five weeks in the Jedburgh isolation
camp. We were in company with a number of poachers who had made the DMZ
their private estate until they strayed, like us, into a Scottish
headquarters area. There was also a rather cheery group of smugglers who
had been doing good business trading goods by sea between Scotland and
England. They had been intercepted by an ancient Yarrow frigate crewed
by the Scottish National Navy <P>We were released the day the invasion began. <P><p class=drop>My current position at eBay (GB DMZ) Inc. is not
significantly different from my my old one at Amazon, though I'm now in
Power. Turnover isn't as great in my new section, but you don't have to
facilitate many multi-GigaWatt Siemens Nuclear Generators to earn a good
commission. The secret of the takeover was that eBay negotiated a
slightly higher rate of tax with the surrounding countries and the UN,
and, in return, nobody got in their way. So Amazon was squeezed
out, and since the DMZ is no country's sovereign territory, no-one's
going to be prosecuted for the armed attack on Amazon. That's commerce
today. No-one died. Adolf, richly rewarded with a compensation claim, is
my boss again. <P>As everyone knows, the Scottish invasion came to nought; casualties were
few and mostly accidental; no territory was taken. The cries of
"Remember 1314!" were soon stilled. Microsoft Corporation's security
arm, Blackmarch, saw to that, outnumbering, out-manoeuvering and
out-computing the Scottish army. The 'blacks' and 'slants' had not been
totally incompetent. Blackmarch had anticipated the assault using
intelligence supplied by the UN Regulatory Authority and had placed an
invisible and effectively invincible force a few kilometres inside
England. Happily, the bulk of the Scottish invasion force was
subsequently subcontracted to Microsoft, and now works for Blackmarch,
whose presence in troubled areas of the world ensures that global
commerce is never seriously threatened, whatever local rivalries may
arise. <P>
