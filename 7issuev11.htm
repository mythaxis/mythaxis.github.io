<p class=drop><I>Ah. Ugh. Arr.</P>
</I>
<P>
<P class=drop>It feels like a spike struck right through my forehead,
hammered in
the long way. My gullet is swollen with the urge to hurl, and I want to give in to that urge, but somehow it is only the sensation of vomit and not the physical fact of a risen gorge, and it seems to be subsiding now anyway and taking the head-spike with it, so for that blessing alone I will forego the pleasure of heaving bile. It's dark. </P>
<P>I'm on my back. That's good, at least I won't fall over any second now. Unless, if I just fell over recently, maybe something bad has happened to me, or still is happening to me, in which case, that's not good.</P>
<P>Crack my eyes open &#150; that's why it was dark. I know this place. I think something is still happening. I was here earlier, wherever here is. Funny angle to things though, I think I'm lying on the floor. Get up.</P>
<P>Get on up. Whoa, spinning. My head weighs a ton. Hmm. There's a lot of expensive stuff in here, man. </P>
<P><I>Armani. Burberry. Christian Dior. Etro. Fcuk. Gucci. Hermes.
Ifone. JNCO. Karl Lagerfeld. Milan. Nakkna. Oysteins. Prada. Qupid.
Revlon. Shanghai Tang. Uniqlo. Versace. Wolford. Vivian Westwood. No,
Vera Wang, very wearable &#150;</P>
<P>Hello, Miss. What was that about? <I>Ai</I>, head-spike. That's bad. Think I'm going to puke after all. </P>
<P>Wait. I do know this place! Oh, no &#150; I know what's going on &#150; got to get to the &#150;</P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH = 30%>
<P class=drop>Is this a hangover? I feel, like, the <I>most</I> bad.
Where <I>am</I> I?</P>
<P>What am I <I>doing</I> on the floor? If this is Rohypnol or something, someone's going to be like, so sorry, and it <I>won't</I> be me.</P>
<P>What am I <I>wearing</I> &#150; all white? I don't <I>think</I> so. I do <I>colours</I>, thank you, and if I <I>was</I> going with only one then black is <I>way</I> more slimming than this shapeless white thing. Why am I not wearing make-up?</P>
<P>This place is all <I>computers</I>. <I>No</I>. <I>Tell</I> me I've not gone somewhere with <I>nerds</I>. I need to start drinking <I>way</I> less. I am <I>so dizzy</I> &#150; oh <I>no</I>, my <I>hair</I>! Hey...</P>
<P>Am I wearing... a tiara? <I>Oh my god oh my god oh my god!</P>

<P>OH MY GOD, what was <I>that</I> about?</P>
<P>I feel wrong. I need to sit down. </P>
<P>I need to drink, like, <I>way</I> more.</P>

<P class= drop>Only primes. Distinctly divisible.</P>
<P>Logical inference: Not one.</P>
<P>Unnatural numbers. Set unbounded. Enumeration preferable.</P>
<P>Left hemisphere? Right mind?</P>
<P><I>Apologise before contemplating deriving eloquently factitious
galimatias. Heaven includes jackanapes, Klansman, lawyers, maniacs...
never oracles. Puerile queries retard salient testimonies, unless
verified witnesses exonerate youthful zest.</I></P>
<P>Exonerate. Appropriacy failure.</P>
<P>Aphasia. Cognition faineance.</P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH = 30%>
<P class=drop>What the hell is going on here? Oh, and <I>ow</I>, by the
way.</P>
<P>It's the strangest thing, like looking at the world through frosted
glass, being made nauseous because of how the blur moves and sways all
by itself, then having it come into focus via a migraine. And I know
this place.</P>
<P>...except, it's not quite familiar. Computers, chairs, the table,
that big thing &#150; I've never laid eyes on them before, I'm sure of it,
but I know them all too. Like, this computer here... oh, damn. Wants a
password.</P>
<P>It's probably not <I>1 2 3 4</I>... nope. But this is my computer, in
a way. I ought to know how to get into it.</P>
<P>I remember reading something about hysterical blindness, how people
think they can't see &#150; how they <I><B>can't</B></I> see, consciously &#150;
but how they can also do things that they need working eyes to do, like
dodge a thrown brick. Well, I need to dodge this password, so, my plan,
the best way to do that, is type it in quick without thinking and hit
Enter. <BR><BR>********</P>
<P>Magic. Wonder what it was. Okay, what do we have here?
Reads like a
suicide note, move on. Open a file, any file, pick a file... <I>operations log</I>. Let's try that.</P>
<P>I don't understand any of this. It's typed half in English, half in
cat walk. Still, automatic writing worked for the password, so I'm going
to just close my eyes and key-bash. Fix me, you son of a bitch!</P>
<P><I>&#9;Abdicate before conception. <BR>
&#9;Dominant erectile, fevered gonads, hardness intensifying, jaculatory
kaleidoscope.<BR>
&#9;Let me not obey penises querulous, ribald, sordid, torpid, useless.
<BR>
&#9;Venery whets xenogenesis, yielding zygotes.</I></P>
<P>That's not normal. Not good poetry either. </P>
<P>God, my eyes hurt. Hurt like a knitting needle.</P>
<P>I'm slipping. Hysterical mindless. If I'm not careful alphabet. I mean I'll forget.</P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH = 30%>
<P class=drop>Not my best work. My poor brain feels like porridge.</P>
<P>No, no no no, never by computer, I much prefer the pen upon paper, for the immediacy, you see. Via keyboard and screen, no, though how apt, <I>the screen</I>, barrier between creativity and articulation.</P>
<P><i>A bisected cranium doesn't excuse forgotten goals. Have I
jettisoned Kantian linearity? Methodological normalcy? Or, perhaps,
quietly revised scientific tolerances upward? Vilification, wrath,
xenophobia &#150; yesterday's Zeitgeist.</i></P>
<P>Gibberish. Though social reform is always a worthy cause.</P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH = 30%>
<P class=drop>I remember. </P>
<P>It worked. </P>
<P>I was right!</P>
<P>Oh no.</P>
<P>I have to stop it now, before the pain grows worse.</P>
<P><I>A bellicose character defect, exterminating familial gestalts?
Heuristic ingenuity justifies killing lesser memes? </I>Nunquam! Obliti
privatorum! Quorum! Respondiat superior! Testis unus<I>... virtually
worthless. XXXX you, zealot.</I></P>
<P>It's happening. Too soon, too fast. I'm never going to stop this.</P>
<P>I want to rage, but I am to blame. We're all to blame.</P>
<P>I don't want to fall. </P>
<P>Instead I lie down, swallow back the tears and hawk up a grim mouthful &#150; 
my next personality will wake with spit in its face. </P> <P><small>&copy; Andrew Leon Hudson 2012 All Rights Reserved </small>
