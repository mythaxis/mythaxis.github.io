<div><i>Battery life is always going to be a problem.</i>
<p class="drop"> I sidled through the early-evening crowd
patronising Caf&#233; Casablanca in search of the owner, Sully Baker. He was
sitting alone in a side booth, an untouched beer on the table in front
of him. I  tipped my hat. "I'm Rudi Hess. I understand you wanted to see
me, Mister Baker?" <P>Baker was a big guy; bald, heavy across the shoulders, like a boxer gone
to fat. He gestured to the seat opposite. "Call me Sully." <P>I sat down, conscious of his two thick-necked bodyguards regarding me in
a <i>very</i> unfriendly manner. Sully had a lot of enemies and no
friends worth a damn; not exactly a career criminal but someone with a
direct approach to problem solving, as the saying goes. <P>He cracked his knuckles. "So you got my message. The question being,
Mister Private Detective, can you help me?" <P>I frowned. "Well, the idea of someone spiriting away a dozen animatronic
hostess dolls only to return them before dawn the next morning sounds a
bit, ah, convoluted." <P>"Dolls? No, not <i>dolls</i>. These are Uber-Leiben synthetics.  Series
Four, I grant you, but good enough to pass muster." <P>"Androids? You moving into the escort business, Sully?" <P>"Around here? He shrugged, "There's too much competition from cut-price
organic. No, what I need them for is more, ah, cultural. I need them to
form a choir." <P>I blinked. "A choir? As in singing?" <P>"It's for my daughter, Grace. She has this High School talent contest
coming up and wants to wow them with a retro homage to 'Sister Act'. But
for that she needs a gospel choir as backing." <P>"So hire one. That has to be a damn sight less expensive than shelling
out for twelve synthetics, even from an obsolete line." <P>Sully shook his head. "The students aren't allowed any adult assistance
on stage, but I've checked the fine-print and it says nothing about
androids. They can carry a tune and I've hired a choreographer to teach
them the basics." <P>"OK, so what's gone wrong?" <P>"Every morning, despite being left on charge overnight, their power
packs are zapped - and before you ask, the hardware checks out fine. As
it stands we're only getting a few hours' use out of them each day." <P>I stroked my chin, mentally chewing things over. "Uh-huh, so where did
these problem children hail from?" <P>My proto-client looked slightly embarrassed. "A lap-dancing bar in
Foundry. I got a good price on them." He sounded defensive. <P>I sighed. "Oh, I just bet you did. The Series Four have organic brains,
Sully, so when the  new Man Act comes
into force you won't be able to own them at all. Offer them a job,
maybe, but they could just as easy walk away. Face it, you got sold a
pup." <P>Sully shrugged. "The contest takes place well before this misguided
emancipation hits the statute books. Look, I'll pay two thousand if you
can figure out what's going on and put a stop to it. Interested?" <P>"Oh, yeah, I'll take the case, and you can throw in a pair of tickets
for this talent contest as well - I wouldn't miss it for the world. Now,
I suppose you tried keeping your divas under surveillance? Left someone
to watch over them?" <P>"The warehouse is run by my son, Victor, but, yeah, he tried that." <P>"And?" <P>"And nothing. CCTV went on the fritz for no good reason and the night
watchman woke up the next morning unable to remember a damn thing." <P>I frowned. "Drugged?" <P>"Tested clean as a whistle. Same thing happened with <i>two</i> guys
there to keep each other awake." <P>"OK, so you put in cameras across the street covering the doors, you
install motion detectors, you tag the girls with locator beacons. This
isn't rocket science, Sully, I really don't see the problem." <P>Again he sounded defensive. "The problem is Victor. If truth be told,
he's not the sharpest tool in the box and I can't step in with any new
ideas without making him look incompetent." Sully sighed. "Kids, eh?
Look, my daughter steps up on that stage in five days and we haven't
even had a full dress rehearsal yet. What you gonna' do?" <P>I spread my hands. "Just call me Banquo." <P>"Say again?" <P>"The ghost at the feast, Sully, the ghost at the feast." <P><p class=drop>Cutting-edge stealth technology tends to be quirky. For me
that meant a
mimetic camouflage jumpsuit with a <i>serious</i> heat exchange problem,
doubling as my personal sauna. I may have been well-nigh invisible,
squatting in a corner of the partitioned warehouse, but it was a race
between solving the case and stewing in my own sweat. Sully rode
shotgun, in a manner of speaking, via the suit's integral webcam. <P>Actually calling it a 'warehouse' was a misnomer. Where I was hiding had
been kitted out like back-stage at the Moulin Rouge, complete with
wardrobes, dressing tables and illuminated mirrors. Out front was a
full-sized replica of the stage to be used during the talent contest, to
ensure accurate choreography. Sully Baker was pulling out all the stops
for his little girl. <P>The door opened and the 'choir' filed in, shepherded by an effete,
middle-aged guy with bouffant hair. He clapped his hands. "Girls, girls,
settle down. Now, that was fine as far as it goes but if anything we
need a little <i>less</i> bump-and-grind. Yvette, Brandi, you know who
I'm talking about. Now, try and get a good night's rest and we'll try
again first-thing&#133;" He crossed himself, "&#133;God willing." <P>The choreographer flounced out past two of Victor's goons on guard in
the corridor. The door closed and the girls settled down at their
individual dressing tables, talking amongst themselves. I tried to tune
out the chatter as it was uniformly superficial - the Series Four came
with an intellect inhibitor that pretty much guaranteed an 'air-head'
outlook on life. Each chair was fitted with an induction charger so all
the girls had to do was sit on their collective asses for eight hours
and everything would be just peachy. <P>An hour passed, then two. I learned a lot about the latest fashions and
celebrities. I tried not to fidget. My butt got sore. <P>A mobile phone began to ring, the sound coming from a waste bin in the
corner. The girls looked confused. Louise, the only red-head in the
group and the one who seemed to have the most smarts, lifted it out and
answered. "Hello?...Yes, yes, I remember&#133;How much?...I'll ask the
others." She addressed the other girls. "It's Tony-G, who used to own
us. He wants us to work for him tonight and he'll pay the going rate,
plus tips." <P>This provoked a burst of chatter. <P>"Pay us? What do we need money for?"  <P>"We're gonna' be people soon, dumb-ass. We'll need money while we find
jobs." <P>"I don't like Tony-G. He was mean to me." <P>"If we work tonight we'll be tired tomorrow. Mister Locarno shouts at us
if we're tired." <P>"Hush!" Louise glared at them. "It's a one-off and, like Tiffany said,
we're going to need money soon. Do we do this or not?" There were
murmurs of agreement. She nodded and raised the phone. "Tony-G?...Yes,
we'll do it&#133;OK." She hung up. "He'll pick us up out back, straight
away." <P>Well, so far, so obvious - but they were acting like this was their
first time playing hooky, which didn't sit right. I watched as everyone
lifted their purses and Louise opened the door. Instead of being
unconscious the two heavies were on-hand to usher the girls towards the
rear loading bay - as was son and heir Victor himself. <P>Despite what his father thought, Victor was evidently sharp enough to
cut a deal with Tony-G, leasing the girls back to their old owner for a
percentage. So much for supporting his kid sister in her musical debut. <P>The head-up display on the inside of my facepiece registered Sully was
no longer viewing proceedings. This really didn't bode well for Victor
and his crew and I had no wish to face a homicide beef as an accessory
before the fact - or become an inconvenient witness. Although I'd
already earned my fee I decided keeping a lid on things was was the best
way of living long enough to enjoy it.
 
I followed the girls out into the corridor and through the warehouse,
past crates of gin and tins of beans, piled high. Louise was at the rear
of the little procession, shooing them along like a self-appointed
mother hen. <P>Keeping pace pushed my mimetic camouflage to the limit against a
background of patchwork plaster and dilapidated brickwork. I started
casting a flickering shadow which nipped her heels, making Louise glance
over her shoulder - and forcing me to freeze in place like a schoolyard
game of 'Statues'. She was obviously suspicious, but luckily for me
didn't have the time to check things out, and kept moving. I have to
admit that watching the sway of her hips almost made my discomfort
worthwhile - I may be shallow but I know what I like. <P>We reached the loading bay to find Tony-G and one of his pals standing
beside a former school bus, now fitted out as 'a unique mobile
lap-dancing experience'. It said so, right there on the side. <P>Floodlights turned the loading bay bright as day. <P>Victor and his two heavies went for their guns - then thought better of
it as they saw who was standing over by the far wall; Sully Baker and
four of <i>his</i> men - two of whom carried shotguns. <P>The girls squealed and crowded together. Victor looked sick to his
stomach. Tony-G went white in the face, obvious even under the harsh
lighting. I unzipped my jumpsuit with a sigh of relief and a small cloud
of steam. <P>Sully stepped forward, jabbing a finger at his errant offspring. "Not
one word! Not one, you understand? I got a garbage scow out of Miramar
with a pressing need for a new deckhand, and be thankful you're getting
off so lightly." He turned on Tony-G. "And <i>you</i>, you little-" <P>Tony-G held up his hands. "Victor came to <i>me</i>, Sully, honest! OK,
so I short-changed the girls, but a little mind-wipe never hurt anyone,
right? I mean, it's not like they're real people, when you get down to
it." <P>I winced. He was talking about a synaptic manipulator - designed to
selectively remove memories in trauma victims, so they could get on with
their lives. Using it for a blanket 'mind-wipe' each morning was
<i>way</i> beyond dangerous. It was a miracle none of the girls had been
reduced to gibbering idiocy. <P>Sully cracked his knuckles. "I want the takings from those nights you
<i>borrowed</i> my property, right? And if any of them have been damaged
so that they can't sing for my Grace, well, you best find a deep, dark
hole to hide in, Tony. A <i>really</i> deep, dark hole." <P>Tony-G and his pal stumbled over each other in their haste to get
aboard. The bus pulled away. <P>The big man turned to me. He sniffed. "You looking for a job? As in
permanent work." <P>I arched an eyebrow. "Like what?" <P>"Like I need someone to run Victor's end of the operation while he's
cooling his heels on the high seas. A monthly salary and no 'private
enterprise' on the side. You interested?" <P>"Maybe, maybe. One condition though." I pointed at Louise, "I get her,
when she's done singing." <P>Sully laughed. "Yeah, sure, come see me in the morning." My new boss and
his business associates faded into the night, taking Victor with them. <P>The rest of the girls scurried into the warehouse but Louise hung back.
She looked me straight in the eye. "Why me? Or do you get off on the
idea of owning someone?" <P>I grinned. "Why you? Well, you got the looks, the figure and  I bet -
once we yank that intellect inhibitor - the smarts as well. I'm looking
for a personal assistant, not a lap-dancer. An employee, not a piece of
property." <P>"I'll be a free person soon. Free to make my own way in the world."
There was a defiant tilt to her chin I found real fetching. <P>I took her arm and smiled. "Louise, I think this is the beginning of a
beautiful friendship." <P> <P><small>&copy; Martin Clark 2015 All Rights Reserved </small>
