<p class="drop">Going for the cut today.
Fucking terrified.
Gabriel&#146;s got a new cutter setup in his basement, painstakingly
assembled from gomied landfill and parts bought off a Chinese ebay
clone. I&#146;m the guinea pig and I&#146;m shitting it. I can take the pain
(morphine analogues nicked from Mum &#150; <i>de nada</i>) but the bit that
terrifies me is the damage (de-gloving, *shudder*) and the nudity. Not
just the bare surface exposure, but the denuded lack, the comfort
blanket removal that filled me with a lunar dread. No more wazoo
bandwidth netlink, no more Shiny Things&#8482;&nbsp;one-click
consumerism,
no more toggle wanks. There&#146;s an upside though: geoloc nixed and going
dark, the rasp of newly laundered towel on my back, the snap of snaps,
the heft of hand woven broadcloth on my shoulders, the first stubborn
tug of denim over my hips. The real skin awaits.</P>  <P><P><B><small>&lt;anonpost. general&nbsp;broadcast | backchannel. DATESTAMP: 21:22.11.12.47&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">As normal, the tube was late, the TerrorHurtz mid-tunnel
scanners were always going on the fritz and the alert was pegged at
Severe; this meant that the tube door secondary gait scanners were being
extra-anal. As I entered the carriage I got a non-friendly spine tingle
B-Aware ping; like all I&#146;m going to do if I see a unattended package is
huddle as close to it as possible &#150; I cleave to the
red-mist-is-better-than-triple-amputee mindset. I sub-vocalised a
fuck-you at the monitoring child-AI but nothing got as far as my lips &#150;
I may be a dissenter but I&#146;m not a moron.</P> <P>Gabriel&#146;s lockup was in
the old Olympic village and crowd density in the carriage was light. At
this time of night most people are Westbound, heading to central update
zones for mandatory Skin upgrades; you can dodge a few of these a month
but Wednesday attendance was good form, a school night schlep across
town sent good vibes to Whitehall. I shared the ageing, rattling
carriage with only three others. A weary Bangladeshi med-tech out of St.
Thomas&#146;s; he was leaning into the foetid, faux wind at the carriage
interstices, maybe remembering a surgeon&#146;s career in Dhaka. The other
two were interchangeable fifth-gen emo clones; sharing both a smokeless
pipe and earphones &#150; they&#146;ll miss their stop, enjoy, Epping
douchebags.</P>  <P><P><B><small>&lt;anonpost. general&nbsp;broadcast | backchannel. DATESTAMP: 23:04.11.12.47&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">Stratford was delightful as always. I tried to turn left
out of the station but my Skin forced an executive left into Great
Eastern Road, tripling my walk time to Gabriel&#146;s. There&#146;s no way of
knowing if I had just dodged a dirty bomb particulate cloud or if I was
a tiny part of an evacuation modelling exercise, either way it was a
ball ache. It was nearly 2300 by the time I got to the Village. The
place was grebby as always, shuffling late night shoppers slurping down
street noodles and I turned down five Clipper sellers in as many
minutes. The faded, transitory glory in the Village was nearly as bad as
the O2 Arena. Nearly. Eleven billion in old money buys some permanence
but the hectare of previously pretty water park was now a sallow, grim
bog and previously artful poly sun canopies were shredded into
moth-eaten pterodactyl wings that snapped and fluttered in the harsh
December wind that scooted off the Lea Valley marsh.</P> <P>Gabriel&#146;s
lock up was an old storage space in what was originally the Estonian
section of the athletes&#146; accommodation. Thirty cubic metres lined with
grey, fist-pocked plasterboard was my operating theatre for the night.
The roller door death rattled up on under-lubed tracks and Gabriel
greeted me with his standard blanked face.</P>  <P><P><B><small>&lt;anotatepost. closed&nbsp;broadcast | personal&nbsp;FB&nbsp;log. NO&nbsp;DATESTAMP&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">Social historians looking back at the middle of 21C will
perhaps be puzzled by the predominance of starkly non-expressive faces
in
images or video captured in public places.&nbsp;As surveillance
saturation increased from the early 2010s onwards,&nbsp;fuelled&nbsp;by
ever more granular taxing methods and notional terrorism threats, the
general
populace evolved means of reducing their biometric footprint. Gait
modification trusses were at first home-brewed and then Chinese
mass-produced. After hoodies were outlawed, grass roots lecture sessions
on
how to fool facial recognition software grew in popularity, and sign
language jumped the gap from prosthesis to <i>de facto</i> language.
Stegging
became a part of life; we all now ostensibly fulfil the criteria of
optimal citizenry but our visible surfaces are merely a veneer of
adherence to an increasingly arbitrary and hard-to-follow set of
state-mandated&nbsp;behavioural&nbsp;norms.</P> <P>Late in the 30s the
government lost patience with an increasingly wily public and on January
1<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;2040 the Non-optional Monitoring Garb bill was
passed by the incumbent coalition. Stripped of its weasel verbiage and
hand-wringing justification it meant that anyone over the age of
fourteen
was medically fitted with a permanently derma-bonded synthetic skin. The
Skin, as it swiftly became known, could impose any number of centrally
controlled directives and what were euphemistically
called&nbsp;<I>suggestions</I>. The well-planned PR drive that coincided
with the passing of the NMG bill heavily publicised the ostensible
benefits
of such a solution: medical monitoring became the norm (but let&#146;s forget
that waiting lists didn&#146;t get any shorter), voting was instantly polled
via willed electro-dermal response, and crowd control measures could be
imposed with flocking algorithms (no crush injuries...&nbsp;allegedly).
The reality, of course, was different: mandatory curfews, real-time
polygraphic feedback, house arrest with dietary modifiers, tingle
impellers (so called below-pain-threshold behaviour suggestives), and
there was the inevitable commercial wrapper. It didn&#146;t take long
for the Ministry of Justice to realise that a sizeable chunk of
the&nbsp;hallucinogenically&nbsp;large budget deficit could be offset by
selling their captive audience. Spam took on a completely different spin
when delivered in the form of a blood sugar mod that forced a need
for certain endorphin-laced soft drinks and it was suspected that a
pandemic
of&nbsp;excruciating&nbsp;photophobic migraine (and its subsequent
expensive remedy) were the result of similar electrochemical
tinkering.</P> <P>The grass roots response to Skin didn&#146;t take long to
manifest itself. The Cutters broadcast their first Cut on Facebook on
April
1<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;2040. Sofia Bibi became the dissenters&#146; heroine
overnight. Rejecting analgesia and chewing nearly all the way through a
wooden spoon handle in her agony, Sofia endured the ministrations of a
hacked car assembly line robot as it systematically and precisely sliced
through the Skin (and, blithely, her own hide) and shucked her like a
bloody pea. She lived for four days and died coddled in a rough shawl of
home-spun wool. Her
last, croaked words created a slogan for all future
Cutters, &quot;It&#146;s just skin deep, fuckers&quot;.</P> <P>Gabriel was
part of the East London Cutter cell. The Cutting tech has happily
plateaued at a level that means the pain is manageable and survival is
(mostly) guaranteed, but the equipment is deliberately hobbled to ensure
that post-operative healing is imperfect. Cutters want the scarring, it
is a sign
that&nbsp;<I>process</I>&nbsp;was endured. In a world where
almost all sensation, feeling, pain, suffering could be mediated and
ameliorated by the Skin, it became critical to the Cutter movement
that participants suffer for their emancipation. The white heat pain of
the industrial laser scarifying the base level skin is like a re-birth
to the Cutters, self-harm elevated to near-transcendence. There is a
practical downside to Cutting though; as Skin offered an almost perfect
protection against the elements, clothing became relegated to decorative
function, semi-disposable over-garments of questionable EPZ provenance
only partially masking the faux skin tones (five taupe-through-chocolate
shades) of the semi-matt appearance of Skin. Post-Cutting, nudity became
an issue again; proper clothing became a badge of honour amongst the
Cutter cells, with countless cottage industry producing, initially at
least, crude hand woven clothing that nourished a tactility need but
offered little in the way of nuanced tailoring. The holed, ragged
aesthetic satisfied some Cutters who riffed off historical
post-apocalyptical fantasies but for the most part they looked to the
deeper past
for inspiration.</P> <P>The first Cutter shuttle loom in London was
built in 2045 by Gabriel&#146;s Southern cell; operating out of a basement in
a
disused Nando's in Camberwell; this heaving contraption looked like a
Heath Robinson sketch crossed with a miltech medical robot. The first
cloth to come off the loom was a gleaming copper fabric, painstaking
warped from hand-unravelled electrical cable. The Cutters had learned
that the chance of a successful Cutting was greatly enhanced by first
offlining the Skin before the operation. As all Skin was netlinked in
numerous ways, it made a lot of sense to EM shield the patient. This
first cloth-of-gold from the loom formed the basis for a crude but
effective Faraday cage that festooned the Nando's basement with a NASAed
bling.</P>  <P><P><B><small>&lt;anonpost. general&nbsp;broadcast | backchannel. DATESTAMP: 12:13.12.12.47&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">Gabriel&#146;s new rig was very different from the jointed,
articulated octopi that most Cutter cells use. A columnar structure
about 2.5 meters high with a central space just big enough for a person,
close up it looked a little like a highly magnified section of squid
tentacle, with countless very sharp hooks aligned in an endless
spiroform. Later I find out that he took inspiration from ancient
loopwheeler tech, a 20C weaving machine that outputted a seamless torso
garment. Instead of circularly weaving a continuous fabric Gabriel&#146;s
machine does the opposite, each nanonically sharp hook of the Cutter
unweaves a section of Skin, close to the cellular level. Homebuilt tech
is never perfect though and this is why I am busying popping pills and
slapping patches as I shucked my outer tunic. The Skin does not transmit
derma drug patches though so I am forced to apply the morphine analogue
pernineally, not a good look between mates&#133;</P> <P>Gabriel says very
little, there is a little he can offer as solace, he knows it&#146;ll fucking
hurt but he does nod to the neat pile of denim and wool that sits on a
metal folding chair in the corner of the lockup. This is the payoff for
Cutters, the reward for denuding ourselves of cold modern comforts. I
spied the faint striations of loom-woven selvedge denim and the sea
foam bulges of Scottish wool and felt an absurdly childish excitement,
even the boxer shorts on top of the pile seem desperately exotic, with
hand stitched buttons on the crotch placket. Not that I will be able to
wear my new clothes for at least a week, even with black market
re-epithelialisation drugs, I will be a walking, screaming scab for days
to come. Repulsively it will be my own flayed Skin that will remain my
primary garment for the initial healing phase, it will offer the best
protection and least chance for opportunistic infection; I will drag it
on, weeping, like the worst wet bathing costume ever.</P> <P><P><B><small>&lt;Gabrielpost. closed&nbsp;broadcast | personal&nbsp;FB&nbsp;log. DATESTAMP: 12:47.12.12.47&gt;</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">Jonty was braver than most. He shucked his Primarni
eight quid tunic and then only hesitated briefly before climbing into
the cutter on his hands and knees. He snagged his Skin on a lower part
of the chassis, a crappy weld I remember promising myself I'd dremel off
and never did, scoring a painless weld on his shoulder. Under the harsh
sodiums the Skin disappointed me as it always does. Despite the profound
amount of technology crammed (nano-wise and micro-ways) into its 6 mm
dermis, it screamed Gov issue drab; they never did pin down the
self-cleaning routines and dirt that wont wash away
was&nbsp;tattooed&nbsp;into the gross creases under his shoulder blades
and elbows. As he crawled under the lowest excision coil I had to look
away as he exposed his&nbsp;partially&nbsp;seamed&nbsp;faecal&nbsp;flap
and hairless genital pouch, blandly faux skin-pink and curiously more
naked than banal dangling testes would have been. God. Help. Us. He
negotiated the shimmering, hyper-scalpelled edges of the cutting surface
and stood upright, assuming the prescribed Vitruvian pose. He threw me a
terrified affirmative and I threw the knife switch. The current spiked,
the sodiums dimmed to red and I skinned him.</P>  <P><P><B><small>Diary excerpt, hand written in pencil on homemade paper (off white, brownish
stains)</small></B></P>
<p class="drop">I stroked his hair, his real hair. He was asleep at
last; the seventh patch had at last taken the edge off the agony. He lay
on the rug in the front room, a wheezing comma, like he had on winter
evenings when he was a kidder, tired out from footy. He takes up more
room now, and I can't ignore the scabrous black-red stain that has
obliterated the awful floral pattern of the carpet. His escape wardrobe
is still piled neatly by the living room door where he dumped it when he
got back. The front door had slammed open in the small hours, he had
shambled in, swayed up the hallway, scaring me half to death - coal
black eyes had stared out of a red Noh mask, a nightmare made dream; but
I had been ready. </P> <P>I get up to tidy his precious clothes, thick
denim digging comfortingly into the backs of my knees. I used the chair
to spare my spine and as I got up I looked down at my hands, at my own,
older, scars &#150; a silver tracery mapping out a new future for us
both.</P>  <P><small>&copy; Jonathan Joseph 2011 All Rights Reserved </small>
