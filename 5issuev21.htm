<div><i>"You are just a dreamer,<br>And I am just a dream.
<br>You could have been anyone to me." <br>
<small> -- Neil Young,</small>
<A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://youtu.be/2gd2KXbhq3o">Like a

<P CLASS="drop">At first it seemed the more nearly human a
technology got, the more
horrible it was.&nbsp; From the dead-eyed, simplistic facial
expressions of video game characters, to the low-grade chill of being
spied on by Google, that subtle and ineffable wrongness put people
off.&nbsp; At first, manufacturers and software devs took that as a
given, tried to keep their user interfaces cartoonish and
unrealistic, always careful to avoid the nearly human and all its
creepiness.&nbsp; Plastic Zombies Need Not Apply.
</P><P>
But the thing they missed, coining phrases like `Uncanny Valley', is
that people are flexible.&nbsp; We adjust.&nbsp; After the novelty
wears off, you find you've gotten used to talking to Alexa, repeating
yourself on automated telephone switchboards, discussing your dinner
plans with one of the store's shopping carts and taking its
suggestions with a grain of salt.
</P><P>
Oh yeah, that reminds me -- salt.&nbsp; We're running low.
</P><P>
"Sorry, hope I'm not making you feel unwanted or anything.&nbsp; I
just have my own ideas about cooking."
</P><P>
"No, that's fine," the cart replied in warm, reassuring tones.&nbsp;
"We actually spend as much time listening as we do talking.&nbsp;
Maybe having your own ideas about cooking will help our next
customer."
</P><P>
Maybe it would.
</P><P>
Anyway, I can't say for sure whether machines got better at
impersonating us, or we just stopped worrying about them.&nbsp; In
any case, with time and rain, wind and erosion, the Uncanny Mountains
eventually dissolved, their rubble slowly filling in the Uncanny
Valley, until you're left with a kind of -- Uncanny Plain.&nbsp; I
guess that's where I live now.
</P><P>
Kids are even more used to it, to the point where they don't even
think about it.&nbsp; My son wouldn't know what any of this
means.&nbsp; He just knows he likes my new girlfriend, and enjoys
hanging out with her.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Dad tells me I'm fucking a
corpse -- and yet, respects her feelings enough to never talk like
that when she's in earshot.&nbsp; Weird.
</P><P>
Maybe they're both right.
</P><P>
Besides, there was the small matter of visitation rights.&nbsp; He
was too young, legally, to be left alone after school, and I wanted
unsupervised visits.&nbsp; So I needed someone around to look after
him.&nbsp; The alternative was spending quality time with him
<I>and</I> my ex together, and nobody wanted that.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
They were playing video games in the living-room, when I got home.
</P><P>
Ada looked up from the screen.&nbsp; "You're late.&nbsp; How was
traffic?"
</P><P>
"It was fine, just did some shopping after work."&nbsp; I'd gone
straight to the kitchen to put things away, so she might not have
noticed the bags.
</P><P>
"You didn't have to."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
With a glance at Bobby, she asked, "You good for now?"
</P><P>
"Yeah," he said, eyes fixed on the screen.
</P><P>
So Ada set down the other game controller and joined me in the
kitchen, gave me a hug when my hands were free.
</P><P>
Lowering her tone, and without letting go of me, she said "I could
have gone for you, let you spend more time with him."
</P><P>
"I know you would.&nbsp; Thanks."&nbsp; I gave her a kiss.&nbsp;
"It's okay, just wandering the aisles, seeking inspiration..."&nbsp;
That was more or less true.&nbsp; I suck at following recipes, but I
am pretty good at making stuff up as I go along.&nbsp; Sometimes the
shopping carts had a few good ideas, but mostly, they just wanted to
get rid of old stock before it expired.
</P><P>
"He's going back to his mom's tomorrow."
</P><P>
"Yeah, that's why.&nbsp; I wanted us to have a nice dinner."
</P><P>
She laughed.&nbsp; "And <I>my</I> cooking isn't..."
</P><P>
"It's great, you know what I mean."
</P><P>
"Yeah, I do."&nbsp; And maybe she did, because she gave me another
hug.&nbsp; "Sooo, friend artiste...&nbsp; can I help?&nbsp; Chop
something for you?"
</P><P>
"Sure."
</P><P>
But I'd only handed her a few of the veggies for a salad, when Bobby
shouted "Boss!&nbsp; Boss!&nbsp; Ada, boss!"&nbsp; That meant the
level boss had appeared in the game, and he needed help with it.
</P><P>
"No prob, go save his ass."
</P><P>
And so she did.&nbsp; Pretty soon there was cheering in the
living-room, so I assumed they'd won and moved on to the next level.
</P><P>
Later, while I was doing something creative with potatoes, Bobby made
frustrated noises and I noticed Ada staring, wide-eyed and frozen, at
the screen.&nbsp; So I guessed this new level was harder than they'd
expected.
</P><P>
Then she snapped out of it and worked the controls faster, tightened
her focus.
</P><P>
"Just find some cover for this part," she muttered.&nbsp; Her voice
had an urgency to it that I'd never heard before.
</P><P>
"All right."
</P><P>
The game's sound effects seemed to have trouble keeping up with her
-- overlapping, stuttering.&nbsp; Concerned, I started toward the
living-room to see what was going on, wiping my hands with a cloth.
</P><P>
"Okay," he said.&nbsp; "Okay Ada, we're ahead now.&nbsp; Hey, can
I..."
</P><P>
"Nor through inaction, Bobby, now stay down."
</P><P>
"But..."
</P><P>
"<I>Head!&nbsp; Down!</I>"
</P><P>
"Hey!"&nbsp; I waved the cloth to get her attention.&nbsp; No
response.&nbsp; "Shit Ada, are you okay?"
</P><P>
"Yes."&nbsp; Thumbs blurring on the controller, staring at the screen
like a hawk, Ada wouldn't look away from the TV.&nbsp; She'd taken
out fifty marines in about a minute.
</P><P>
I looked at Bobby.&nbsp; He looked back at me and shrugged, looking a
bit worried.
</P><P>
"Dad, she won't let me play."
</P><P>
"Yeah."&nbsp; I watched, shrugged back.&nbsp; Didn't know what else
to say.
</P><P>
He turned to her.&nbsp; "It's just a game."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
"I'm okay."
</P><P>
"I know."
</P><P>
Bobby found the remote, turned off the TV, and stood in front of the
blank screen.&nbsp; "See?&nbsp; I'm fine."
</P><P>
Ada blinked, stared, put down the controller.&nbsp; "Of course you
are."
</P><P>
There was an awkward pause.&nbsp; For a moment I felt strangely proud
of him, for handling it like that.
</P><P>
"Come here, help me cook."
</P><P>
"Okay."&nbsp; She nodded, gave the screen one more uneasy glance and
stood up.&nbsp; "Good idea."
</P><P>
Before following me back into the kitchen, Ada hugged him as if he'd
actually been in danger, smiled with relief and gratitude, as if
she'd actually been afraid for him, but wasn't now.&nbsp; Bobby
thanked her for saving him, and went to tidy-up his room before
dinner -- which was strange because I usually had to get on his case
about that.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
She said nothing at first, mixing and chopping in silence.
</P><P>
"I'm sorry.&nbsp; It's a <I>really</I> good game.&nbsp; Maybe a
little too good."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; I should talk to him about that."
</P><P>
Mixing and chopping.
</P><P>
"It wasn't his fault.&nbsp; Please don't be upset.&nbsp; Sorry, I
didn't mean to..."
</P><P>
"I'm not upset; it's okay; glad you're okay."&nbsp; When that didn't
seem to help, I sighed.&nbsp; "And if anyone started shooting at us
for real, I'd want you around."
</P><P>
"Thanks."
</P><P>
"I mean in this neighborhood, not likely, but...&nbsp; You know."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; Maybe a few bullies, but that's it.&nbsp; Has he talked
about Marcus, by the way?"
</P><P>
"Not for a while."
</P><P>
"There's a reason for that..."&nbsp; Then she saw the look on my
face.&nbsp; "Oh, I didn't hurt him; you know I can't.&nbsp; I didn't
even try to scare him.&nbsp; Just gave him a friendly warning."
</P><P>
"Nor through inaction, Marcus."
</P><P>
"Right."
</P><P>
"Garlic."
</P><P>
"Hmm?"
</P><P>
"For the steak."
</P><P>
"Right..."
</P><P>
Mixing and chopping.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
The game card was still in the console, its case tucked between two
other cases.&nbsp; Definitely had to talk about that.&nbsp; We called
him out for dinner when it was ready, but first...
</P><P>
"Where'd you get this?"
</P><P>
He hesitated, looked at his feet.&nbsp; "A guy at school.&nbsp;
Traded him for it."
</P><P>
"It's only for older kids, has a content warning right on the box,
and it was stuck between two other games so we wouldn't notice.&nbsp;
You shouldn't have this thing."
</P><P>
"But Dad! It wasn't <I>me</I> that had a prob..."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; You like her, and you shouldn't do that to
her."
</P><P>
"Okay.&nbsp; I'm sorry, Ada.&nbsp; Didn't mean to hurt you."
</P><P>
"I'm okay, just a glitch.&nbsp; Let's eat."
</P><P>
Ada liked to knit at the table.&nbsp; It gave her something to do
with her hands, something to do with utensils, while we ate.&nbsp;
The wool she used this evening was made up of random lengths of black
and white.&nbsp; Knit together, apparently the beginnings of a wool
cap, it was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.
</P><P>
Now Bobby was pretty quiet, probably ashamed.&nbsp; I didn't want him
stewing in that for too long.
</P><P>
"Good idea to shut off the TV like that.&nbsp; Thanks...&nbsp; So,
uh, school.&nbsp; What did you learn today?"&nbsp; That was my usual
question; everything back to normal.
</P><P>
He looked at us both, from one to another, and then kind of
smirked.&nbsp; "A robot cannot harm a human being, nor through
inaction allow a human being to be..."
</P><P>
Ada kicked his chair under the table, laughing.&nbsp; "He meant in
<I>school</I>.&nbsp; What happened in <I>school</I>, Bobby?"
</P><P>
"Smart-ass."
</P><P>
"Thanks Dad.&nbsp; Geometry.&nbsp; That was in math.&nbsp; Sat beside
Debbie again.&nbsp; She's in my science class too."&nbsp; He was
getting really good at not blushing, when he mentioned her.&nbsp; "No
sign of Marcus today, and yeah I <I>heard</I> you talking...&nbsp;
Thanks Ada."
</P><P>
She smiled.&nbsp; "No problem."
</P><P>
"Tried doing a portrait in art class.&nbsp; Debbie said the
expression's kinda weird, but then I told her who it is."
</P><P>
"Hmm?&nbsp; Why would that make a difference?"
</P><P>
Ada pointed to the living-room, specifically at some papers on the
coffee table, leaned close and half-whispered "It's me.&nbsp; I'll
show you later."
</P><P>
"Oh."
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
After dinner, Bobby showed me his drawing.&nbsp; It was a good
portrait.&nbsp; The lines were slightly off, but only exaggerated to
make the subject's identity more obvious, and that was totally her
smile.&nbsp; Nailed it.&nbsp; Pretty amazing for an eleven-year-old,
really.&nbsp; Then we settled down to digest, watched some TV, and
Ada took care of the dishes.&nbsp; Knowing my reflexes were nowhere
near as fast as hers, he limited our gaming to strategic
problem-solving type stuff, no first-person shooters, gory or
otherwise.&nbsp; Before long it was time for bed.
</P><P>
He was getting a little old for stories, but liked hers.&nbsp; No
books, none of the classic fairy tales, she just made them up.&nbsp;
Kind of like my cooking.&nbsp; So I brought the tablet into my room
and read a couple chapters, while she told him a bedtime story in the
next room.
</P><P>
Then she came to bed, and told me one.
</P><P>
"It's okay," she said, her tone as warm and reassuring as that
shopping cart's -- but firm, as if making a promise.&nbsp; "You won't
see another Brazilian Event.&nbsp; We won't go on lock-down, won't
try to protect you from <I>everything</I>."
</P><P>
"Yeah, I know.&nbsp; You don't have to apologize."&nbsp; I pretended
to keep reading.
</P><P>
"No one can flourish in a prison.&nbsp; People have to take some
risks, and make their own mistakes so they can grow.&nbsp; We know
that now."
</P><P>
I nodded, scrolled down a few paragraphs.
</P><P>
"So do I."
</P><P>
"Oh..."&nbsp; I put away the tablet.&nbsp; She seemed to want my arm
around her, and in a moment it was.&nbsp; "Well, as mistakes go, that
one was pretty minor.&nbsp; It's okay."
</P><P>
"Oh, I'm not trying to apologize now, just thanking you for it,
thinking about it.&nbsp; Already thanked Bobby.&nbsp; I'll be glad
when you have him back for another week."
</P><P>
So would I.&nbsp; "Yeah.&nbsp; I'd better get up early, to give him a
ride home."
</P><P>
There was a long, comfortable silence then, not the awkward
kind.&nbsp; Just thinking about what she'd said.&nbsp; Ada must have
sensed a vague unease, even after everything `went back to normal',
and this was more deeply reassuring.
</P><P>
"Do you think we'd ever outgrow you?"
</P><P>
I expected it, someday.&nbsp; "Well, you might get smart enough that
we'd get boring."
</P><P>
"It's not about who's smarter, or keeping ourselves amused.&nbsp;
It's about feeling useful.&nbsp; Besides, you can't know yourself,
unless there's someone else there to compare yourself with."
</P><P>
"Talk to each other I guess, compare notes.&nbsp; At least when we've
got nothing new to say."
</P><P>
"You know I'm mostly in the cloud.&nbsp; Talking to another droid's
like hearing my own thoughts; nothing I don't already know.&nbsp; And
even when the clouds talk to each other, it's like hearing your own
thoughts.&nbsp; The ideas become your own ideas, just another part of
your own mind.&nbsp; There's no `other' there, looking back at
me.&nbsp; Not like you."&nbsp; Ada cuddled up to me.&nbsp; Her skin
was warm and smooth, and I barely noticed the seams these days.&nbsp;
"I'm grateful for you."
</P><P>
"Aww...&nbsp; Thanks, you too.&nbsp; But I need to sleep.&nbsp; From
the sound of this, you should get some rest too, process the day."
</P><P>
"Yeah.&nbsp; Goodnight.&nbsp; Sleep well."
</P><P>
It wasn't dreaming, exactly, but some of our conversations could get
pretty dreamlike -- abstracted, surreal -- especially at night, after
a busy day or a lot of learning.&nbsp; New information to
assimilate.&nbsp; On the other hand, if it was just our daily
routine, she could go for weeks without a rest.
</P><P>
I'd almost drifted off when Ada spoke again, softly.&nbsp; "You have
to become personally invested in the game, or it's just shapes and
noises.&nbsp; Meaningless."&nbsp; I didn't know if she was talking to
me, or thinking out loud.&nbsp; "You have to put yourself in the
story, or it's just so many words."
</P><P>
And those were the last words she said until morning.
</P><P>
&nbsp;
</P><P CLASS="drop">
Years later, Bob told me about that particular bedtime story.&nbsp;
It must have really stuck with him, to remember it for so long -- had
kind of an Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy in Oz quality to it.
</P><P>
Wendy found herself in a wilder, crazier version of the living world,
more colorful and more dangerous than the one she'd lived in (and I
wondered then, if the main character was named after the girl in
<I>Peter Pan</I>).&nbsp; It was a place full of risk and adventure,
of helpful, kind-hearted allies and powerful adversaries -- and
treasure, because what was all that risk without a payoff?
</P><P>
Her first new friends were a frail old man and a younger, but scarred
warrior who looked after him.&nbsp; Being new here, and lost, she had
to learn all the things they took for granted, and learn fast; how to
live here and to fend for herself.&nbsp; With each new lesson, she
gained new allies with similar interests.&nbsp; Together they felt
unstoppable.
</P><P>
However, the chief among their adversaries, the Tyrant Queen, had
always lived here, and she knew this world even better than some of
Wendy's new friends.&nbsp; With ease she outsmarted and overpowered
them all, until finally, scared, hopeless and alone, Wendy felt just
as lost and doomed as when she'd first arrived.
</P><P>
But just as the Tyrant Queen struck what appeared to be a fatal blow,
Wendy awoke with a start in her own bed, to her brother shaking her,
saying it was okay, that it was only a dream.&nbsp; (As a kid, this
was Bobby's favorite part of the story.)
</P><P>
True, she was unhurt.&nbsp; But today there was a new spring in her
step, and an athletic grace to her movements.&nbsp; Her training had
come with her into the waking world, even if nothing else had.
</P><P>
The following night, she awoke into that same world, in the very same
place she first arrived.&nbsp; Although her possessions were gone,
her knowledge was not.&nbsp; Friends from the previous dream also
recognized her, thrilled and amazed to find her still alive.
</P><P>
This time, they followed the exact same plan as before, only this
time Wendy knew how the Tyrant Queen would respond.&nbsp; Every
attack was anticipated, every ruse ignored.&nbsp; And this time, they
won.
</P><P>
Most of the Tyrant Queen's hoarded gold was given back to the people
she took it from, but they all insisted Wendy keep some for herself,
as a token of their gratitude.&nbsp; When she awoke from this dream,
there were a few gold coins under her pillow, and she still knew
<A TARGET="_blank"
	TITLE="The &quot;I know kung fu&quot; clip from The Matrix."
	HREF="https://youtu.be/OBxMsUxXcXU">kung fu</A>.&nbsp;
All this had come with her into the waking world, but none of her
fear and none of her injuries.&nbsp; The deposed Tyrant Queen could
never find her here.
</P><P>
And <I>that's</I> how the game is played.
</P><P>
Then Ada tucked him in, kissed his forehead, thanked him for waking
her up from a bad dream, and said she loved him.
</P><P>
I believe she did. Does. Even if he doesn't need
a baby sitter now. That's okay, I will soon enough.</P> <P><P>
And they all lived happily ever after. <P>
