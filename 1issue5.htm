<div><i>Sometimes, a Wall is Necessary</i>
<p class=drop>Sunni Kiesha watched the night that monsters destroyed Tokyo, just
like the rest of the world had watched. Visions of a 1000 monster
movies come to life. She was shocked and appalled, and Sunni had to
admit somewhat fascinated, as millions had died in the short-lived
attack which had become known as The Incursion. Sunni 
was surprised by
how fast the Japanese authorities had reacted, and perhaps a little
shocked, given how little effort they made in saving lives in the
zone. Some even suggested they had acted too quickly as though they
could possibly have been complicit in events. Soldiers had gone in,
while at the same time a frantic wall had been thrown up
around the disaster zone. Sunni had read how a decision was made as to
how things might progress and where a line could be drawn most
productively. She had watched footage of army helicopters dropping
prefabricated partitions into place, the components of a wall, a
proposed last line of defence. Though, in the end, they had never had
to find out whether it would have held. <P><div class=lpullquote>A
grey-skinned shambling form, limping and broken.</div>
Nevertheless, with the incursion ended, they had added to the wall - for
security and containment reasons. Always with the reasoning that they
were never sure what had brought the attack to an end, or what might
trigger a second such event. While in some ways it was justified as a
memorial, the names of the dead who had been identified carved in its
surface, a sight that Sunni longed to see for herself. One successful
shot had been fired; the smallest of monsters had made the furthest
advance, the greater beasts gorging on the population in her wake. A
grey-skinned shambling form, limping and broken. Before any order
could be given a soldier had fired, instinct and training kicking in
during the face of disaster. Her head snapped back, a red circle
formed like some holy mark on her forehead, before her skull
shattered and she died, an aura of blood splashed outward. She had
turned out to be human - Lei Bliley - subject of an experimental
program. A regrettable mistake, the authorities explained, though Sunni
had her doubts. Whether this program Lei had been part of, whatever it
was, was connected to the appearance of the beasts and the death of
the multitude had never been confirmed. But, Sunni had her thoughts,
and there were plenty of theories; people always had theories, and the
TV, the newspapers and the internet had been full of them, even
now, two years later. The correspondence between Lei's death and the ending
of The Incursion was just too great a coincidence. <P>A lucky photographer had caught the image, which had become iconic. He
had been arrested at the time; in the next few days exclusive
interviews were published detailing how badly treated he had been and
Sunni had read them all. But he had sent the image on instantly, and
it was out there, and no amount of
beatings would bring it back. So that moment where the red flower blossomed on Lei's head,
those intense alien red eyes were caught, a snapshot, before there was
nothing left to recognise. That image had spread round the world; it
had been in all the papers. Then it had become a poster, a t-shirt, a stencil for the spray artists on urban streets. Sunni 

was one of so many of her
generation obsessed by Lei, obsessed with The Incursion. The poster of
that shot had been hanging on her wall for so long, that face looking
down on her every night. The Incursion had happened on Sunni's
birthday. She had turned 21 that day, a birthday she would never
forget, as the ripple of news spread and she had taken it all on board. <P>The Japanese government had been desperate to crush all information.
They had even gone so far as to shoot down a press helicopter that had
flown over the zone. Soldiers had stormed the agencies of the major
media corporations. But that was an old fashioned and na&#239;ve response.
The flow of news was instantaneous. A shot taken was a shot
distributed. After the material had been transmitted from the
unfortunate helicopter crew there had  been limited official footage.
But the blogosphere had erupted - instant messaging systems, social
networking, photo hosting - distributed from mobile phones and pocket
computers, sent through a network that had stayed remarkably resilient
even as those on the ground met their demise so soon after contributing to
the documentation that survived them. <P>After Lei had been shot, the event ended and the wall thrown up,
no-one ever went looking for survivors and no emergency aid was ever
delivered. If there was anyone left alive in central Tokyo they were
on their own, this was one of the things which always amazed Sunni,
how could they do nothing? Under a state of emergency, with a
population too shocked to argue, this was just accepted. The
government made it clear in the first, limited, official statement - it
would be impossible to ever count how many people had died, though there 
was no doubt it was in the millions, just as - the spokesperson said - there
were no survivors. There could be no survivors. <P>At last it was clear, mankind was not alone. Quite what the creatures
had been was uncertain - aliens who had stepped through a portal from
some abysmal planet to ours, or Lovecraftian demons who had torn
through the fabric of the dimensions or something else entirely - the
result was the same. We are not alone. Sunni was fired up by this
thought, and she was not alone. Joining message boards which studied
The Incursion, she found plenty of like-minded people. Footage was
posted and collected, everything that they could get from that night.
Then they went further - Lei Bliley became their figurehead - while her
true story remained shrouded by secrets, hackers had penetrated any
information system they could, which primarily lead to a collection of
clips of this strange and lonely woman shambling through the streets
of Tokyo. With time they could even identify those suited men who had
followed her everywhere that she went, keeping at a distance but
always there. As with Lei, information about these men was scarce,
even though names had been found for some of them. <P><p class=drop>Sunni had been saving her money for months now. She was determined to
visit Tokyo. To see the sites of the Incursion for herself. A notion
that wasn't as isolated as one might have suspected in the first days
after the event. The Great Wall of Tokyo had become a major tourist
attraction. Coming up for the second anniversary, coming up
for Sunni's 23rd birthday, she finally had enough money. A lot of people from the board 
were going to be there; at last she was going
to meet her friends. <P>Tonight was the second annual World's End Party Night. Sunni had
obtained a ticket, they all had, and they were all here after months of
planning and organisation. Though Sunni was shy, she was doing her
best to mix, to talk to those people she knew so well from the screen
- but the screen and flesh are such different endeavours. Many of them
were wearing various t-shirts with Lei's face, some were wearing
t-shirts with pictures of the various monsters (they all had their
favourite beasts). Sunni was wearing the souvenir t-shirt that she had
bought from a stall by the Great Wall, where she had gone on the day
that she had arrived in the city. It said in bold letters, and in
different languages: <P><h3>CAUTION: YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE HUMAN ZONE.</h3> <P>Despite the fact that the zone was shut off from the public, the
authorities still accessed it. Studying the zone, trying to learn as
much as they could from what was left, in case there was ever another
attack. But they had also found fragments of alien materials, strange
new metals which had been recreated in small amounts. Somehow brave
souls entered the zone under cover of night, looking for artefacts of
their own that they could sell on the black market. These explorers
were called Stalkers, it was a reference that came from the Russian
novel "A Roadside Picnic", which all the board members had read, and
had later been made into a film named after the explorers, and which the board
members had all seen. They speculated whether the Incursion zone
actually bore any resemblance to what was seen in the film in the same
way in which they speculated about everything else. But they knew it didn't.
The hotels and tourist locations round the wall had viewing platforms
- everyone could see the horrid and brutalised structures that
remained standing. Columns of steel, the shattered remains of
skyscrapers, stumps left standing amongst the ashes. <P>In fact, the club they are in now is one of those that has been built
specially with a view of the zone, one of a number of buildings built
or adapted to take advantage of their location. Some are luxury
hotels, where the suites with a view of the zone demand the highest
price. There is also a rotating tower where, at the top, diners in the
exclusive restaurant spin slowly, each with their own momentary view
of the zone - the late night sittings being most particularly in
demand. This club is a rougher establishment with its electro angst
music playing, pounding dirge music that had become popular in the
wake of The Incursion - electro dance music, stripped and sparse with
an end of the world sentiment, which some described as somewhat
Gothic. Though certainly tickets for entry had not been cheap either,
for all the contrived image of the establishment. Sunni knows all the
tracks, and sings the words to herself, her attention torn between the
sight of everyone dancing and the view of the zone that one can see
through the great windows on that side of the building. At the moment
blasting strobes play across the room and big screens show cut up
mixes of monster footage. Pieces from the real event, mixed with
artistic representations and reinterpretations. Though Sunni knows
that these will shut off when the real show starts. The nightly
spectacle that provides a constant reminder of events past. <P>
Sunni doesn't feel entirely well, if truth be told. For a moment the
lights make her feel dizzy, she blinks and clutches at her necklace.
The alien artefact seems to offer her some kind of reassurance.  <P><p class=drop>The first thing she did when she arrived in the city was to visit the
wall. To see the commemorative plaque, the list of names that had been
accounted for, and the bustle of stalls and stands catering to
tourists. From postcards and t-shirts, to various fast-food stalls
selling noodles to all those who visited. Sunni picked out her
favourite images of post-incursion Tokyo and bought them as postcards to
send to friends back home. She wrote while drinking green tea in the
memorial garden tea rooms. She bought a carton of steaming hot
noodles, ate them with disposable chopsticks while wandering through
the bustle. Here Sunni found a stall claiming to sell genuine alien
artefacts, she didn't believe they were real Stalkers, but the thrill
of possibly being able to buy a genuine alien article was too much for
her to resist. The makeshift stall didn't particularly reassure her,
but she picked a green rock on a string and gave the man her money. No
sooner had she done so than a second man appeared to tell the first
that a police patrol was on its way, and Sunni watched with surprise as
the stall was quickly packed away and the two men retreated in the other
direction. She stuffed her purchase in her pocket and tried to look as
innocent as possible as a group of militaristic officers worked past
her, scanning the market with every step. The illegal nature of the
wares now seemed to be verified, though perhaps that just added to the
theory that she had been ripped off? <P>Visiting Tokyo is a much more intense experience than Sunni had
expected. While the locals seem to go about their lives as normally as
possible, it is hard to deny the psychic imprint that lies on the
city. Sunni feels that she can sense the catastrophic death everywhere
she goes, as if it were a palpable sensation. Being in the city she feels
that she can hear the voices of the dead in her head, a constant and
unsettling presence. She can't sleep properly, fevered dreams wake her
every night; it seems as though her head is full of the words of alien
languages. As she goes round the city the sensation of unease only
increases. Some of them discussed this earlier on in the evening, she is
not the only one to feel this way. But then, as someone says, they have
all done their tours - The Great Wall and associated market, the
memorial gardens, the grave of Lei Bliley and the Museum of Incursion.
The museum documents events - photos of that night, statistics and
displays detailing how many people had died, before and after models
of the city, documentation of the cancer spikes and sicknesses that
affected those in the proximity of the zone on the night of The
Incursion. With such a dreadful history, and with such a sensitivity
to events, how could Sunni not feel an impact? <P><p class=drop>Sunni swears she can hear voices now. A real sensation, clearer than
the spectral impressions she has experienced so far. The screaming of
the dead. The words of that unsettling language that cause such
discomfort. She shivers, reaches out to the glass of the window for
support, its surface cold against the palm of her hands. Music
thunders and pumps, and she feels like her head does as well. Through
it all there is one clear voice, a woman's voice, speaking those
dreadful words. Sunni has this impression, the voice, it belongs to
Lei, it makes no sense, but right now its the only thing that seems to
be logical in any way. Then the music stops. The strobe lights stop.
The screens switch to a live view of the zone. It is time. There is a
buzz of anticipation. This is what people come to Tokyo to see more
than anything. This inexplicable sight. This constant reminder that
has occurred every night since The Incursion. Looking down on the zone
they can see the neon coils of alien tentacles, wraith-like things.
Then the shambling shapes of horrors that tower over the city that
was. Spectres endlessly re-enacting the night the monsters destroyed
Tokyo. Events with a sufficient impact leave their mark on reality,
some say, this is one explanation for ghosts. It is one of the most
prevalent theories as to what happens here every night. The
insubstantial shapes that light up the sky, a show more spectacular
and mind-bending than any special effects studio ever cooked up.
Watching such a spectacle, many are left feeling that it is hard to
believe that the end days are not in fact imminent and that humanity's
days in the cold void of space are not numbered. <P>Sunni, and so many around her, watch this event, startled by the
actuality, even though this is why they are here, now, on the second
anniversary of The Incursion. This is what they have talked about for
so long. This is what they have watched online videos of, now they are
here to see it for themselves. Sunni stands with her mouth open.
People press around her, and she is conscious of them taking pictures,
she is conscious that some of them are talking to her. But dealing
with her own emotions is enough to take up her entire attention. She
is amazed. She is appalled. She is nauseous. There is only one voice
in her head now. <P>Lei blinks again, confused, looking down on the wretched ruin of her
city. Sunni shakes, a cold spasm through her body, feeling disembodied
momentarily, disconnected from herself and detached from the horror.
She touches the necklace round her neck. The strange green rock. <i>What
is this?</i> Lei wonders. Warm in her hand, its surface seemingly
unstable. Sunni turns her back to the outside view, leans back against
the glass, closes her eyes. Sunni is feeling weak, as though her legs
could fail her at any moment. She feels the object at her throat, and
tugs it, breaking the cord. At this moment she is convinced - this is
absolutely an alien artefact she has been sold, that she has been
carrying with her for the last few days. She is too weak to throw it
away, sliding to the floor, wondering how many others in this room
also bought artefacts as souvenirs from unscrupulous stalls by the
wall? <P>Lei looks around the room. The view is confusing. She can see herself.
Lei is standing by the bar. Lei is standing on the dance floor. Lei is
holding Lei's hand. Sunni shudders, <i>what is going on?</i> Lei tells her
not to worry. Lei tells her it will be ok. Lei says that the Chairman
is back, the Chairman has returned to harvest his seed. There are
people in the club screaming. Sunni listens to the voices and tries to
make sense of what is happening, listens to the voice and fails to
comprehend. There are people in the club running for the exits. Sunni
watches those who move, and those like her who are caught up in this
internal dialogue. This time, she tells Sunni, this time there will be
no survivors. And Sunni hears the sound of glass breaking all around
her, as Lei stands and a grotesque tentacle cleaves through the room.  <P><small>&copy; Peter Morrison 2009 All Rights Reserved </small>
