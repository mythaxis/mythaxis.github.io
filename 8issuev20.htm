<div><i><b>"Yet how quickly we could empty purgatory if we but really
wished to."</b><br><small> Saint John Vianney</small><P></i>
<p class="drop">I took one look at R&#233;altin and I was like,
"This is never going to work out." She had never used a Mac before, she
looked perpetually scared, and she must have been about 12 years old. I
knew it was going to take me way longer than usual to explain what we
did, and it was times like that when I seriously questioned the wisdom
of privatizing Purgatory. <P>They had long since privatized Hell, and it
worked out amazingly well in
that, practically overnight, Hell became considerably more hellish under
privatization. Purgatory was a more recent convert to capitalism, and
the results, in my opinion, had been decidedly mixed. But this was what
I had to work with, and I gave it my best. I mean, what else could I
do? <P>My department was more of a Purgatory outreach to the still-living.
You
know when the Bible talks about the quick and the dead? The people we
reached out to were the quick. My agents were tasked with programming
the dreams of the quick, the idea being that if they inwardly digested
the content of these dreams, they would make positive changes to their
lives, changes that would keep them out of Purgatory, which, owing to
budget cuts and certain profit-driven practices, was like the emergency
room at John H. Stroger in Chicago after a full moon on a Saturday
night. <P>What I needed were agents who didn't ask questions, who didn't want to
change the paradigm, but who were happy to crank out product, and our
product was dream content. I suppose I wasn't entirely fair to R&#233;altin
when she showed up on her first day. I had just had to fire an agent who
was constantly questioning our entire mission statement. His name was
Fritz, and he was German with flawless command of English, and his
mentality was completely wrong for the job. <P>"But you don't understand," he said. "I just came from there, and
everyone - I mean everyone - is on drugs. You're simply not going to get
the traditional dream experience in today's brains.  In fact, I would
bet that even if we produced content that was completely
straightforward, it still wouldn't get through to half the people. We
could say, 'Don't take the F train tomorrow because someone will push
you onto the tracks, and we're simply not ready to accommodate you. You
can't think that just because Purgatory is overcrowded that you can skip
line and go straight to Heaven. Seriously: no F train on Thursday.' I
would posit that even if we were that forthright, only half the
end-users would even remember. They simply don't have a chance based on
the outdated content that continues to be produced." <P>He had a point, I guess. Fritz himself was here due to insufficient
dream comprehension. But he refused to understand that Eos, our CEO,
made it clear at last fiscal year's kickoff that we will not be making
changes to the substance of our content. Not in the foreseeable future. <P>With the new girl, I didn't expect her to rush in and try to change
everything the way Fritz did. Frankly, I didn't expect much at all from
such a wisp of a girl. It turned out she wasn't 12, but 22. She just
looked young because she didn't wear makeup. She turned out to be a good
sport too. One of our long-time agents, Janelle, had never encountered
the name R&#233;altin before, and called the girl "Ovaltine" instead. I
tensed up the first time this happened. It wasn't uncommon for new hires
to cry on the job, but R&#233;altin totally took it in her stride.  She even
offered to fetch coffee for Janelle since they were scheduled for breaks
at the same time. <P>Furthermore, it turned out that the reason she looked perpetually scared
was because she had weird eyebrows - the kind that were higher up on the
ends closest to her nose. One day Janelle fixed them for her with an
eyebrow pencil while they were on lunch break and I was like "Oh." <P>That first day, I was pleased to find out that R&#233;altin was Catholic. We
operate on a "points" system here, and Catholics walk in with 12 points
already on their account. It's not that the Big Guy likes Catholics
better, it's just that he understands Catholic guilt in the earthly
realm. Some sects of Jews also come in here with 12 baseline points for
the same reason (and also because I have heard rumors that the Big Guy
loves the sound of Yiddish being spoken by old people). <P>Not everyone who arrives here becomes employed. That was one reason I
felt so bad about having to fire Fritz. When you're employed in
Purgatory, you accrue points at a much faster rate than if you're not
employed. And even so, it takes a long time to accrue the 1,440,000
points you need to, uh, be "promoted" out of here. <P>Why 1,440,000 points? God, it seems, was really rooting for a Base 12
counting system, and he was a little peeved (and a little hurt, to be
honest) when most of humanity went ahead with a Base 10 system. So he
(rather passive-aggressively in my opinion) throws out 12s here and
there (number of disciples, number of tribes of Israel, etc.), and 1200
times 1200 is 1,440,000, so there you go. <P>It didn't take R&#233;altin that long to get the hang of content creation,
and she took to using a Mac right away. I was a little worried her first
few weeks here that she was using entirely too much sex in the content
she was producing, but I couldn't argue with her results: her dream
content stuck with people, and that's what we're after here, sticky
dream content. <P>Her hard work benefited me indirectly as well. I hate to describe it
like this, but similarly to a multi-level marketing program, a small
percentage of R&#233;altin's points floated up to me as her supervisor. This
was another consequence of privatization.  I had never seen someone work
so hard as R&#233;altin, with such fierce concentration. When she was
producing content, she was in her own little bubble, fingers flying,
occasionally biting her lip. <P>Our analytics software indicated that her clients were holding onto
dream content, and some of them had made measurable changes to their
lives that would keep them out of Purgatory, at least for the time
being. At it's simplest, our goal that fiscal year was simply buying
time so we could get more of our residents approved to leave than the
number of people who were arriving. <P>Now, I should explain that Purgatory has very strict policies concerning
fraternizing between management and non-exempt employees, and in light
of this, I waited until her 30-day performance review in which she could
be relieved of her probationary status to talk things over with her. Not
that fraternization would have been a problem, since R&#233;altin's a girl
and I prefer guys, but some of HR and all of the C-suite is
populated by
Greek deities, and they honestly have a hard time comprehending
differences between homosexuality, heterosexuality, pansexuality, etc.
It apparently never occurred to them during their administration, and
those attitudes stuck. Whatever, though. I'm a product of my time and
place, 21st century America. <P><p class=drop>As manager of the English Language desk, most of my
underlings were American, though they do get Brits, Australians, and the
occasional Irish person. And the occasional oddball like Fritz. R&#233;altin,
in my opinion, was proof positive of the reputation the Irish have for
being great storytellers. I wasn&#146;t allowed to look at her intake
records, so I don't know what sent her to Purgatory instead of the other
two options, but I get the impression she missed Heaven by the skin of
her teeth, and that with her work metrics, she would age out in record
time. <P>Like I mentioned before, there was a lot of sex in her dreams, and I
very carefully broached this subject during her performance review.
She
blushed and looked down. "I know," she quietly acknowledged. "It's not
what anyone would expect from looking at me. To tell you the truth, I
died a virgin, though you probably already know that." (I didn't.) <P>"Ultimately, our metrics are concerned with results, and you're getting
results, girlfriend. The only reason it raises eyebrows is because your
effectiveness suggests that we're out of touch with the real world, and
if that's the case, it's something that needs to be addressed by higher
management. Luckily, it's not my job to raise the issue, but I do have
to turn over the analytics every Friday, and they've certainly improved
since you got here, so for that I thank you." <P>Again she blushed and looked down. <P>"Can I ask you - and I only ask out of curiosity - how you came to your
current position?" she said. "They didn't say much about a promotion
track when I got here, so I don't really know how it works." <P>"Well," I said, "We promote from within exclusively. When I was working
the desk just like you are, my supervisor aged out of the system." (Here
I pointed upward to indicate where he went.) "And as the points leader
for the desk it simply became my turn." I shrugged. She nodded. I
wondered whether to further pursue the topic, since it was a slightly
sore point for me. I forged ahead. <P>"Now, you, my dear, are accruing points at a rate we've not seen before.
In fact, there's a decent chance that, at the rate you're going, you
could conceivably age out of the system faster than I will. It's like in
the United States when someone runs for president and wins the popular
vote, but loses the election on account of the Electoral College." <P>Here she looked confused, not being an American. I continued. "I won't
hold that against you, I promise.  But there have been murmurs from
upstairs that the points system may have to be revisited due to your
record-breaking accrual rate. All points information, by the way, is
protected among people of the same level, so the people on the desk
don't know about your &#133; talent. But we are all human, after all, and
rumors have a way of developing. I think it would be best for your
well-being however long your tenure here ends up to avoid drawing
attention to yourself." <P>"That won't be a problem for me," she said, looking down and hooking a
strand of mousy brown hair behind an ear. <P>"I didn't think it would be," I said. "I simply wanted to let you know
the lay of the land, so to speak." <P><p class=drop>R&#233;altin's stats came up at the quarterly department
meeting, and there	
was a palpable air of tension in the room. Some of my fellow department
heads had been at their jobs for a long time, and the idea of some
skinny little Irish girl being on the fast track was threatening. I
tried to make it clear that she was certainly no Prima Donna, just a
hardworking girl who frankly didn't have much of a life outside work,
but I doubt it smoothed many feathers. <P>Proposals were suggested for overhauling the points system, and even
making it retroactive, which I knew would cause huge, huge problems.
Fortunately, floating this proposal up through the layers of management
until it reached Eos for final approval would take a considerable amount
of time. My hope was that R&#233;altin would age out and things would get
back to normal before that could happen. There was every chance that I,
too, would age out by that time, but all I could do was wait and see how
it all shook out.	 <P>Fritz, meanwhile, had contacted me about the possibility of reapplying,
assuring me that he had learned his lesson and would stick to the script
if rehired. It was all a big headache. We were adding staff due to the
continuing influx of people, but the reapplication process was
completely Byzantine, and made for extra work that I frankly didn't have
time for. Still, I neither discouraged nor encouraged Fritz. He was
ambitious, which was good, but I needed to be sure I could keep him
under control. Again, I felt like buying time was my best option. <P>But it turned out, I couldn't buy too much time. I shoveled Fritz's
reapplication papers through the proper channels and kept him posted at
intervals that I believed to be sufficiently informative without being
overly encouraging. It wasn't up to me to approve his rehiring, and I
didn't want to lead the poor guy on. But that had nothing to do with why
I couldn't buy time. Maybe it's because I was getting older and time
felt like it was going by faster, but it was like one day I looked at
the analytics and saw that both R&#233;altin and I were within spitting
distance of 1,440,000 points. <P>The girl kept to her word, never letting on that she was zooming through
the points system. She couldn't replace me unless I aged out of the
system first, but as time moved on, it became clear that she and I would
age out at almost exactly the same time  - maybe even exactly the same
time, with no "almost" about it. <P>It's a bit odd, the way they notify people that they've aged out. I
should explain the architecture in Purgatory a bit. Everyone lives in
single furnished dorm rooms, and everyone has his or her own window. All
the dorms are two stories tall, and we do our best to house people in
dorms that have some familiarity to them based on little details like
baseboards, crown molding or lack thereof, color schemes, etc. All the
dorms have a large common room on the first floor with comfortable
furniture (again, in keeping with the environment from which residents
came), big screen televisions, Netflix, all the major game consoles, a
couple of microwaves - the typical stuff. From this large common room
all individual doors to the dorm rooms are reachable. We tend to put
younger and fitter folks on the second floor, and older, or less mobile
ones on the ground floor. <P>A select group of people in Purgatory are hired as knockers-up, just
like in pre-industrial Britain and Ireland. Their job is to collect the
names and addresses of those who were being promoted at dawn each day,
and walk to their allotted addresses with their short sticks (for
knocking on ground floor windows) and long sticks (for knocking on
second story windows). <P>They used to use bamboo, but in recent years they were able to get these
amazing sticks from Ali Baba that are made from something like graphite.
They're lightweight and very beautiful - dashing, even. <P>Anyway, there are no traditional Gregorian calendars in Purgatory
(though there are fiscal calendars due to privatization, and clocks, for
employment purposes), so I couldn't tell you what day it was, but I
received my knock just as the sun was rising. When I first arrived in
Purgatory I wondered what would happen if an immediate neighbor of mine
received his or her knock and I heard it and thought it was mine. But
later on I learned that the glass used in the windows is slightly warped
in such a way that a knock is only transmitted to the room on which it
is mounted, plus the soundproofing between rooms is remarkably
effective. I believe they use a combination of hay and Styrofoam. <P>So I got my knock, and was pleased to find that my knocker-up was an
affable, one could even say Falstaffian, gentleman named Mick who I knew
from pool tournaments. I was his first stop, as they go alphabetically
and my last name began with "A." Mick was in fine spirits, so I asked
him if I could look at his list. He shrugged, was like, "Not like it's
going to be a secret much longer, I suppose," and handed it over. <P>Of course, I was looking for R&#233;altin's name and there it was. She was
the penultimate name on the list, and by the time we got to her dorm I
was atwitter with excitement. Mick could tell what was going on, sort
of. "So you're sweet on her, are you?" <P>"Well, yes, I suppose I am," I said, not altogether untruthfully. <P>"Here you go then," he said, handing me his long stick and pointing out
her window. "You can do the honors."
 I was surprised. It was probably a breach of protocol, and it's
 possible
it cost Mick points, but I took the long stick from him anyway. <P>She arrived at her window, her mousy hair all askew, shoving her glasses
onto her face. When she saw me she lit up and waved, then raised her
index finger to indicate "one second." She changed into her promotion
gown, ran a comb through her hair, and within a minute she was down on
the sidewalk with the rest of us.  <P>Mick pronounced us the happiest group he'd had in a long time, and that
was saying something, considering where we were going. I asked him if
people grew wistful of Purgatory, despite knowing where they were
headed, and he said they did. People are great at making homes wherever
they happen to be thrown, and even moving on to something infinitely
better could be bittersweet.	 <P>When we reached the transit point, we all signed our names to the
register, and everyone was handed his or her own iPod that had been
pre-loaded with every song ever recorded in every language. What can I
say? Steve Jobs spent some time here and we took advantage, developing a
special employment category just for him. The transit cars were very
much like train cars, with all of Mick's group occupying one, and other
cars reserved for the groups of other knockers-up. It was very lush,
with Memory Foam seats, an open bar, and an Automat in case anyone got
hungry. <P>R&#233;altin and I sat together, and as soon as we left the station, she
reached into her bra and pulled out a headphone splitter. <P>"They thought I was crazy when I bought this last year," she lilted.
"The clerk told me he had only ever sold one other, and it was to a set
of identical twins who had entered Purgatory at the same time. I told
him, 'No, this is great craic. You'll see.' And here we are." She
plugged it into her iPod and plugged both our earbuds into it. <P>Not long after, an attendant came through to collect eyeglasses, hearing
aids, false teeth, artificial limbs - basically any human-related aids
to living. In Purgatory, you keep your human flaws and many of your
human pains (aside from the existential angst associated with just plain
living). It's been that way since before privatization, by the way. But,
of course, we were in the process of losing those flaws, and so all the
tools and impedimenta were put into a recycling program. R&#233;altin tossed
her eyeglasses into the bin. I had a pacemaker and asked the attendant
what I needed to do about that, and she told me there was a special
booth I would go to at the other end of the line that would take care of
that, "painlessly," she added.	 <P>Our journey didn't seem to take much time, but I know it took several
songs' worth, because R&#233;altin DJ'd our entire trip. As the transporter
started to slow down, here we were, this fat gay American dude with a
pacemaker sharing an iPod with a wispy little Irish girl, who by that
time was thoroughly engrossed in rapping along with Jay-Z on "A Star is
Born."  We were reaching the end of our journey as she was mouthing
"They had a hell of a run, standing ovay!" So it was quite appropriate. <P><p class=drop>Things are different here. I wondered if we would remember
Purgatory,
and I was assured up front that we would. In fact, once we got here it
wasn't a matter of "having" knowledge, but rather of "being" knowledge,
all of it, from all of time, past, present, and future. And once you are
knowledge - all knowledge - there is no more judgment. You can remember
judging, but you can even look at that with detachment, since it is,
after all, part of the sum total of knowledge that you are incorporated
into. <P>Once you're here, there's no looking up people to find out if they're
here. You just know. I knew my mother was here without having asked, for
example. And I also knew that her soul had been cleansed for every ugly
word she ever said to me, for kicking me out of the house when I was 17.
It didn't matter. We had all crossed the so-called River Jordan, entered
the collective unconscious, become one with the universe. We were even
at one with the people back on earth, though they wouldn't know that
until they got here. <P>But I also knew that there's something of yourself that you retain for
eternity. Some natural predilection for that which makes you you.
R&#233;altin is my neighbor now, and could be for all eternity. And it's
purely a construct, because even if we didn't live next door to each
other, we would be just as "together" since we're part of everything
now, including each other. But it's nice. We don't need the iPod now,
because we're part of it all, it's all there, all the time, on demand.
How strange and unpredictable where life (and death!) takes you. Where
the sticky dreams can ultimately lead you.
