<p class="drop">We find her in the Gutters. <P>It&#146;s like a bad corporate dystopian film noir: the kind they used to
scare us with right in the childhood. My partner&#146;s still gawking on this
&#133; travesty in front of us as I&#146;m already at her side. <P>I can tell that it&#146;s bad. Not terminal, but bad. She&#146;s in a plastered
pink latex dress and she&#146;s soaked. Why is it always raining in these
fucking stories that are always real life? Her leg is not supposed to be
bending that way. <P>But her head. Goddammit all, they did a number on her face. It's all
tangled dark hair, blood, and metal. Either they mashed her with a chunk
of stainless steel or she&#146;s a girl that really likes her metal &#133; <P>&#147;Damn,&#148; my partner says, kneeling beside me on the wet concrete, &#147;Is she
even&#150;&#148; <P>There&#146;s this low whine. At first, I think it&#146;s interference. The
advert-murals in the Gutters never really work all that great to begin
with and with all the hack-jobs and shattered plasta-glass around it&#146;s
probably a miracle that they give us this much light. <P>It takes only a moment to realize that the sound&#146;s coming from her. My
partner&#146;s better at following orders than dealing with people. I make my
decision quickly. &#147;You,&#148; I tell my partner, &#147;check around for some ID.
I&#146;ll talk to her. Go.&#148; <P>I&#146;m not paying attention to him anymore. I&#146;m placing her wrist in my
hand to get a feel for her pulse, &#147;Miss? Miss, stay awake please. Miss,
I need you to tell me what happened here?&#148; <P>She needs to stay conscious. I see one blue sliver open on
the most battered part of her face. It's unfocused and muddled with
fear. I take her hand and I squeeze it. <P>&#147;Hey,&#148; my partner calls out, &#147;I found a purse. Credits are still
in there. Damned if I know why they
didn&#146;t take it. Says she&#146;s a waitress nearby on the Docks.&#148; <P>&#147;That&#146;s not far from the Gutters,&#148; I mutter to myself and her: to keep
her alert. <P>I want to ask her what in the hell she was thinking being down in the
Gutters at night. Not even the cops come down here at this time: not if
they knew what was good for them. I want to shout at her, but it&#146;s not
her fault. She doesn't deserve this. And looking at the injuries and
knowing no-one took her credit chips, this looks very fucking personal. <P>And that&#146;s enough for me. <P>&#147;Call it in,&#148; I tell my partner, still trying to see if she&#146;s breathing
or not, &#147;Tell the Shelter we need some back-up and a forensic. And a
Talker,&#148; I add, &#147;definitely a Talker.&#148; <P>My partner groans, &#147;A forensic&#146;s probably not gonna help. Cheapest
scanners in the world, man. Those fuckers are probably squeaky-clean and
long gone by now.&#148; <P>&#147;Tell them to bring it anyway,&#148; I still can&#146;t find her pulse and the
ground seems to be thrumming through me. There must be
a generator nearby. <P>&#147;Man, we&#146;re just a Volunteer outfit. Neighbourhood Eye. All that, you
know? That&#146;s for the police to&#150;&#148; <P>&#147;The only thing the City&#146;s given us Gutter-trash is glow-in-the-dark
advert night-lights,&#148; I&#146;m beginning to remember that I&#146;m pissed off and
that my partner&#146;s a bit of an asshole, &#147;The Guilds will pay for our
lights, but not our security problems. Scan her ID number through, if
you need something useful to do.&#148; <P>I&#146;m not surprised he didn&#146;t do that. He doesn&#146;t think too hard. Good for
the gun in his pocket &#150; and not the non-existent one he tells the ladies
about &#150; but definitely not for the details. But if she&#146;s not from around
here, she could be in another district and out of jurisdiction. The
police there might be a better help to her if we scan her number. Maybe
she didn&#146;t have time to tap that ID before &#133; <P>&#147;Um, man?&#148; <P>I see it before he does. She is moaning quietly again and shifting her
head. <P>&#147;Miss &#133; don&#146;t move.. We&#146;re &#133; we&#146;re getting help for you &#133;&#148; <P>&#147;Man, the number says&#150;&#148; <P>&#147;I know what the fucking number says, you dumb fuck!&#148; I&#146;m snarling at
him and looking at the side of her face she just showed me, &#147;Please,
just shut up. Shut&#150;the fuck&#150;up for a bit.&#148; <P>I'm staring at a mass of burning circuits and mangled wires underneath
tatters of skin. I thought it was just the blood that made that side of
her head glitter like that. Good old Heinlein would have called her an
Artifact. I call this whole situation a piece of work. <P>I see a dark stream of waste flowing out of her mini-skirt. It smells
like liquid rubber and she's whimpering. When she speaks, her voice is
all static-filled pain. <P>&#147;Please &#133;&#148; her voice reverbs, and I wonder if it's because her cords are
crushed or if it&#146;s that half the skin on her face is gone, &#147;No &#133; I
won&#146;t. I won&#146;t &#133;&#148; <P>&#147;Guy,&#148; my partner&#146;s pulling at my shoulder, &#147;She&#146;s a Number. Bought
herself out of the Slippery Diner. Not our problem.&#148; <P>&#147;Did you call up the Shelter?&#148; I realize the thrumming beneath me is the
hum of her cardiac generator flowing power into her body. I&#146;m taking off
my jacket and putting it over her body. <P>&#147;Yeah, but we don&#146;t have time for this. She&#146;s just a &#133;&#148; <P>&#147;Just a what?&#148; I&#146;m not looking at him because I know I&#146;m going to punch
him if I look at him, &#147;A Skin-Job? Is that it? Tell me, man, do you
think you&#146;d still look pretty if it was you without your skin?&#148; <P>He says nothing. His cowardice saves him from a decking. <P>&#147;Call them the fuck up again,&#148; I say in a much quieter voice, &#147;Tell them
to bring one of those Artificers. I know we have them. So call. Now.&#148; <P>He shrugs. I stare him down and he walks off. It's almost a good thing
we're in the Gutters. There are none of them damn Registration Officers
here to really cause trouble. Number-watching, my ass. Those
stormtroopers make my partner look like freaking Archie Bunker. <P>
&#147;H-help &#133;&#148; <P>She&#146;s looking up at me. Her one blue eye is pleading. My hand is still
in hers. She&#146;s cold to the touch. I know enough to figure that it&#146;s a
circulation problem. She might have been warm any other time but this. I
grip her hand again. <P>&#147;Help&#146;s on the way, miss,&#148; I tell her, &#147;You&#146;re a waitress at the Slippery?&#148; <P>She makes a sound almost like a yes. <P>&#147;I&#146;ve not been there a while now,&#148; I see the lights of the crew coming
in the dark, &#147;best sushi rolls ever.&#148; <P>I might have even seen her there. She could&#146;ve served me and I would
never know it. She looked like she was somewhere else: hoping for a
night on the town. I might never know what happened. And no one ever
would if we hadn&#146;t got here. She would have been just another lost
Number in the Gutter trash. <P>&#147;Don&#146;t worry, miss. We&#146;re part of the Gutter Shelter. We don&#146;t leave
anyone behind. Anyone.&#148; <P>She looks up at me. The gears in the side of her face make a whirring
sound. The flesh part of her face that&#146;s not fucked up is scrunching.
The metal part of her is shifting. A tear comes out of her one blue eye.
I realize she&#146;s trying to smile, or cry. <P>It&#146;s breaking my fucking heart. <P>I realize, later, when they&#146;ve taken her away and my fingers hurt that
she&#146;d actually been gripping my hand too. <P><small>&copy; Matthew Kirshenblatt 2013 All Rights Reserved </small>
