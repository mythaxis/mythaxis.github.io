<div><i>"There is no such thing as Accident; it is Destiny misnamed."<br />
<small>Cherth Pranswat of Sirisulsor, Omnant Exemplary of the Order of Seven
Streams.</small></i>
<p class="drop">Snoak was on the whole a secular community, benignly tolerant of visitors
professing beliefs based on ancient texts or exclusive revelations of the
divine, provided that such visitors did not disturb the peace by seeking to
convert the unenlightened. Nonetheless some of Snoak&#146;s own citizens still
found comfort in practices many would think superstitious.
</p>
<p>
The redoubtable Ebby Blates, gossip-in-chief at the Multimart, drew
confidence from her studiously embellished hats; objects of ineffable power
and sometimes terrifying beauty. Equally garrulous though less conspicuous,
Ched Pellet, a stalwart employee at Greeming &amp; Trulph, would eat fish
only when the moon was full. Even Tedor Safra, creator of piquant
delicacies at The Cylinder in Gropp&#146;s Market, appeared to resort to prayer
before allowing any of his distinctive dishes to be presented to a
customer, although it was suspected that he was silently repeating a mantra
learned from his fierce maternal grandmother concerning the virtues of
parsimony.
</p>
<p>
At the podport there was a brief flurry of excitement among the late
morning shift, when a chartered overnight pod from Sirisulsor bound for
Meheric reported a steering malfunction and was granted an emergency
landing. While the pilot went in search of a mechanic the
resplendently-robed passengers were safely conducted to a private lounge.
</p>
<p>
Cherth Pranswat of Sirisulsor, Omnant Exemplary of the Order of Seven
Streams, regarded their unintended arrival in Snoak as a happy accident.
They were now bound to miss an international conference on Preparedness,
but he did not appear to be disconcerted. His characteristic air of amused
composure was the product of years of meditative discipline. With quiet
efficiency he contacted the organizers in Meheric to express his apologies
and then arranged for their return home by public nightpod. There would be
time for a little educational exploration. The Omnant and his entourage of
ten Ferren wore the traditional grey-lined robes which on their outer
surface bore a bright embroidered design of gold lightning above the seven
interwoven streams of silver and blue. As it would be unseemly to draw
attention to themselves he advised that they follow his example by wearing
their robes reversed with the hoods down. Having made use of the podport&#146;s
hygiene facilities they set out to spend the intervening hours absorbing
the ambiance of Snoak.
</p>
<p>
&#147;For every place harbours its own peculiar brightness and its own
particular breath,&#148; the Omnant assured them.
</p>
<p>
There was indeed a certain indefinable brightness about Snoak City,
imparted to some extent by the reflective qualities of the local stone,
which was rich in silicates, and by the sunlight glancing off the Stirrow
and weaving fluid patterns on the flanks of riverside buildings. Other
contributing factors were landmarks such as Quanderpyre Tower, with its
unavoidable flamingo pinkness, and the prismatic globe to the east which
now hung over the art market. These remained luminous after the sun had
set, adding their contrasting individuality to the chains of light along
street and river, the glow above Praspafole Stadium and the softer
illumination of Garrible Park.
</p>
<p>
Snoak&#146;s exudations were multiple, and there was no specific area, other
than possibly far above on a still day, where these might conveniently
combine for the benefit of anyone interested in identifying what might be
called its unique breath. Some of the contributory elements were distinctly
unpleasant. A stagnant miasma still hovered over Gunder&#146;s Bight, despite
the clean-up programme which had received official approval after months of
petitioning. Drainage from the nearby glassworks remained suspect, while
the heady redolence of fermentation continued to flow from the brewery.
Elsewhere one might encounter whiffs of hot glue and wood shavings, the
tang of caramelizing onions, a wave of chlorophyll from mown grass mingling
with complex floral scents from park and garden, oddly obscure chemical
odours seeping faintly from the Neutrilax factory.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining a respectfully protective formation around the Omnant the
grey-cloaked band slowly ventured south towards Central, following signs
for crossing the river as pedestrians by the Hubbin Street tunnel. To most
of the acolytes this was a new and fearful experience, and before
descending into the comparative gloom of the stripway they turned to the
Omnant for reassurance.
</p>
<p>
&#147;The darkest night is no more than a passing shadow,&#148; he told them.
</p>
<p class=drop>Some minutes later they emerged into the bustle of streets surrounding the
city&#146;s administrative hub. Accustomed to a contemplative lifestyle, the
acolytes shrank like startled tortoises into the anonymity of their robes
as a bewildering stampede of noisy citizens swept past them. Cherth
Pranswat stood with folded arms, waiting while his less experienced
companions tried to adjust to the perfectly normal commotion of lunchtime
in Snoak City. They would need to look for a more private space.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Be calm, Ferren,&#148; counselled the Omnant. &#147;Though they seem like bats in a
blizzard these good people are our unwitting hosts. There are many pathways
to understanding, but we must first unlock the gates of fortitude.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Ten heads bowed, acknowledging the probable wisdom of this advice.
</p>
<p>
In a self-effacing grey huddle the group gradually made its way round the
octagonal perimeter of Central, through the cacophony of the street market.
Among the stallholders was Pindo Arrik, whose many varieties of exotic nuts
were set out in precise pyramidal towers which he rebuilt between his
infrequent sales. The sales were infrequent partly because his prices were
too high, but also because potential customers were reluctant to disturb
the geometry of the merchandise. He kept a watchful eye on passers-by, and
had seen this somewhat unusual group approaching. They appeared to be
wearing dressing-gowns. He noticed that they seemed to show little or no
interest in any of the wares displayed on either side. They glided by his
own stall in a silent phalanx, only the flicking of their eyes attesting
that they were observing their surroundings. He watched them move past the
fruits and herbs and on towards the florists and the bric-a-brac
vendors. Pindo
returned his attention to his stall, where he was aghast to find that all
but one of his meticulously built pyramids had unaccountably collapsed into
crude random heaps.
</p>
<p>
They carried on past the crowded entrance to the auditorium where a small
contingent of shy young autograph-hunters mistook them for the itinerant
singing troupe Wohoko. The subsequent ripple of excitement spread through
the queue, which had been waiting, admittedly without great enthusiasm, for
an amateur recital on a flatwater harp. The queue fragmented into
argumentative clusters of Wohoko fans and those with more liberal tastes.
There were minor scuffles, quelled by the vigilant intervention of CenSec.
</p>
<p class=drop>Meanwhile, Praswat&#146;s posse had reached the relative tranquillity of
Fountain Square. The long ornamental benches around the periphery were
already occupied by people lunching alfresco, so they were obliged to find
room on the steps leading up to the fountain, where a fine cold spray
wafted over them at the whim of the wind. In an unspoken adherence to their
principles they each strove to find this experience rewarding, an effort
made more difficult as the day was not particularly warm, and with their
heads uncovered they suffered the additional discomfort of moisture slowly
matting their hair and trickling down necks and faces.
</p>
<p>
They sat quietly under this intermittent mizzle, ignored by the populace
until one inquisitive child, a boy of about five, intrigued by this
incongruous cluster of grey strangers on the fountain steps, ran up to
stare at them.
</p>
<p>
&#147;What you doin&#146;?&#148;
</p>
<p>
Fer Cargat, the nearest of the damp acolytes, looked down at him kindly.
&#147;We are visitors to Snoak from quite far away. Sirisulsor,&#148; he explained.
</p>
<p>
A look of indignation wrinkled the boy&#146;s face before he turned and rushed
back across the square, asserting breathlessly: &#147;I&#146;m not, I&#146;m not, I&#146;m NOT
a silly saucer!&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;A fledgling&#146;s beak is seldom shut,&#148; observed Pranswat, getting to his
feet. He looked round at his bedraggled Ferren. &#147;Come, we will move on.&#148;
</p>
<p>
There were no objections. He guided them to the south-eastern corner of the
square, from where holosigns indicated they had the choice of either
re-crossing the Stirrow via the Yarp Street bridge, leading to what
promised to be the gaudy extravagance of Gropp&#146;s Market, or of continuing
towards the imposing floral archway which was the closest entrance to
Garrible Park. Immune to whatever expensive lures the Yarp Street arcades
might have to offer, the Omnant led his Ferren into the welcoming expanse
of the park.
</p>
<p>
In Fountain Square a small crowd had gathered around the irate woman who
was complaining loudly that some strange men had made her little boy cry.
Where they were now, or what they had said or done was not entirely clear,
but there was general agreement that more should be done to protect
children in public places.
</p>
<p class=drop>As soon as they had entered the park the air seemed to lose its earlier
chill and acquire an exhilarating freshness. They were unaware that the
paths had been fitted with thermostatic tiles, and that among the border
plants on either side the elegant stands of tropical grasses were
genetically modified to increase oxygen production. These were among the
innovations introduced by Garrible Park&#146;s newly promoted design
consultant, a resourceful young woman noted as much for her flame-coloured
hair as for her creative landscaping.
</p>
<p>
They made their way slowly through the park, admiring the abundance of
exotic trees, the subtle blending of colours and textures, the unexpected
contrasts in foliage and blossom, dense ground-cover giving way to
velvet-smooth clearings in which there might be a single whimsical flaunt
or a cluster of enigmatic sculptures. The park was inhabited by the usual
scattering of people, variously eating, reading, exercising, strolling,
dozing, walking their modifidos or more outlandish paraPets.
Horticulturalists formed knowledgeable groups around rare botanical
specimens. Clinging couples sauntered, pausing to kiss. Young children
pulled their escorting adult towards the play area.
</p>
<p>
A short distance away from one of the sculptures a solitary figure stood
staring at nothing in particular, deep in reverie or contemplation. The
Omnant and his group had quietly gathered round the construct: an
arrangement of polished silvery dishes held in aerial suspension by a
tracery of transparent rods and fine cables. Fer Muard, still learning to
curb an instinctive impatience, began to pace round it, peering up and down
in search of an inscription. The others waited until he had completed two
such irregular orbits.
</p>
<p>
&#147;I see no plaque,&#148; he announced.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Labelling is but an adjunct to identity,&#148; observed Pranswat. &#147;As much for
that which is wrought, as that which forms without intervention.&#148; Noticing
a few uncomprehending looks among the Ferren he added quickly, &#147;But perhaps
some of you might like to suggest a suitable title?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;&#146;Accident in the kitchen&#146;&#148;, promptly offered Fer Nadfal.
</p>
<p>
&#147;&#146;The Ju&#133; The Jug&#133; Juggler&#146;s Str&#133; Str&#133; Struggle?&#146;&#148; Fer Swoam blinked
modestly, taken aback by his own temerity.
</p>
<p>
Fer Dilguar had been gazing blankly at the suspended discs. Not normally
prone to leaps of the imagination, he believed he had spotted a theme.
&#147;&#146;Stuck!&#146;&#148; he declared.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Pardon me, gentlemen.&#148;
</p>
<p>
The tall leather-clad man who had been standing nearby approached them. He
looked to be in his twenties. His expression was slightly concerned, but
his manner was friendly.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Forgive the intrusion, but I couldn&#146;t help overhearing. My name is Clage.
I happen to be slightly acquainted with the designer of this construction,
Irkel Upquap. It is one of a series he calls &#145;Timepieces&#146;. They do not have
individual titles, but all relate to the perception of time.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Pranswat turned abruptly from his examination of the sculpture, causing the
hem of his robe to flap. &#147;We are grateful for the information, Clage. Are
you by chance also an artist?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;No, I have neither the necessary skills, nor the required temperament. I
am a humble student of philosophy.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Pranswat smiled. &#147;Then we have more in common than the outward evidence of
our shared humanity.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Clage hesitated before replying. He could be mistaken, but when the man had
whirled round he had definitely glimpsed a flash of blue and silver, which
could mean that for him this was a rare opportunity. He decided it was not
a time for caution.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Would I be right in thinking that you are members of the Order of Seven
Streams?&#148;
</p>
<p>
The Ferren were visibly startled. The Omnant&#146;s smile broadened.
</p>
<p>
&#147;You are most perceptive, Clage. We are indeed. These are my Ferren:
Cargat, Muard, Jaulf, Bireng, Lebbark, Ruxis, Swoam, Nadfal, Trulkh and
Dilguar.&#148; He indicated each in turn. &#147;I am Cherth Pranswat, Omnant
Exemplary, of Sirisulsor.&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;It is an honour to meet you. I am not an adherent of any established set
of doctrines, but the course I teach here at Sparagulan College includes a
study of the principles of your Order. They have a clarity which I find is
universally applicable.&#148;
</p>
<p>
The Omnant spread his arms. &#147;They are at everyone&#146;s disposal. We are not
hoarders.&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;May I ask what brings you to Snoak?&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Our pod was bound for Meheric, but a mechanical fault persuaded the pilot
that this would be a more appropriate destination.&#148;
</p>
<p>
&#147;Ah. &#145;<i>Accommodate, evaluate. Where needed, ameliorate?</i>&#146;&#147;
</p>
<p>
&#147;I see you are an attentive scholar, Magister Clage,&#148; said the Omnant
jovially. &#147;As my Ferren well know, even the emptiest bowl is full of
possibilities.&#148;
</p>
<p>
Clage was not quite sure whether this was a compliment or a reproach.
Perhaps he had been too familiar. Should he have used a more formal mode of
address? Had he affronted the Ferren with his gauche lack of deference? He
made a point of trying to treat others as equals, and was not intimidated
by authority, but after all, he reminded himself, he was speaking to an
actual Omnant - here in Garrible Park - a distinguished
representative of a very select community. Pranswat interrupted his
introspection.
</p>
<p>
&#147;You appeared to be meditating as we arrived,&#148; he stated. It was not a
question, and Clage could simply have smiled and nodded, but in front of
this eminent stranger he felt a compelling need to be completely honest.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Not so much meditating, as reminiscing,&#148; Clage admitted. &#147;I used to come
here with a good friend &#150; a young woman. We were very close for a while,
even though we didn&#146;t always agree. It&#146;s been a long time since I&#146;ve seen
her, and, well, I miss the arguments.&#148;
</p>
<p>
The Omnant looked up at him, his deep-set dark eyes seeming to reach into
Clage&#146;s thoughts. &#147;The arguments?&#148; he echoed helpfully, steepling his
fingers.
</p>
<p>
&#147;I suppose I really mean that I miss the girl,&#148; Clage confessed,
astonishing himself with the plain truth of this revelation. There was no
doubt that he used to relish their bouts of intellectual sparring. Tebbi
had a lively mind, and a range of interests wider than his own. She was the
radiance to his spotlight. Sudden wistful flashes of memory reminded him of
intimate moments they had shared. No previous or subsequent relationship
had been so volatile and yet so tender.
</p>
<p>
Pranswat was still watching his face. &#147;Then of course you must act
accordingly,&#148; he said. &#147;Though I cannot claim any expertise in these
matters. When all leaves are shed, no twig remains hidden,&#148; he added,
turning to his acolytes. &#147;Come, Ferren, we must not detain Magister Clage
further. I believe he has a mission to accomplish.&#148; With formal nods of
acknowledgement the Omnant and his grey-robed group moved away from
Upquap&#146;s suspended discs in the direction of Thrissop Hill, following the
path which led to the sunken garden.
</p>
<p>
Clage raised a hand in farewell, and stood watching them recede, feeling
unusually calm. He wondered idly whether anyone &#150; CenSec for example, kept
a check on the identity of visitors to the park. Would Tebbi be surprised
to know that he had met a genuine Omnant? If they did monitor visitors, he
supposed that somewhere there could be a visual record of his own
melancholy meanderings in all the many months since he and Tebbi had last
been here together. He had not seen her since his final year as a student,
when she was working as a researcher at Quanderpyre Tower. It was odd, but
he couldn&#146;t remember now why they had fallen out. If he could track her
down, no doubt she would remind him; another risk worth taking, he thought.
She used to live nearby with her friend Cendrel, and although he did not
have Tebbi&#146;s current address, he knew exactly where Cendrel could be found.
Over a rise to his left he could just see the dome of the neatly porticoed
building where she worked. He began to stride in that direction, swinging
his arms with a certain rediscovered assurance.
</p>
<p class=drop>Descent into the sunken garden was afforded by means of wide shallow steps,
on either side of which, amid a diversity of mosses and ferns, twin
waterfalls fed by hidden pipes tumbled over rocks down to a central pool.
Ornamental bridges arched over each cascade, giving access to the mosaic
paths on the other side. On these dry terraces of the elliptical hollow the
park&#146;s topiarists had created a fantastic tableau of animals and birds.
Among these the Omnant and Ferren wandered with undisguised curiosity and
occasional amusement, commenting on unexpected quirks of scale or
capricious embellishments, such as the chain clutched in the talons of an
eagle, or the jaunty hats perched on the heads of a troupe of otters.
</p>
<p>
In the depths of the pool, beneath flowering lotus and water poppies the
Ferren observed sinuous flickers of movement; twists of scarlet, orange and
glittering blue. Pranswat drew their attention to the series of regularly
spaced spindly objects which stood around the pool. From a distance these
had appeared to be saplings, but on closer inspection were more like
elegant antique hatstands. From each of them hung several detachable
acoustic helmets. Some were already in use by other visitors. The rapt
expressions of those wearing them suggested there was evidently something
worth hearing. Notices explained that the pool was stocked with piscoids &#150;
tonally interactive autokoi and goldfins from the Artifishery labs in
Platport, and people were invited to &#145;listen in&#145;. As the devices became
available all the Ferren were able to experience the ethereal harmonies
generated by the piscoids as they performed their untiring underwater
ballet, continuously interweaving without ever colliding.
</p>
<p>
Having deferred his own turn, Pranswat thoughtfully replaced the helmet on
its padded hook.
</p>
<p>
&#147;Beguiling sounds indeed. The attentive ear responds to birdsong, thunder
and the lapping of waves as well as any product of a composer&#146;s mind, but
what should we make of this intriguing hybrid music of piscoids?&#148;
</p>
<p>
The comparative study of musical cultures was an integral part of a
Ferren&#146;s training. They left the sunken garden in deep discussion, and
barely noticed some time later that they had walked half way round the
perimeter of Garrible Park, and were now at the Prossing Street gate. By a
happy chance this brought them within a few steps of Sparvey&#146;s, Snoak&#146;s
most recently established eating-house, which, while not in competition
with the more famous Cylinder, prided itself in serving wholesome food at
reasonable prices. While the Ferren were by habit frugal, the Omnant saw no
need to test their endurance unnecessarily. It was already late afternoon,
and it would do no harm for them to be fortified for the journey home.
</p>
<p class=drop>Sparvey&#146;s welcoming door opened to the stately procession of grey robes.
Their wearers were for the most part calmly impassive, as befitted the
dignity of their Order. Chorren Sparvey had had a relatively quiet day, and
was not averse to this unexpected arrival of custom. He personally ensured
that the seating arrangements were satisfactory, instructed his staff to
distribute menus and provide tempting bowls of complimentary appetizers. He
wondered who they might be? A troupe of actors, perhaps, or residents of a
local care home out for a spree? Whoever they were, to his experienced eye
they all looked as though they would benefit from a decent meal.
</p>
<p>
An hour or so later, replete, rested and refreshed they set off for the
podport, having established the most direct route from the map on Sparvey&#146;s
wallscreen. The sky, now a deepening greyish-violet, enhanced the hypnotic
beauty of the globe which hung just to their left above the art market,
like a huge coruscating marble.
</p>
<p>
&#147;The creation of a Mr Weiger, according to Chorren Sparvey,&#148; said the
Omnant, who had learned this after paying for their very satisfactory meal.
&#147;Snoak&#146;s private supplementary moon, lacking the scars of time, but
pleasing to behold.&#148;
</p>
<p>
They took the riverside path, skirting Praspafole Stadium. At this hour
there was relatively little traffic on this stretch of the Stirrow; a few
leisurely skimmers and the odd well-preserved commercial barge. Vehicles
were officially prohibited along the pedestrian path, but there were
occasional transgressors, usually in the form of adrenalin-fuelled
teenagers, such as the whooping gang who came speeding towards them
recklessly on their racing twindles on both sides of the path. Unperturbed,
the Omnant raised one arm, his upright fingers signalling a straight-line
formation, which the obedient Ferren adopted immediately, allowing safe
passage in both directions. After a few moments there was a sound like the
distant dropping of a bunch of keys, and the whoops abruptly ceased. The
injuries turned out not to be serious, and Fex&#146;s repair shop in the
Scruttings never turned custom away.
</p>
<p>
Chorren Sparvey had made a discovery.  Amid the bustle of food preparation
he had not found time to ask his robed visitors where they hailed from, and
was still thinking of them as he checked the daily takings before closing.  He
could see at once that the total was wrong.  He went over the figures
again, carefully, matching payments received against individual orders and
time of transaction.  There was no doubt.  While he had been telling the
gentleman with the amused dark eyes about the local landmarks, that same
gentleman had unobtrusively added a startlingly generous sum in
appreciation of service received.
</p>
<p>
Not long later, looking down on Snoak&#146;s unique constellation of lights from
the quietly humming security of the departing nightpod, Cherth Pranswat
reflected that it had been an instructive day, fortunately with no mishaps.
He turned to survey his Ferren. To most people their expressions would have
seemed inscrutable, but as an Omnant he could read in each of them telltale
signs, if not yet of the open-minded understanding which was the aim of
their Order, then at least a lessening in perplexity. That, after all, was
a step in the right direction.
