<div><i>&#147;When something goes wrong, the first thing 
I think is, it is Loki's fault. It saves a lot of time.&#148;
<br /><small>Neil Gaiman</small></i>
<p class="drop"><i>The bench was dedicated to
no-one. Screwed to the floor, amidst an ashen road of marble. Opposite,
the glazed-windows of a boutique shop-front. A line of parallel trees,
planted in consolation; an unconvincing canopy, half-sheltering swathes
of early-bird consumers and breakfastless commuters from the
unseasonably harsh autumn sun. </i></p> <P><i>Two males sit on its shaded slats. One glares out at life; eyes
shifting impatiently from the trotting, ear-phoned thirty-somethings
to the closed sign that hangs askew against the door. It is not due to
open for another hour. The companion to his right twitches, and squints
at the cerulean sky. &#147;Will you sit still?&#148; <P>&#147;I&#146;m itchy.&#148; <P>&#147;That&#146;s because you didn&#146;t dry off properly&#133; How many times do I have to
tell you, you can&#146;t just shake dry when you take off your skin!?&#148; <P>Inside the wardrobe of a nearby Travelodge, two suspended seal skins
stagnate on coat-hangers, a salted-pool dampening the wood beneath them.
</i> <P><i>The bustling city centre swells. The scent of brylcreem and
brow-sweat fills the nostrils of the agitated bench-sitters. They gaze
towards the milky gloss of the unlit store. Only fifty-yards away, yet
as if a distant buoy, bobbing ever nearer to the horizon, threatening to
drop behind the curvature of the Earth. &#147;Where are you, you bitch?!&#148; he
thinks&#133; <P>Light blonde and pale skin, a pearl necklace. She dresses the hands of a
vacant mannequin. The door opens with a ping and the males move swiftly
inside. The store assistant&#146;s nostrils fill with the putrid scent of a
red-tide as the darker of the disguised beasts moves in behind her,
close enough to whisper in her ear. A semi-human voice, the timbre of a
snarling bear. <P>&#147;Do you like to swim?&#148; he says. </i></p> <P><p class=drop>Mucm&#243;r had scouted out the mushrooms from within the
crevices of a
dying poplar. It was fleshy and umber in colour; the only one of its
kind to grant him visions without a two day headache in exchange.
&#147;Salt-wolves.&#148; he thought, processing the hallucination, &#147;Fascinating&#148;.
He watched the seal-men drag their hostage in his mind&#146;s eye, and
allowed his hind legs to collapse behind him. He had been on his feet
for quite some time and pigs were not known for trekking long distances,
especially ones as large as him.  <P>His brother Tetorc emerged from behind a juniper bush. He was much
smaller than Mucm&#243;r and while Mucm&#243;r was endowed with a healthy pinkish
hue, proudly decorated with large dark spots, Tetorc was covered from
snout to tail in shimmering copper bristles; a coat to match his coarse
wit and hot temper. <P>&#147;Dammit, Mucm&#243;r!&#148; The red boar scoffed in admonishment, &#147;We&#146;ve at
least twenty leagues yet to travel and here you are resting with all the
cares of a suckling.&#148; <P>&#147;I am a suckling of the Earth, dear brother&#148; the large pig retorted in a
spray of grey foam &#147;and besides, my hunger for knowledge has borne fruit
&#150; or fungus as least.&#148; Tetorc&#146;s eyes widened and he looked over his
shoulder to make sure they were alone. Their master was not far behind
and he could not be certain whether their conversation was forbidden of
servants.  <P>&#147;It seems&#148; Mucm&#243;r began, still entranced &#147;that two selkies came ashore
to exact
vengeance on the owner of a small business. They were selling
clothing to humans made from seal-skin&#133;&#148;  <P>The red boar nodded with understanding &#147;I can sympathise. After all, who
has suffered more at the hands of man than pigs, over the past century?
But why one merchant, why not tackle an entire vessel of sealers?&#148; <P>&#147;It was their sister,&#148; he answered, grinding another mushroom between
his large yellowing molars. &#147;She had been captured by hunters. The
selkies plucked the information from a seagull, a real squawker. Told
them where and how her body had been used.&#148;  <P>Tetorc shot his brother a gaze of concern and intrigue. He stepped a few
feet closer in order to whisper. &#147;And did the goddess R&#225;n permit such a
flagrant abuse of her capture-rights?&#148;  <P>Mucm&#243;r furrowed his brow and rolled his eyes into the back of his head
for a moment before beginning to speak once more. &#147;The selkies swore
not. They came by river. Shed their skins, and walked inland. They said
R&#225;n hadn&#146;t been doing anything about recent pollution or attacks on the
ocean&#146;s wildlife. They said she preferred to spend her time <i>dancing
in maelstroms and plaiting refracted light into her hair.</i> But&#133;&#148; The
large pig shook his head as if searching the air for more information
&#147;&#133;when they drowned the store manager in the sea, Woden&#146;s ravens
reported it as an offering to the goddess <i>forcefully and deceptively
taken</i>.&#148;  <P>Tetorc remembered what their master had once told them, that R&#225;n&#146;s
capture-rights only allowed her to capsize the vessels of sailors she
believed to be of blackened heart and that she was known to usually keep
to this code - though it had been noted how the ships belonging to
&#147;black-hearted sailors&#148; were often the ones with the most treasure on
board. It was little wonder that Woden, the mistrusting king of the
gods, had banished R&#225;n to the uttermost reaches of the world. To the
poles of the north and the south.  <P>&#147;He shared out control of her former domains among the remaining sea
gods.&#148; Mucm&#243;r said, his focus now snapping back to meet his brother. His
eyes, bloodshot ovals with irises of a brilliant ice blue. &#147;You know the
rest, of course.&#148; <P>Tetorc nodded his head regretfully. R&#225;n had set about destroying the
fragile ice caps that punctuated the globe, rapidly raising the world&#146;s
waters till the lands of the earthen gods began to dwindle. The brothers
had always known that R&#225;n was responsible, but it was only now that they
knew why. Along with the floods, she set great beasts, gigantic
creatures from the crushing depths of the ocean, to guard these new
water-locked realms &#150; but none were so important to Mucm&#243;r and Tetorc&#146;s
master than <i>Mur-Temna</i>. Word had reached them via a network of
trees &#150; their whispers transferred beneath the soil from oak to ash and
birch to lime - of a &#147;bloated rubicund beast; an exsufflicate,
perpetually enraged&#148;. It was a kraken, dwelling where once verdant
fields had spanned and where a sea-roof now suffocated all green to murk
and all soil to silt. The Dagda and his boars were heading to reclaim
this once pleasant pasture. <P><p class= drop>>The Dagda was known as <i>The Good God</i>. In his
corporeal form,	he
was a large, broad-chested man. A mound of auburn hair topped his head,
and he bore a beard of the same shade, save a shock of white beneath his
chin. His stomach was not flat - his mortal form was far too fond of
bread and drinks brewed from threshed corn - but the protective suit he
had donned, since he heard the war broke out, pulled his gut inwards,
presenting a firm abdomen to match his timber-like arms. Gods could
never die in the true sense, but a mortal body could be wounded beyond
repair, and having to transpose one&#146;s metaphysical self into a new
visible individual was a rigmarole he could scarcely be bothered with. A
stab-proof vest and a few metallic adornments were a sensible
precaution,
he thought, in a time of automatic rifles and air-borne missiles. His
weapon of choice had not changed over the millennia, however. A giant
club of solid oak rested upon his shoulders, a subtle motif of silver
leaves gilded into its base. In days gone by, people had told stories of
its power; to both end and restore life, but it had been a long time
since Dagda had extended the gift of life granted by the base of his
club.  <P>He leapt over a stream, and caught up to his rotund familiars. &#147;What are
you two grunting about? Eating again I see, Mucm&#243;r&#148;.  <P>&#147;Yes, master.&#148; the large pig snorted unapologetically.  <P>&#147;Well, come, we&#146;ve many more miles to travel. We&#146;ve managed to skirt
around most of the checkpoints, but there is an unavoidable one at the
crossing of Mur-Temna. We will eat and rest when we are close by.&#148; <P>The pigs nodded and carried on traversing the obstacles of the
forest. <P>The war had been a great upset to the fragile balance of the world. Not
only were Earth-based gods burdened with protecting the lands from R&#225;n&#146;s
sea-monsters, civil wars had broken out the world over. Half of each
continent was nearly submerged. Crop-fields lay waterlogged and food
became scarce as low-plained cities became the lairs of oblivious fish.
Sharks swam down library corridors and barnacles clung to abandoned
buses and aircraft. Reservoirs, once brimming with drinkable water, were
now salty troughs in a sea of indifferent brine. The world and all its
resources were ravished. Martial law ensued and tribal fortifications
emerged, guarded by mostly untrained soldiers of fortune. <P><p class=drop>The checkpoint of Mur-Temna was not so much a checkpoint
as a
fortified village, the gates of which were solid steel, hinged within an
expanse of pallid concrete and fringed with a helix of barbed wire. A
whole manner of commandeered street signs littered the pathway to the
doors: NO ENTRY; TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; BEWARE OF THE DOG;
ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK! <P>&#147;Well, that&#146;s confusing&#148; scoffed Tetorc as they approached. &#147;Can we
enter or not? And there doesn&#146;t appear to be a dog in sight.&#148;  <P>&#147;Dogs are too smart to stay in a place like this.&#148; offered Mucm&#243;r in an
equally incredulous tone &#147;Humans on the other hand&#133;&#148; <P>Dagda smirked and moved a few paces ahead so they would not see. He did
not want to encourage this sort of banter if they were to be taken
seriously. <P>As they came within fifty yards of the gate, there was a sudden furore
of shouting and a metallic racket of guns being cocked. A voice came
from above the wall. &#147;Stand where you are, big man!&#148; <P>Dagda searched the top of the wall for the origin of the voice, and
found a woman; ash-blonde hair in a harsh pony tail; body encased in a
black jumpsuit and her right eye peering
down the sight of an
automatic rifle. A deafening silence fell about the place, broken only
by the sound of Mucm&#243;r chewing noisily on some nearby berries - the
soldiers wouldn&#146;t have expected a pig to heed their command anyway&#133; <P>&#147;Are those pigs?&#148; another voice called out. A man this time. Watchtower,
to the right. &#147;Christ on a bike, I&#146;ve not seen a pig in years. And look
at the size of the bleedin&#146; thing! That pink one&#146;s like a feckin&#146; bear!&#148; <P>&#147;Shut up, Sullivan&#148; the woman&#146;s voice retorted, before bringing her
attention back to Dagda. &#147;State your purpose. Who are you, why are you
here?&#148; <P>&#147;My name is Oak&#148; Dagda answered, &#147;I hear you have been having some
trouble with a giant octopus in these parts. Thought I might be of
service to you.&#148; <P>The woman snorted &#147;The whole world has been having trouble with giant
sea creatures! Sharks, crabs, octopuses. You name it, peop-&#133; Jesus,
Ganley, I&#146;m not having this discussion again; <i>octopuses</i> is an
acceptable term!&#148; <P>&#147;She&#146;s right, you know.&#148; Mucm&#243;r whispered to his bristled brother.
Tetorc didn&#146;t acknowledge him. <P>&#147;So, what makes an unarmed man, and his pigs, interested in our
particular problem? You don&#146;t look like you&#146;re from around here. Why
don&#146;t you turn back &#145;round and piss off back to where you came from?&#148; <P>A strange expression swept across Dagda&#146;s face; one the brothers had
never seen before. It was offence. &#147;I used to live here, a long time
ago. And I can assure you that I am as armed as I will ever need to
be.&#148; he pointed his club up to the sky. It was an impressive sight from
down on the ground, but it was clear that the gravitas was lost upon the
inhabitants of the high wall. An eruption of laughter sounded and lasted
a little too long to be genuine. <P>&#147;Ha! He&#146;s gonna beat it to death with that thing? Good luck, pal.&#148;
Red-headed lad, no older than nineteen.  <P>&#147;Go on, Maeve! Let him in. We don&#146;t see many have-a-go-heroes these
days. And I&#146;d pay to see the old beast swallow this fool up. You never
know, he might be able to give him a bit of a twatting before the end.
Worth a laugh I reckon.&#148; <P>The woman in charge looked to the man who had spoken, paused for a
moment and lowered her gun. She faced Dagda and pointed her finger to
the red-headed lad who had spoken. &#147;Donnell here once threw a grenade at
the monster. Not a scratch. All eight disgusting limbs intact. It just
made the thing more angry. That night it crawled out of its lair onto
Drybank and it took our dogs away with it. Two years later and Donnell
has only just finished his penance in the fort kitchens. I won&#146;t lie, we
want rid of the thing, but keeping the prick contained and stopping it
terrorising other nearby camps and forts is our one claim to success so
far. Sets us apart from the likes of Culin at least, where everyone just
up and ran leaving us to force back their giant dogfish. Isn&#146;t that
right, lads?&#148; She broke off to allow for a chorus of &#147;Culin cunts&#148; and
&#147;dogfish fuckers!&#148; to ensue.  <P>&#147;I don&#146;t know what the fuck you think you can do that we can&#146;t.&#148; she
continued &#147;But if you want to try and earn some personal glory by taking
on the kraken with a jumped-up two-by-four, then fine, be our guest.
Aye, might be a laugh, Sullivan.&#148; <P>Dagda smiled and gave a single nod of his head &#147;I live to spread joy,
commander. At your wish, I will either slay the beast or attempt to die
in the most amusing way possible.&#148; <P>Maeve looked pleased &#147;But, in case it all goes horribly wrong, and you
just enrage the salt-bag further&#133; well, we don&#146;t have any more dogs left
as you can see, and we can&#146;t afford to lose any more of our men or
women. If you want to fight the beast of Mur-Temna, we need some
collateral.&#148;   <P><p class=drop>&#147;So, how are you finding life as a piece of collateral,
Mucm&#243;r?&#148; Tetorc asked his fellow captive. <P>&#147;A little tight round the ankles truth be told, brother.&#148; The two pigs
were in a small enclosed courtyard, chained by the hind legs to the wall
and with nothing but a small bowl of water for sustenance. &#147;I&#146;m very
hungry though, I have to admit.&#148; <P>&#147;Makes a change.&#148; <P>&#147;I don&#146;t know about you&#148; Mucm&#243;r continued &#147;but I&#146;m quite surprised he
agreed to this quite so quickly.&#148; <P>&#147;Really?&#148; Tetorc retorted, &#147;I&#146;m surprised they even had to ask. Great
fool. We&#146;re the only reason they let him in.&#148; <P>&#147;I don&#146;t follow.&#148; Mucm&#243;r replied. <P>&#147;Come on, you fat swine. For all your gifts of foresight, you can&#146;t see
what a band of starving soldiers would possibly want with two pigs,
especially one as large as yourself?&#148;  <P>Mucm&#243;r did not appear to be listening all that intently. He took in the
makeshift cell around them &#150; old stone walls, broken bits of MDF
furniture, a narrow archway with an iron-railed gate for an entrance.
&#147;They don&#146;t believe he&#146;s going to succeed. They think he&#146;s just some
glory-hunting eejit. And we are their dinner for the next fortnight.&#148; <P>Mucm&#243;r looked nonplussed, &#147;Nah.&#148; he said, and nibbled where the cuff was
chafing him. &#147;I have faith.&#148; <P>&#147;<i>Faith</i>? Mucm&#243;r, I&#146;m not saying that Dagda cannot defeat the
creature. I&#146;m saying that by then it will be too late. The humans won&#146;t
wait around for that. They will slit our throats as soon as Master sets
off to battle the monster!&#148; Tetorc&#146;s expression was one of distress, and
his bristles began to glow the colour of smelting steel. <P>&#147;No, not faith in the Dagda&#148; Mucm&#243;r smiled, his eyes rolling into the
back of his head. &#147;Faith in you.&#148; <P><p class=drop>Dagda was led by Commander Maeve Bradley down a narrow
alleyway of
high concrete walls. A bald man he had not seen at the checkpoint
entrance followed up the rear. They had allowed the good god to carry
his club with them as they walked. <i>They don&#146;t think I&#146;m quick
enough&#133;</i> Dagda thought to himself. The tip of the bald man&#146;s rifle
rested mere inches from the small of his back. The god meant these
soldiers no harm of course, but the insinuation that he was no faster
than a point-blank bullet put another dent in his already stricken ego.
<i>There was once a time when people knew me.</i> he thought, <i>a
golden age of love and awe.</i> <P>After what seemed a mile of faceless alleyway, they reached a gate made
from corrugated sheet metal. The commander unlocked the padlock attached
and pushed the gate open, slowly; she seemed to be worried that
something fragile stood behind it. The springs of its hinges creaked to
capacity and the commander stepped through the gap. <P>It was as if she had opened a door to the sea. In every direction, water
gently waved and the
smell of salt on the air sent the Dagda&#146;s mind
swimming with memories of walking coastlines, back when the Earth was
still young. What was left of the land was next to nothing, only a bank
of perhaps fifteen feet in diameter saved them from falling into this
new edgeless lake. <P>&#147;This is as far as I can take you, Mr Oak.&#148; Maeve said
to Dagda. &#147;I&#146;m
happy for you to have a crack at it, but the final say goes to Corporal
Lyons there.&#148; She nodded towards a man on the brink of the lake, sat in
a wheelchair, a green and blue tartan wrapped around what remained of
his legs. Dagda had barely even registered his presence till now; his
mind had been full with images of beaks and tentacles, the last thing he
expected to see was a wounded veteran gazing out at the water, still as
a lighthouse. <P>&#147;Good luck, Oak&#148; said the commander, before grasping his forearm as if
about to whisper. (She didn&#146;t whisper). &#147;But if you fuck up, you won&#146;t
be coming back through this gate. There&#146;s no running once you take on
the kraken. Win, or you and your pigs will die. If you try to run, you
will die, and your pigs will die. I&#146;m gonna be just up there&#148; she
pointed towards the sky behind them, another fortified wall guarded by
soldiers armed to the teeth with artillery and smirks. &#147;I will have my
sight on you the whole time, big man.&#148; Dagda pulled his arm away and
smiled with genuine warmth. <P>&#147;Don&#146;t blink.&#148; <P><p class=drop>Tetorc took a deep breath and began to calm down. The heat
of his
bristles began to simmer and his burning heart slowed to a steady rhythm
once more. The chain that bound him, however, glowed a faint red like
the hob of a recently deactivated stove. &#147;Feeling better?&#148; his large
counterpart asked. Tetorc nodded and sighed. &#147;Good, you need to save
your strength, brother. He&#146;s about to come.&#148; <P>Tetorc looked up at the entrance to their cell, &#147;Who is?&#148; <P>Footsteps echoed down the hall on the other side of the iron gate. From
the shadows emerged a man of average height, perhaps thirty-five years
in age. He held an old jailer&#146;s key in one hand but held the other
behind his back. He slowly entered the room. &#147;Hey there, fellas.&#148; he
half whispered &#147;Shhh, we&#146;re gonna be nice and calm about this, aye. We
don&#146;t want to spoil your&#133;erm, spoil anything, so we&#146;re gonna be quick
and cool about this&#148; he spoke soothingly and stroked Mucm&#243;r on the head.
He turned and stepped over towards Tetorc. In the reflection of Mucm&#243;r&#146;s
eyes, he could see the butchering knife behind the man&#146;s back. &#147;Now, I
don&#146;t like to do this, fellas, but we&#146;ve got lots of hungry lads and
lasses in this place, and I&#146;m the cook so&#133;&#148; He reached for Tetorc&#146;s
chain. &#147;Aaarrrghhh! Fuck! Jesus Christ!&#148; His palm immediately flared
into a large blistering sore. He dropped the knife to the floor and
grabbed his wrist with his other hand. Noticing the bowl of water, he
fell to his knees and plunged his hand in wrist-deep. He groaned a sigh
of relief. But his reprieve was short-lived. As quick as lightning
Tetorc sprang forward and thrust his tusk up into the right eye of the
cook. The man let out a series of shrill screams, he thrashed and beat
wildly against the boar as Tetorc bucked his head up and down, pushing
his tusk deeper through the socket and into his brain. The man&#146;s screams
became a garbled mumble, and Tetorc let him fall to the floor to bleed
out his last.  <P>&#147;Good work, brother.&#148; Mucm&#243;r exclaimed and with a powerful kick of his
leg, pulled his chain and its link from the brick wall. Tetorc stared at
his brother in bemusement, &#147;Could you have done that at any time?&#148; <P>&#147;Of course,&#148; the large swine replied flatly, &#147;but now the gate&#146;s
unlocked.&#148; <P><p class=drop>Dagda made his way over to the man in the wheelchair.
&#147;Corporal
Lyons, is it? I believe I am meant to speak with you, sir. My name
is-&#148; <P>&#147;Oak, yes they told me. Oak. Hmm&#133;&#148; his eyes remained fixed as a distant
stare across the lake. &#147;Is that an anglicised name, Oak? It&#146;s not an
Irish word, is it?&#148; his voice was nasal and stern. <P>&#147;It is an English word, yes, like the tree.&#148; <P>&#147;Like the tree&#133; ah yes. Lobed leaves, acorns. I know it well, lad.&#148;
Dagda wondered if he had ever been patronised before. He had half a mind
to reveal his true identity; claw back some of the awe and worship he
had received in the good old days. With one flick of the metaphorical
wrist, he could turn his face to lightning and render them all
speechless. But it was only <i>half</i> of his mind. The other half
remained patient and his heart remained warm. Warm enough to humour an
old man who had seen better days at least. Or so he had thought&#133; <P>&#147;I don&#146;t suppose you&#146;re old enough to remember <i>The Troubles</i> are
you lad?&#148; <P>&#147;I-&#148; <P>&#147;Oh, those were bad times, lad. Tribal in-fighting, that&#146;s all it was &#150;
death for the utter shittin&#146; sake of it. Over Rome; over Britain. I was
a soldier, but I didn&#146;t want any part in it. My job was to keep the
peace.&#148; he shuffled the stump underneath his blanket, &#147;But we didn&#146;t
have peace. Hell, we didn&#146;t even have civility. I don&#146;t remember which
side threw the bomb at me. It doesn&#146;t fuckin&#146; matter, none of it does,
it&#146;s not important; it wasn&#146;t really important then when people thought
it was, and it&#146;s damn sure not important anymore. Do you get what I&#146;m
saying, laddie?&#148; Dagda shot him a quizzical gaze. The man was clearly
suffering, and he wanted to let him vent &#150; he was a good god after all &#150;
but he was also growing impatient to start the job at hand and couldn&#146;t
help but feel that he was being stalled.  <P>The old corporal&#146;s pale eyes began to flick across the water as if
watching an invisible skimming stone. &#147;We have peace now though&#133; of a
sort. When the seas rose and that monstrous dogfish began to terrorise
the people of Culin, silly ideas like <i>papal infallibility</i> went
out the window. Whether you thought you were Irish or British no longer
mattered. All anyone cared about was the fact that there was a fish
where there ought never have been a fish. That men, women and children
were being swallowed whole when it dared to ride the waves inland. Oh,
but we stopped it. All of us stopped it. Except the people from Culin of
course, they all ran off, took as many supplies as they could and left
us to it. My guess is they&#146;re all dead now. Robbed at the next fort as
like as not. You see? Peace isn&#146;t about pacifism, it&#146;s not even about
stability. It&#146;s about necessity. We fight and we kill, and we steal and
we do what needs to be done. There is a balance in that, you see? None
of this finding a reason to fight. Peace is fighting because you have
to, and not fighting when there&#146;s no need. That&#146;s the natural way of
things, lad. We are closer to nature now than we have been for
centuries. We have beasts like the one in this lake to thank for that.
The kraken - the swallower of pointless death.&#148; <P>Dagda pondered all the old man had said for a moment. &#147;It almost sounds
as if you don&#146;t want the beast to be killed, corporal.&#148; <P>Lyons finally looked up to meet Dagda&#146;s eyes. A couple of days&#146; worth of
white stubble salted his chin and what was left of his hair had a slight
blondish hue. His lips were dry and cracked. <P>&#147;It&#146;s about perspective, that&#146;s all. She&#146;s a symbol. And you can draw a
symbol without the symbol drawing breath.&#148; <P>Dagda nodded in agreement &#147;That&#146;s true enough.&#148; He gazed out across the
water and wondered whether he would have to go swimming to draw the
beast out. Suddenly, the sand began to shift beneath his feet. The tiny
bank they were stood on began to shrink around them and Lyons&#146;s chair
edged closer to the water. &#147;Here she comes&#148; he said. The good god
quickly reached out, grasping hold of the chair&#146;s left handle. It jolted
and Lyons started to slide from his seat. He laughed, knowingly. <P>&#147;Good luck, Dagda.&#148; he said &#147;Give her one from me.&#148; and he fell sideways
into the lake. <P>&#147;Did he just call me Da-&#148; <P><i>WRROOOOOUUGHGGHKHKH!</i> <P><p class=drop>The kraken emerged from the lake, though
Dagda could hardly believe it.
If the lake had no edge it certainly had no bottom. It was truly
gargantuan. Its head a terracotta bishop&#146;s mitre, pitted with pores the
size of moon craters, boat-sized barbed spikes running down its centre.
Its arms surfaced next, thick as tree-trunks and shivering. Two of them
flailed wildly, while the others reached back on themselves, forcing the
rest of its body to emerge from the depths. The lake rained down around
it, the droplets like waves crashing against rocks. It let loose another
underwater shriek that shook the ground where Dagda was standing, and
finally he saw its eyes. Lidless and golden, the colour of bile; two
ultra-black pupils that appeared to physically suck at the light, each
easily the size of the Dagda himself.  <P>The god could hear shouts of encouragement from behind him, though he
could not be certain who they were for&#133; He took a deep breath and swung
his club clockwise from the ground, resting it on his right shoulder. He
turned himself side-on to present a smaller target and waited for an
advance from the beast. The attack took him by surprise; not a whipping
of girthy tentacles, but a twenty foot wave, rushing in his direction.
He tried to crouch and brace for the impact but it only engulfed him
quicker; sweeping him off his feet and dragging him from the bank, deep
into the lake. He desperately pulled at the water, dragging himself
upwards to the surface. <i>Herrrgh-pp! </i>Air. He hadn&#146;t sunk too far
after all. He turned in the water to face the beast, club still in hand.
It plunged downwards, sinking with incredible speed and lacking all
grace. <i>He&#146;s going to attack me from underneath</i> the Dagda thought,
but abruptly felt the weight of the water pulling him in an arc;
forwards and downwards, following the path of the kraken&#146;s submergence.
Downwards and downwards. Deeper and deeper. All about him was dark. The
water above him seemed no shallower than below, but in the murk beneath
him he could just make out a jerking shadow. It came closer. It had
edges. <i>A moving rock? A beak!</i> It was not the lake about him, but
an encasement made of giant tentacles. He blindly beat at the fleshy
walls surrounding him. With each strike, an arm would flinch away but be
replaced by another in an instant. On land, Dagda could be quicker than
this, but the water slowed his movements and dulled his powerful blows.
The kraken&#146;s arms pushed down above him, once again forcing him closer
towards the razor-sharp abyss of its
beak. Again he forced back,
becoming increasingly aware of the growing feeling in his lungs, as if
they too wanted to escape the confines of his chest and make a break for
the surface on their own. <i>There&#146;s only one other option</i> he
thought, and relaxed his body. The kraken's arms yanked him down,
towards the
yawning chasm of its reeking maw. Dagda
raised his mighty club above
his head and using the rising momentum along with his enormous strength,
struck the upper part of the kraken&#146;s beak. The beast let out a
banshee-like wail, its obsidian beak shattered
and fragmented, pieces
glided past the Dagda and narrowly missed wounding him in the process.
The arms fell away and he could see light shimmering from above once
more. <P><i>HOOOOOAAAAUUPPP! </i>Dagda wasn&#146;t sure if he&#146;d ever breathed in so
much air in one go. He quickly clambered back up onto the bank and
coughed up the remainder of the water in his lungs. He heard a cry from
the wall, &#147;Well, is it dead?!&#148; Dagda wearily shook his head in response.
He got to his feet and looked skywards. He didn&#146;t have long; the beast
would soon emerge again. He steadied his breathing, and raised his club
into the air. <P>&#147;Oi! Why aren&#146;t you dead? That thing dragged you under, how are you
still breathing? Where&#146;s Lyons?&#148; the god ignored the interrogation from
behind, and waited.  <P>The day was growing later and the sky darker with it. Small droplets of
rain began to fall, moistening the Dagda&#146;s face which by now had dried
from his underwater ordeal. &#147;Come on, you hag!&#148; he whispered to himself.
He had held his club skywards for nearly half an hour now; his arm was
beginning to tire, and the jibes and questioning from the fortified wall
were also beginning to grow old.  <P>The sound of thunder, except, no, it was the lake; bubbling and swirling
and heaving; its waters a body of aquatic asthma. Once again the beast
rose furiously out of the water, its whole body transforming from brick
red to a fluorescent green, its eyes became darker and burned with
rage. <P>More voices came from behind, &#147;You&#146;ve really pissed him off now, mate!&#148; <P>
&#147;Shut it, Connolly! Can&#146;t you see this lad&#146;s not normal? COME ON, BIG
MAN!&#148;  <P><i>Finally, some encouragement,</i> thought Dagda. He looked up. Above
the kraken, the clouds had grown fat and hung heavy in the sky. He gave
the beast one final glare before letting out a boom of raucous laughter.
The beast flinched, and before it could lunge forward in an attempt to
crush Dagda beneath its immense weight, the god leapt high into the air,
hovering mere feet above its face. In a voice like the crack of
lightning, he yelled&#133; <i>CERRCE!  <P></i>The soldiers fell silent, dumbfounded by the scene before them. A
bolt of lightning dived from the sky, striking the tip of Dagda&#146;s club.
And with his club glowing like a pulsating blue star, the good god
rammed the beast between the eyes. With an almighty bang, the kraken was
launched backwards through the air, silent as death, and came to rest a
smouldering heap in the middle of the lake.  <P><i>BIG MAN! BIIIG MAAAN! BIIIIIIIG MAAAAAANNNNN! <P> <P></i>Dagda turned to face his won-over audience, smiling warmly and
trying hard to conceal the exhaustion he felt in his muscles. But the
scene before him was puzzling. Their joyful leaps in the air were as if
underwater. They leapt and sank slowly, as if time itself were
submerged.  <P>&#147;Good work, Oak&#148;. <P><i>That was Lyons&#146;s voice</i>. Dagda thought. He spun round
half-expecting a sodden one legged man in need of a hand. But there was
no one. &#147;I knew you&#146;d be able to do it&#148; the voice came again. Dagda
searched around him and noticed a large white bird scratching at the
sand beneath him.  <P>&#147;Corporal Lyons?&#148; <P>&#147;Come on, man. You&#146;re a god. You act as if you&#146;ve never seen another god
before.&#148; <P>Dagda stuttered, &#147;I- I&#133;&#148; In his heyday, the Dagda had been accompanied
by a band of many talented gods, but he had to admit it had been a
while. &#147;Of course, but I don&#146;t understand what you were doing here
disguised as an invalid. If you&#146;re a god, why didn&#146;t you take care of
the beast yourself, were you not strong enough?&#148;  <P>The seagull&#146;s right eye twitched. &#147;Well, it is true, brute force isn&#146;t
exactly my forte, but my being here is more what you would call
&#145;returning to the scene of the crime&#146;. You see, it was me&#133;&#148; <P>Dagda remained confused and this bothered him. He had once been hailed
as a god of wisdom, but at this moment he felt as ignorant as a gnome. <P>
&#147;Stop speaking in riddles!&#148; <P>&#147;The water. The floods. It was all me, right here. <i>This</i> is where
the magic happened.&#148; the bird flew upwards rudely flapping its wings in
Dagda&#146;s face. The good god swung for the bird, but it stealthily avoided
the death-bringing tip of his club. <P>&#147;What do you mean, you did all of this?&#148; he shouted, &#147;What about R&#225;n?
The ice-caps&#133;&#148; <P>The bird rolled its eyes in a way that birds generally can&#146;t, &#147;Did your
pigs not tell you? The fat one knows all about it &#150; he should really cut
down on the mushrooms you know.&#148; The Dagda folded his arms. &#147;Ugh&#133; I was
the one who told those selkies that their sister had become a pair of
prized gloves in the city. R&#225;n had nothing to do with it; she never
sanctioned anything. They should&#146;ve known better than to listen to a
seagull. Gulls only go out to sea to die, and you should never trust a
word that comes from the mouth of a dying bird.&#148; <P>Dagda shook his head, all this information was making his brain hurt, or
maybe it was the effects of being held in time. He turned to see the
soldiers still hovering in mid-air, expressions of glee carved into
their faces.  <P>&#147;Of course&#148; the bird continued, &#147;R&#225;n melting the ice caps helped move
proceedings along quite considerably, and what&#146;s more, she proved to be
an effective scapegoat. But it is here where the majority of the flood
came from. Here in Mur-Temna, the lake that poured into the ocean.&#148;<br
/>
&#147;But, why?&#148; Dagda questioned, the seeming pointlessness of it all made
his brow sweat. <P>&#147;I meant what I said, about peace. Okay, it might be a stretch to say we
have it <i>now</i>, what with all the civil wars, vigilantes and this
<i>famine</i> nuisance. But peace is something you have to struggle for
and the struggle will soon come to an end&#133; thanks to you.&#148;  <P>Dagda eyed him suspiciously. The bird had now transfigured into the
shape of a man, almost
without him noticing. Hair of deep green neatly
retreated from his pale face, his eyes the colour of moss. A slender
frame and a shit-eating grin. <P>&#147;What the fuck are you talking about?&#148; Dagda growled, he was swiftly
losing patience and frustratedly stabbed his club into the sand by his
feet. <P>&#147;Where have you been, Dagda?&#148; the green-haired god asked. <P>&#147;What?!&#148; <P>&#147;Where have you been? Sleeping in some land down south, for centuries.
What took you so long to get here?&#148; <P>The sudden and accusatory question left Dagda aghast, &#147;I-I, only just
heard, days ago! The trees told me!&#148;  <P>&#147;And who do you think told the trees to wake you? You see, the world
will recover from everything that&#146;s happened, and it will thrive better
than ever before. The population has decreased; people have a respect
for nature that hasn&#146;t been matched since the Stone Age. They have
perspective, Dagda, and have learned from the mistakes they think
<i>they</i> made. Ironic isn&#146;t it? Not a single Global Warming-denier
left on the planet and it wasn&#146;t even Global Warming that did it. As
soon as they have the land back the way it was, and fresh water becomes
abundant again, Mankind will prosper with a deference that their former
hubris never allowed them.&#148; <P>Dagda lowered himself to the ground, sitting on the bank with his club
rested on his knees.  <P>&#147;And what is my part in all this again, in your mind?&#148; <P>The green god looked even more pleased with himself &#150; if that were
possible. &#147;This is where you were born isn&#146;t it? This is where you
belong.&#148; <P>Dagda nodded &#147;That&#146;s why I came.&#148; <P>&#147;There are structures in this world that hold its people to ransom. And
you cannot change something so entrenched by conforming to it. Sometimes
you need to <i>break</i> it&#148; He stepped closer and put his arm around
the broad god&#146;s shoulders. He gestured out towards the lake, &#147;I broke
the structures, Oak. I broke them by drowning the world. Now, I am
leaving it to you to rebuild. For I am the god of mischief, and you are
the good god.&#148; <P>This did not sit well with the Dagda, though he struggled internally
with why. <i>Do the ends justify the means; can any means be justified
by a good end?</i> He concluded that it was perhaps too soon to know, he
had not yet seen the ends of which the facetious god had spoken. <P>Before he could respond, Dagda felt
himself unexpectedly falling,
hurtling forwards into the lake. At first he thought he had been shoved
by the smirking sylph, but as his body rushed quicker and deeper into
the water, he realised that the god was beside him, still grinning and
plunging them both into the depths.  <P>They reached the lake&#146;s floor. Dagda was not happy, to say the least; he
had not long escaped this place and the giant beast that tried to keep
him there, now he was being held here by a jester half his size.  <P>The slender god motioned a silent plea for the Dagda to not be hasty and
to see what he had to show him. Dagda reluctantly obliged and watched as
the green god produced an orb of iridescent blue. It lit up the
surrounding area to a hot azure, and sent the bottom dwellers of the
lake fleeing past their legs. Between their feet was revealed a small
hole, no wider than a plant pot. He opened his palm and motioned for
Dagda to place his club inside. Dagda was resolved, he did not trust
this god and his chest was once again beginning to hurt. <i>How many
times can a god nearly drown himself in one day</i>? he thought. But
from
his hands, amber light began to shine. The gilded leaves on the hilt of
his club had turned from silver to shimmering gold and the club resisted
his grip. This was something the Dagda had never expected to happen; his
club had never left his side and had always felt at home in his hands.
He could not deny his beloved weapon&#146;s own wish to be planted in the
ground, nor could he deny the coincidence. He sighed an effervescent
sigh and knelt down to place the hilt of the club in the hole. The green
god pushed in the surrounding silt to bury the base of it, and it stood
firmly and vertically of its own accord. Dagda shrugged and looked
blankly through the mirk at the god opposite him, wondering what he and
his favourite mace hoped to achieve by this. His companion just stood,
grinning. And that&#146;s when it happened. <P>The earth and the water began to quake. Dagda took this as a bad sign.
<i>Am I so unwise as to be tricked twice?</i> He tried desperately to
retrieve his club so that he could resurface and not leave his most
prized possession behind. But it would not move. As if it were rooted to
the spot. Had it sprouted <i>roots</i>? Beneath his fingers the club
began to swell and grow taller. He jumped back, but something moved
under his feet. <i>A branch?</i> The Dagda was shunted upwards, his club
expanding at a colossal rate, thrusting towards the surface, sprouting
new thick branches as great lobed leaves the size of a man burst from
enormous buds. <P><i>Air!</i> They had resurfaced, but yet the club continued to grow,
reaching for the clouds. The green-haired god hollered at the excitement
of it all, and Dagda looked down. The waters swirled in a downward
spiral, and the lake they had not two minutes ago been under was now no
more than an insignificant pond.  <P>&#147;Hu-ha! She&#146;s a wee bit o&#146; a drinker, this one!&#148; the funny god exclaimed
in the accent he had effected for Lyons.  <P>&#147;I don&#146;t understand&#148; replied the good god perplexed, &#147;How did you know
it would do that?&#148;  <P>&#147;My name is Loki, good god. It means <i>breaker</i>. And when you&#146;ve
spent as long as I have breaking things, you start to learn a few tricks
about fixing things too.&#148; <P>The tree finally breached the clouds and the Dagda saw that the sun had
not yet set. Its rays sent an incandescent array of warm colours across
the sky and the god was pleased to feel the radiance of its scarlet and
goldenrod waves. &#147;It won&#146;t just stop here either&#148; Loki continued &#147;Your
tree will carry on drinking. It will drink until all the lands the water
has taken have been returned.&#148; <P>Dagda could not believe it. Not since the world&#146;s creation had he seen
sights of such magnitude. The tree was sublime in every sense of the
word and he knew humans well enough to know that this would change
everything. <i>Maybe we will have peace after all. And the ends will
justify the means. Maybe we have all been played as pawns in Loki&#146;s
revolution, but who am I to complain? I am the luckiest pawn of all.</i>
Dagda breathed in the high air and dreamed of the praises that would soon
be sung hand in hand around the base of his titanic oak. <i>The time we
shall have together</i>. He turned to thank Loki, but he was already
gone. White wings swooping in the ebb and flow of a mountain breeze. <P>Back on the ground the soldiers were left gawping at the unimaginably
large tree that to their eyes had appeared from nowhere. They climbed
down from the wall. The lake was gone and the large bounty hunter with
it.  <P>Commander Maeve Bradley turned to Donnell &#147;Get this out on the radio. As
many
frequencies as you can. People need to see this! It&#146;s&#133; it&#146;s a feckin&#146;
miracle!&#148; <P>&#147;Yes, Commander.&#148; The boy turned on his heel and ran back inside the
fort.  <P><i>He said his name was Oak&#133;</i> <P><p class=drop>Two miles south of Mur-Temna, a large
wiry boar gathered berries and
beech-mast from the forest floor. His brother, an even larger
paradigm of a pig, sat entranced beneath a swaying ash tree. He had seen
the whole ordeal unfold from afar, the rocketing growth of the tree and
the Dagda riding it like some obliging gulfweed on a gnarled tidal
wave. <P>&#147;I suppose he did it, then.&#148; he called to his distracted brother,
&#147;Master, I mean. That oak tree really is something. People will come
from all around the world to see it. He&#146;ll be worshipped too, no doubt.
Probably more than he ever was. Maybe we should have stuck around after
all, Mucm&#243;r&#133; Eh, Mucm&#243;r&#133;&#148; <P>The large pig did not answer. Grey saliva dripped down his chin and, in
his eyes, blazing fires grew as tall as trees beneath the wide-toothed
grin of a green-haired man. </p> <P>
