<div><i><b>"Here cometh April again, and as far as I can see the world
hath
more fools in it than ever."</b>	<br><small>Charles Lamb</small></i>
<p class="drop">It&#146;s a clich&#233;, but when I wake up at first
I don&#146;t know where I am. </p> <P><p>I only know I'm desperate for tea.</p> <P><p>I fumble for my glasses on the bedside table, squint when I can&#146;t
find them, then recognise the little framed photo of our parents by the
lamp and it all comes back: <i>Joanie&#146;s birthday party</i>. I&#146;m at my
sister&#146;s place.</p>
	  
<p>I roll out of bed, still dressed from last night. March 31st, but not
any more. The alarm clock by the photo reads half ten, and I groan. I
must be last up: whatever happens next will be at my expense.</p>
	  
<p>I don&#146;t have to wait long. Joanie is sprawled on the bedroom floor,
arms and legs twisted into a comedy swastika. She missed being a fool by
twenty minutes, and now every year makes sure someone else is one. This
ploy is a favourite but she never could play dead worth a damn, even as
kids. At least after thirty years she&#146;s learned to keep her eyes closed
to avoid the blink reflex. </p>
	  
<p>I lean close, take a deep breath and blow on her face. Her eyelashes
flutter.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;See you downstairs, faker,&#148; I tell her.</p>
	  
<p>Tom&#146;s dead in the hallway, or so he&#146;d like me to think, the clown. I
have to admire the detail: all his clothes on backwards, even the shoes,
which is a pretty good touch. I&#146;d almost believe his head <i>had</i>
been twisted around to face backwards, if we didn&#146;t go through some
variation on this rigmarole every year.</p>
	  
<p>My specs aren&#146;t in the bathroom either, so I have to aim hopefully.
</p>  
	  
<p>&#147;Excuse me, Tom,&#148; I say as I step over him to go downstairs, cistern
gurgling behind me. </p>
	  
<p>In the lounge, there&#146;s blood <i>everywhere</i>. At least, that&#146;s how
it looks to my 02-20 vision. </p>
	  
<p>&#147;Keep it up as long as you want, guys,&#148; I call. Let&#146;s see how long
they maintain the pretence when the frying starts, shall we? Better
still, when the tea is brewing... </p>
	  
<p>I pick my way through to the kitchen, trying to avoid the puddles
soaking into the carpet. It&#146;s a long way to go for a prank, but who am I
to moan? It&#146;s not my house, not my cleaning bill. But they get me via my
compromised vision when some spatter I overlooked slides under my foot,
oily and warm. &#147;Gross,&#148; I moan, and peel the sock off, tossing it at the
TV without looking any closer.</p>
	  
<p>The kitchen floor is cold against my bare sole. I flick on the
kettle, get a mug down from the shelf and toss in a teabag from the tin.
I grab the milk from the fridge door, and a carton of eggs and two packs
of bacon from behind the fake Edward head, which I presume to
be&#151;appropriately enough&#151;a decorated cabbage. Not very convincingly done,
as far as I can see. </p>
	  
<p>Which isn't far, admittedly.</p>
	  
<p>I clatter a frying pan out from the back of the cupboard and stick it
on the heat with just a splash of oil. The steaming kettle clicks and I
pour, splash the milk in early the way I like&#151;Joanie would spit&#151;then I
tear the bacon open and drop in the first four rashers. It's like an
instant round of applause floods the kitchen.</p>
	  
<p>While the bacon sizzles I check in the pantry and find half-empty
bottles of HP and Heinz. Can&#146;t believe Joanie and Duncan only have white
bread though. Hands full, I nudge the pantry door shut with my knee&#151;and
<i>that&#146;s</i> when I notice the doubly hazy figure, beyond the frosted
glass door to the back garden. That must be Dunc. Short-sighted as I am,
it&#146;s obvious he&#146;s wearing something on his head. I roll my eyes, then
grip the bread bag in my teeth and open the door.</p>
	  
<p>It&#146;s a Tim Curry-style demon mask: curling fibreglass horns, matching
red body paint, furry loincloth, fangs, the lot. Nice try, dickhead.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;Have you got my glasses?&#148; I mumble through gritted teeth and
plastic.</p>
	  
<p>&#147;FEEL you yet the TORMENT of the EONS?&#148; Duncan booms from atop
disguised high-heels, gesticulating like the talented kid in a school
play. &#147;SUFFERING in a CEASELESS INSTANT, WAITING for YOUR turn to
DIE?&#148;</p>
	  
<p><i>Pffft</i>. &#147;You should have let Edward do it,&#148; I tell him, &#147;your
acting sucks,&#148; and I shut the door in his face. It&#146;s not locked or
anything, he can come in when he&#146;s ready to give it up. I head back to
the crackling pan and lay out slices of bread on the work surface. </p>
	  
<p>&#147;Do you want brown sauce or tomato?&#148; I call, but he doesn&#146;t answer,
the moody bugger, and I squirt a splodge each on to the halves of my
sandwich-to-be. I flip the bacon over with a wooden spoon from the
pottery jug, mouth watering as I do, then I fish the teabag out of my
mug and drop it in the sink. </p>
	  
<p>And then, just for a moment, I feel weird and dizzy&#151;enough that I
have to lean on the counter to steady myself. Like when you're reading
in the back of a car and it does a lazy swerve. </p>
	  
<p>But just as quick it's gone. Must be the missing specs. I didn&#146;t
drink that much and I&#146;ve got no hangover, but I never go without my
glasses if I can help it. When Joanie finally comes down she&#146;d better
have them on her.</p>
	  
<p>To help recover I take my mug and a loud slurp of
tea&#151;<i>bliss</i>&#151;while I wait for the bacon to blacken. The tasty scent
fills the kitchen and, I have to say, this is almost the best bit,
really. The anticipation. As good as the eating. I&#146;ll do the eggs in the
fat when it&#146;s done. Lovely. </p>
	  
<p>I take another sip of tea. The mug looks as full as the moment I
poured it. </p>
	  
<p>A nice, hot brew: the very definition of English Heaven.</p>
	  
<p>I could do this forever.</p>
