<div><i>A very early (1809) piece of tongue-in-cheek sf by the author of
Sleepy Hollow and Rip van Winkle (from Knickerbocker's History)</i>
<p class=drop>What right had the first discoverers of America to land and
take possession of a country, without first gaining the consent
of its inhabitants, or yielding them an adequate compensation
for their territory? - a question which has withstood many
fierce assaults, and has given much distress of mind to mulitudes
of kind-hearted folk. And indeed, until it be totally
vanquished, and put to rest, the worthy people of America can
by no means enjoy the soil they inhabit, with clear right and
title, and unsullied consciences. <P>The first source of right, by which property is acquired in a
 country, is DISCOVERY. For as all mankind have an equal right
 to any thing, which has never before been appropriated, so
 any nation, that discovers an uninhabited country, and takes
 possession thereof, is considered as enjoying full property, and
 absolute, unquestionable empire therein.
  
This proposition being admitted, it follows clearly, that the
Europeans who first visited America, were the real discoverers
of  the same; nothing being necessary to the establishment of
this fact, but simply to prove that it was totally uninhabited
by man. This would at first appear to be a point of some
difficulty, for it is well known, that this quarter of the world
abounded with certain animals, that walked erect on two feet,
had something of the human countenance, uttered certain
unintelligible sounds, very much like language, in short, had a
marvellous resemblance to human beings. <P>But the zealous and enlightened fathers, who accompanied
the discoverers, plainly proved (and as there were no Indian
writers arose on the other side, the fact was considered as
fully admitted and established) that the two-legged race of
animals before mentioned were mere cannibals, detestable
monsters, and many of them giants - which last description of
vagrants have, since the times of Gog, Magog, and Goliath,
been considered as outlaws, and have received no quarter in
either history, chivalry, or song.
			
This right of discovery being fully established, we now
come to the next, which is the right acquired by CULTIVATION.
Now it is notorious, that the savages knew nothing of agriculture, when first discovered by the Europeans, but lived a
most vagabond, disorderly, unrighteous life - rambling from
place to place, and prodigally rioting upon the spontaneous
luxuries of nature, without tasking her generosity to yield
them anything more; whereas it has been most unquestionably shown, that Heaven intended the earth should be
ploughed and sown, and manured, and laid out into cities, and
towns, and farms, and country seats, and pleasure grounds,
and public gardens, all which the Indians knew nothing about
- therefore, they did not improve the talents Providence had
bestowed on them - therefore, they were careless stewards - 
therefore, they had no right to the soil - therefore, they
deserved to be exterminated. <P>It is true, the savages might plead that they drew all the
benefits from the land which their simple wants required - 
they found plenty of game to hunt, which, together with the
roots and uncultivated fruits of the earth, furnished a sufficient
variety for their frugal repasts; and that as Heaven  merely 
designed the earth to form the abode, and satisfy the
wants of man, so long as these purposes were answered, the
will of Heaven was accomplished. But this only proves how
undeserving they were of the blessings around them - they
were so much the more savages, for not having more wants;
for knowledge is in some degree an increase of desires, and it
is this superiority both in the number and magnitude of his
desires, that distinguishes the man from the beast <P>
But a more irresistible right than either that I have mentioned,
and one which will be the most readily admitted by my reader,
provided he be blessed with bowels of charity and
philanthropy, is the right acquired by CIVILIZATION. All the
world knows the lamentable state in which these poor savages
were found. Not only deficient in the comforts of life, but
what is still worse, most piteously and unfortunately blind to
the miseries of their situation. But no sooner did the benevolent 
inhabitants of Europe behold their sad condition than they 
immediately went to work to ameliorate and improve it
They introduced among them rum, gin, brandy, and the other
comforts of life - and it is astonishing to read how soon the
poor savages learned to estimate those blessings; they likewise
made known to them a thousand remedies, by which the most
inveterate diseases are alleviated and healed; and that they
might comprehend the benefits and enjoy the comforts of
these medicines, they previously introduced among them the
diseases which they were calculated to cure. <P>But the most important branch of civilization, and which
has most strenuously been extolled by the zealous and pious
fathers of the Romish Church, is the introduction of the
Christian faith. It was truly a sight that might well inspire
horror, to behold these savages tumbling among the dark
mountains of paganism, and guilty of the most horrible ignorance 
of religion. It is true, they neither stole nor defrauded;
they were sober, frugal, continent, and faithful to their word;
but though they acted right habitually, it was all in vain,
unless they acted so from precept. The newcomers, therefore,
used every method to induce them to embrace and practise the
true religion - except indeed that of setting them the example. <P>Here then are three complete and undeniable sources of
right established, any one of which was more than ample to
establish a property in the newly-discovered regions of
America. Now, so it has happened in certain parts of this
delightful quarter of the globe, that the right of discovery has
been so strenuously asserted - the influence of cultivation so
industriously extended, and the progress of salvation and civilization so zealously prosecuted, that, what with their attendant 
wars, persecutions, oppressions, diseases and other
partial evils that often hang on the skirts of great benefits - 
the savage aborigines have, somehow or another, been utterly
annihilated - and this all at once brings me to a fourth right, which
is worth all the others put together: the RIGHT BY EXTERMINATION, 
or in other .words, the RIGHT BY GUN-POWDER. <P>But as argument is never so well understood by us selfish
mortals as when it comes home to ourselves, and as I am
particularly anxious that this question should be put to rest
forever, I will suppose a parallel case, by way of arousing the
candid attention of my readers. <P>Let us suppose, then, that the inhabitants of the moon, by
astonishing advancement in science, and by profound insight
into that lunar philosophy, the mere flickerings of which have
of late years dazzled the feeble optics, and addled the shallow
brains of the good people of our globe - let us suppose, I say,
that the inhabitants of the moon, by these means, had arrived
at such a command of their energies, such an enviable state of
perfectibility, as to control the elements, and navigate the
boundless regions of space. Let us suppose a roving crew of
these soaring philosophers, in the course of an aerial voyage
of discovery among the stars, should chance to alight upon
this outlandish planet. <P>And here I beg my readers will not have the uncharitableness 
to smile, as is too frequently the fault of volatile readers,
when perusing the grave speculations of philosophers. I am
far from indulging in any sportive vein at present; nor is the
supposition I have been making so wild as many may deem it.
It has long been a very serious and anxious question with me,
and many a time and oft, in the course of my overwhelming
cares and contrivances for the welfare and protection of this
my native planet, have I lain awake whole nights debating in
my mind, whether it were most probable we should first
discover and civilize the moon, or the moon discover and
civilize our globe. Neither would the prodigy of sailing in the
air and cruising among the stars be a whit more astonishing
and incomprehensible to us, than was the European mystery
of navigating floating castles, through the world of waters, to
the simple natives. We have already discovered the art of
coasting along the aerial shores of our planet, by means of
balloons, as the savages had of venturing along their sea
coasts in canoes; and the disparity between the former, and
the aerial vehicles of the philosophers from the moon, might
not be greater than that between the bark canoes of the
savages, and the mighty ships of their discoverers. <P>To return then to my supposition - let us suppose that the
aerial visitants I have mentioned, possessed of vastly superior
knowledge to ourselves; that is to say, possessed of superior
knowledge in the art of extermination - riding on hyppogriffs
- defended with impenetrable armour - armed with concentrated sunbeams, and provided with vast engines, to hurl
enormous moon-stones: in short, let us suppose them, if our
vanity will permit the supposition, as superior to us in knowledge, and consequently in power, as the Europeans were to
the Indians, when they first discovered them. All this is very
possible; it is only our self-sufficiency that makes us think
otherwise; and I warrant the poor savages, before they had
any knowledge of the white men, armed in all the terrors of
glittering steel and tremendous gunpowder, were as perfectly
convinced that they themselves were the wisest, the most
virtuous, powerful, and perfect of created beings, as are, at
this present moment, the lordly inhabitants of old England, 
the volatile populace of France, or even the self-satisfied
citizens of this most enlightened republic. <P>Let us suppose, moreover, that the aerial voyagers, finding
this planet to be nothing but a howling wilderness, inhabited
by us, poor savages and wild beasts, shall take formal possession
of it, in the name of his most gracious and philosophic
excellency, the man in the moon. Finding, however, that their
numbers are incompetent to hold it in complete subjection, on
account of the ferocious barbarity of its inhabitants, they shall
take our worthy President, the King of England, the Emperor
of Hayti, the mighty Bonaparte, and the great King of
Bantam, and returning to their native planet, shall carry them
to court, as were the Indian chiefs led about as spectacles in
the courts of Europe. <P>
Then making such obeisance as the etiquette of the court
requires, they shall address the puissant man in the moon, in,
as near as I can conjecture, the following terms:               : <P>
"Most serene and mighty Potentate, whose dominions extend
as far as the eye can reach, who rideth on the Great Bear, 
useth the sun as a looking-glass, and maintaineth unrivalled
control over tides, madmen, and sea-crabs. We thy liege
subjects have just returned from a voyage of discovery, in .the
course of which we have landed and taken possession of that
obscure little dirty planet, which thou beholdest rolling at a
distance. The five uncouth monsters, which we have brought 
into this august presence, were once very important chiefs 
among their fellow savages, who are a race of beings totally
destitute of the common attributes of humanity; and differing
in every thing from the inhabitants of the moon, inasmuch as
they carry their heads upon their shoulders, instead of under
their arms - have two eyes instead of one - are utterly destitute
of tails, and of a variety of unseemly complexions, particularly 
of horrible whiteness - instead of pea-green. <P>"We have moreover found these miserable savages sunk
into a state of the utmost ignorance and depravity, every man
shamelessly living with his own wife, and rearing his own
children, instead of indulging in that community of wives
enjoined by the law of nature, as expounded by the philosophers 
of the moon. In a word, they have scarcely a gleam of
true philosophy among them, but are, in fact, utter heretics,
ignoramuses, and barbarians. Taking compassion, therefore,
on the sad condition of these sublunary wretches, we have
endeavoured, while we remained on their planet, to introduce
among them the light of reason - and the comforts of the
moon. We have treated them to mouthfuls of moonshine, and
draughts of nitrous oxide, which they swallowed with incredible 
voracity, particularly the females; and we have likewise 
endeavoured to instil into them the precepts of lunar
philosophy. We have insisted upon their renouncing the 
contemptible shackles of religion and common sense, and adoring
the profound, omnipotent, and all perfect energy, and the
ecstatic, immutable, immovable perfection. But such was the
unparalleled obstinacy of these wretched savages, that they
persisted in cleaving to their wives, and adhering to their
religion, and absolutely set at naught the sublime doctrines
of the moon - nay, among other abominable heresies, they
even went so far as blasphemously to declare, that this
ineffable planet was made of nothing more nor less than green
cheese!" <P>At these words, the great man in the moon (being a very
profound philosopher) shall fall into a terrible passion, and
possessing equal authority over things that do not belong to
him, as did whilom his holiness the Pope, shall forthwith issue
a formidable bull, specifying, "That, whereas a certain crew of
Lunatics have lately discovered, and taken possession of a
newly discovered planet called the earth - and that whereas it
is inhabited by none but a race of two-legged animals that
carry their heads on their shoulders instead of under their
arms; cannot talk the lunatic language; have two eyes instead 
of one; are destitute of tails, and of a horrible whiteness,
instead of pea-green - therefore, and for a variety of other
excellent reasons, they are considered incapable of possessing
any property in the planet they infest, and the right and title
to it are confirmed to its original discoverers. And furthermore, 
the colonists who are now about to depart to the aforesaid 
planet are authorized and commanded to use every means
to convert these infidel savages from the darkness of
Christianity, and make them thorough and absolute lunatics." <P>In consequence of this benevolent bull, our philosophic
benefactors go to work with hearty zeal. They seize upon our
fertile territories, scourge us from our rightful possessions,
relieve us from our wives, and when we are unreasonable
enough to complain, they will turn upon us and say, "Miserable 
barbarians! Ungrateful wretches! Have we not come thousands
of miles to improve your worthless planet; have we not fed you
with moonshine; have we not intoxicated you with nitrous oxide;
does not our moon give you light every night, and have you the
baseness to murmur, when we claim a pitiful return for all these 
benefits?" <P>
But finding that we not only persist in absolute contempt of
their reasoning and disbelief in their philosophy, but even go
so far as daringly to defend our property, their patience shall
be exhausted, and they shall resort to their superior powers of
argument; hunt us with hyppogriffs, transfix us with concentrated
sunbeams, demolish our cities with moon-stones; until having, 
by main force, converted us to the true faith, they shall graciously 
permit us to exist in the torrid deserts of Arabia, or the frozen regions
of Lapland, there to enjoy the charms of lunar philosophy, in much
the same manner as the reformed and enlightened savages of this
country are kindly suffered to inhabit the inhospitable forests of the 
north, or the impenetrable wildernesses of South America. <P>Thus, I hope, I have clearly proved, and strikingly illustrated, the right
of the early colonists to the possession of this country; and thus is 
this gigantic question completely vanquished.
