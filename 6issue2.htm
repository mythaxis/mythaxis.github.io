<div align=center><img src="lucian.jpg"><BR><h2>Voyage to the Moon</h2><BR><h3>Lucian (Loukianos)</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>Lucian was a Syrian author, born about the year 120 AD.
This translation is by Thomas Francklin, an English cleric, in the 
eighteenth century. 
Just a short extract from Lucian's early work in the sf field. He refreshingly
confessed to being a liar, which boast, I feel, is amply borne out. The tale, which runs
to a very large number of words, is characterised by a very lively imagination, assisted
by Greek mythology and Homeric sagas, as
you will see, and forms the origin of many later fantasies from Bergerac to Swift.<br /><br /> 
<small>Underlined sections deliver a pop-up commentary.</small></i>
<P class=drop>We left them 
<u onmouseover="Tip('We join Lucian somewhat after his' +
' courageous departure from the Mediterranean' +
' into the Atlantic Ocean, then an entirely' +
' unknown quantity. Ed. ')">and returned to our companions in the ship.</u>
  We then
took our casks, filled some of them with water, and some with wine
from the river, slept one night on shore, and the next morning set
sail, the wind being very moderate.  About noon, the island being
now out of sight, on a sudden a most violent whirlwind arose, and
carried the ship above three thousand stadia, lifting it up above
the water, from whence it did not let us down again into the seas
but kept us suspended in mid air, in this manner we hung for
seven days and nights, and on the eighth beheld a large tract of
land, like an island, round, shining, and remarkably full of
light; we got on shore, and found on examination that it was
cultivated and full of inhabitants, though we could not then see any
of them.  As night came on other islands appeared, some large,
others small, and of a fiery colour; there was also below these
another land with seas, woods, mountains, and cities in it, and this
we took to be our native country:  as we were advancing forwards, we
were seized on a sudden by the Hippogypi, for so it seems they
were called by the inhabitants; these Hippogypi are men carried upon
vultures, which they ride as we do horses.  These vultures have each
three heads, and are immensely large; you may judge of their size
when I tell you that one of their feathers is bigger than the mast
of a ship.  The Hippogypi have orders, it seems, to fly round the
kingdom, and if they find any stranger, to bring him to the king:
they took us therefore, and carried us before him.  As soon as he
saw us, he guessed by our garb what we were.   <P>"You are Grecians,"	said he, "are you not?"   <P>We told him we were.   <P>"And how," added he,
"got ye hither through the air?"   <P>We told him everything that had
happened to us; and he, in return, related to us his own history,
and informed us, that he also was a man, that his name was Endymion,
that he had been taken away from our earth in his sleep, and
brought to this place where he reigned as sovereign.  That spot,
he told us, which now looked like a moon to us, <u onmouseover="Tip('Advanced thinking for the time')"> was the earth</u>.
He desired us withal not to make ourselves uneasy, for that we
should soon have everything we wanted.  "If I succeed," says he, "in
the war which I am now engaged in against the inhabitants of the
sun, you will be very happy here."   <P>We asked him then what enemies
he had, and what the quarrel was about?   <P>"Phaeton," he replied, "who
is king of the sun (<u onmouseover="Tip('The 1780 translator, while prepared'+
' to believe inhabitants on the moon,'+
' doubts whether the sun is habitable.')">for that is inhabited as well as the
moon</u>), has been at war with us for some time past.  The foundation
of it was this:  I had formerly an intention of sending some of the
poorest of my subjects to establish a colony in Lucifer, which was
uninhabited:  but Phaeton, out of envy, put a stop to it, by
opposing me in the mid-way with his Hippomyrmices; we were
overcome and desisted, our forces at that time being unequal to
theirs.  I have now, however, resolved to renew the war and fix my
colony; if you have a mind, you shall accompany us in the
expedition; I will furnish you everyone with a royal vulture and
other accoutrements; we shall set out to-morrow."   <P>"With all my
heart," said I, "whenever you please."   <P><p class=drop>We stayed, however, and
supped with him; and rising early the next day, proceeded with the
army, when the spies gave us notice that the enemy was approaching.
The army consisted of a hundred thousand, besides the scouts and
engineers, together with the auxiliaries, amongst whom were eighty
thousand Hippogypi, and twenty thousand who were mounted on the
Lachanopteri; these are very large birds, whose feathers are
of a kind of herb, and whose wings look like lettuces.  Next to
these stood the <u onmouseover="Tip('Millet throwers')"> Cinchroboli</u>, 
and the <u onmouseover="Tip('Garlic warriors')">Schorodomachi</u>. Our
allies from the north were three thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Flea archers')">Psyllotoxotae</u> and
five thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Wind runners')">Anemodromi</u>; the former take their names from the
fleas which they ride upon, every flea being as big as twelve
elephants; the latter are foot-soldiers, and are carried about in
the air without wings, in this manner:  they have large gowns
hanging down to their feet, these they tuck up and spread in a form
of a sail, and the wind drives them about like so many boats:  in
the battle they generally wear targets.  It was reported that
seventy thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Acorn sparrows')">Strathobalani</u> from the stars over Cappadocia
were to be there, together with five thousand <u onmouseover="Tip('Horse cranes')">Hippogerani</u>; 
these I did not see, for they never came:  I shall not attempt,
therefore, to describe them; of these, however, most wonderful
things were related. <P>Such were the forces of Endymion; their arms were all alike; their
helmets were made of beans, for they have beans there of a
prodigious size and strength, and their scaly breast-plates of
lupines sewed together, for the skins of their lupines are like a
horn, and impenetrable; their shields and swords the same as our
own. <P><div class=pullquote>they use shields made of
mushrooms, and spears of the stalks of asparagus</div>The army ranged themselves in this manner:  the right wing was
formed by the Hippogypi, with the king, and round him his chosen
band to protect him, amongst which we were admitted; on the left
were the Lachanopteri; the auxiliaries in the middle, the foot were
in all about sixty thousand myriads.  They have spiders, you must
know, in this country, in infinite numbers, and of pretty large
dimensions, each of them being as big as one of the islands of the
Cyclades; these were ordered to cover the air from the moon quite to
the morning star; this being immediately done, and the field of
battle prepared, the infantry was drawn up under the command of
Nycterion, the son of Eudianax. <P>The left wing of the enemy, which was commanded by Phaeton himself,
consisted of the Hippomyrmices; these are large birds, and resemble
our ants, except with regard to size, the largest of them covering
two acres; these fight with their horns and were in number about
fifty thousand.  In the right wing were the <u onmouseover="Tip('Air flies')">Aeroconopes</u>, about
five thousand, all archers, and riding upon large gnats.  To these
succeeded the <u onmouseover="Tip('Air dancers')">Aerocoraces</u>, light infantry, but remarkably
brave and useful warriors, for they threw out of slings exceeding
large radishes, which whoever was struck by, died immediately, a
most horrid stench exhaling from the wound; they are said, indeed,
to dip their arrows in a poisonous kind of mallow.  Behind these
stood ten thousand Caulomycetes, heavy-armed soldiers, who
fight hand to hand; so called because they use shields made of
mushrooms, and spears of the stalks of asparagus.  Near them were
placed the Cynobalani, about five thousand, who were sent by
the inhabitants of Sirius; these were men with dog's heads, and
mounted upon winged acorns:  some of their forces did not arrive in
time; amongst whom there were to have been some slingers from the
Milky-way, together with the <u onmouseover="Tip('Cloud centaurs')">Nephelocentauri</u>; they indeed came
when the first battle was over, and I wish they had never come
at all:  the slingers did not appear, which, they say, so enraged
Phaeton that he set their city on fire. <P>Thus prepared, the enemy began the attack:  the signal being given,
and the asses braying on each side, for such are the trumpeters they
make use of on these occasions, the left wing of the Heliots, unable
to sustain the onset of our Hippogypi, soon gave way, and we pursued
them with great slaughter:  their right wing, however, overcame our
left.  The Aeroconopes falling upon us with astonishing force, and
advancing even to our infantry, by their assistance we recovered;
and they now began to retreat, when they found the left wing had
been beaten.  The defeat then becoming general, many of them were
taken prisoners and many slain; the blood flowed in such abundance
that the clouds were tinged with it and looked red, just as they
appear to us at sunset; from thence it distilled through upon the
earth.  Some such thing, I suppose, happened formerly amongst the
gods, which made Homer believe that Jove rained blood at the
death of Sarpedon. <P><p class=drop>When we returned from our pursuit of the enemy we set up two
trophies; one, on account of the infantry engagement in the spider's
web, and another in the clouds, for our battle in the air.  Thus
prosperously everything went on, when our spies informed us that the
Nephelocentaurs, who should have been with Phaeton before the
battle, were just arrived:  they made, indeed, as they approached
towards us, a most formidable appearance, being half winged horses
and half men; the men from the waist upwards, about as big as the
Rhodian Colossus, and the horses of the size of a common ship of
burthen.  I have not mentioned the number of them, which was really
so great, that it would appear incredible:  they were commanded by
Sagittarius, from the Zodiac.  As soon as they learned that
their friends had been defeated they sent a message to Phaeton to
call him back, whilst they put their forces into order of battle,
and immediately fell upon the <u onmouseover="Tip('Moon-dwellers. H.G.Wells used the same term for his moon people')">Selenites</u>, who were unprepared
to resist them, being all employed in the division of the spoil;
they soon put them to flight, pursued the king quite to his own
city, and slew the greatest part of his birds; they then tore down
the trophies, ran over all the field woven by the spiders, and
seized me and two of my companions.  Phaeton at length coming up,
they raised other trophies for themselves; as for us, we were
carried that very day to the palace of the Sun, our hands bound
behind us by a cord of the spider's web. <P>The conquerors determined not to besiege the city of the Moon, but
when they returned home, resolved to build a wall between them and
the Sun, that his rays might not shine upon it; this wall was double
and made of thick clouds, so that the moon was always eclipsed, and
in perpetual darkness.  Endymion, sorely distressed at these
calamities, sent an embassy, humbly beseeching them to pull down the
wall, and not to leave him in utter darkness, promising to pay them
tribute, to assist them with his forces, and never more to rebel; he
sent hostages withal.  Phaeton called two councils on the affair, at
the first of which they were all inexorable, but at the second
changed their opinion; a treaty at length was agreed to on these
conditions: <P><i>The Heliots and their allies on one part, make the following
agreement with the Selenites and their allies on the other:<b> "That
the Heliots shall demolish the wall now erected between them, that
they shall make no irruptions into the territories of the Moon; and
restore the prisoners according to certain articles of ransom to be
stipulated concerning them; that the Selenites shall permit all the
other stars to enjoy their rights and privileges; that they shall
never wage war with the Heliots, but assist them whenever they shall
be invaded; that the king of the Selenites shall pay to the king of
the Heliots an annual tribute of ten thousand casks of dew, for the
insurance of which, he shall send ten thousand hostages; that they
shall mutually send out a colony to the Morning-star, in which,
whoever of either nation shall think proper, may become a member;
that the treaty shall be inscribed on a column of amber, in the
midst of the air, and on the borders of the two kingdoms.  This
treaty was sworn to on the part of the Heliots, by Pyronides,
and Therites, and Phlogius; and on the part of the Selenites, by
Nyctor, and Menarus, and Polylampus."</b></i> <P>Such was the peace made between them; the wall was immediately
pulled down, and we were set at liberty.  When we returned to the
Moon, our companions met and embraced us, shedding tears of joy, as
did Endymion also.  He intreated us to remain there, or to go along
with the new colony; this I could by no means be persuaded to, but
begged he would let us down into the sea.  As he found I could not
be prevailed on to stay, after feasting us most nobly for seven
days, he dismissed us. <P>I will now tell you every thing which I met with in the Moon that
was new and extraordinary.  Amongst them, when a man grows old he
does not die, but dissolves into smoke and turns to air.  They all
eat the same food, which is frogs roasted on the ashes from a large
fire; of these they have plenty which fly about in the air, they get
together over the coals, snuff up the scent of them, and this serves
them for victuals.  Their drink is air squeezed into a cup, which
produces a kind of dew. <P>He who is quite bald is esteemed a beauty amongst them, for they
abominate long hair; whereas, in the comets, it is looked upon as a
perfection at least; so we heard from some strangers who were
speaking of them; they have, notwithstanding, small beards a little
above the knee; no nails to their feet, and only one great toe.
They have honey here which is extremely sharp, and when they
exercise themselves, wash their bodies with milk; this, mixed with a
little of their honey, makes excellent cheese. Their oil is
extracted from onions, is very rich, and smells like ointment.
Their wines, which are in great abundance, yield water, and the
grape stones are like hail; I imagine, indeed, that whenever the
wind shakes their vines and bursts the grape, then comes down
amongst us what we call hail.  They make use of their belly, which
they can open and shut as they please, as a kind of bag, or pouch,
to put anything in they want; it has no liver or intestines, but is
hairy and warm within, insomuch, that new-born children, when they
are cold, frequently creep into it.  The garments of the rich
amongst them are made of glass, but very soft:  the poor have woven
brass, which they have here in great abundance, and by pouring a
little water over it, so manage as to card it like wool.  I am
afraid to mention their eyes, lest, from the incredibility of the
thing, you should not believe me.  I must, however, inform you that
they have eyes which they take in and out whenever they please:  so
that they can preserve them anywhere till occasion serves, and then
make use of them; many who have lost their own, borrow from others;
and there are several rich men who keep a stock of eyes by them.
Their ears are made of the leaves of plane-trees, except of those
who spring, as I observed to you, from acorns, these alone have
wooden ones.  I saw likewise another very extraordinary thing in the
king's palace, which was a looking-glass that is placed in a well
not very deep; whoever goes down into the well hears everything that
is said upon earth, and if he looks into the glass, beholds all the
cities and nations of the world as plain as if he was close to them.
I myself saw several of my friends there, and my whole native
country; whether they saw me also I will not pretend to affirm.  He
who does not believe these things, whenever he goes there will know
that I have said nothing but what is true. <P>To return to our voyage.  We took our leave of the king and his
friends, got on board our ship, and set sail.  Endymion made me a
present of two glass robes, two brass ones, and a whole coat of
armour made of lupines, <u onmouseover="Tip('He refers here to a later adventure')">all which I left in the whale's belly</u>.
He likewise sent with us a thousand Hippogypi, who escorted us five
hundred stadia. <P>We sailed by several places, and at length reached the new colony of
the Morning-star, where we landed and took in water; from thence we
steered into the Zodiac; leaving the Sun on our left, we passed
close by his territory, and would have gone ashore, many of our
companions being very desirous of it, but the wind would not permit
us; we had a view, however, of that region, and perceived that it
was green, fertile, and well-watered, and abounding in everything
necessary and agreeable.  The Nephelocentaurs, who are mercenaries
in the service of Phaeton, saw us and flew aboard our ship, but,
recollecting that we were included into the treaty, soon departed;
the Hippogypi likewise took their leave of us. <P><small> End of Extract</small>
