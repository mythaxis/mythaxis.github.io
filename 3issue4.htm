<div><i>An epic fragment from Jonathan Joseph's <a href="http://www.kilbot.co.uk"
target=_blank><b>Workspace</b></a> blog.</i>
<p class=drop>Janahara Azad hates his job, his boss, and
his exo-suit, in that order. The first is unavoidable, the second
repellent, and the third tetchy, recalcitrant and intermittently
cooperative. <P>Three hours into an 18 hour shift: Madhom Bibir Hat averages 98%
humidity, 42 Celsius, and is mercilessly lit by a diffuse sun which
glints dully off the eternal mud. On the outskirts of the breaking yard
itself, for all the surrealism of the monstrous dead tech
littering the landscape and the insane levels of activity in the main
yard, it is a curiously peaceful place. A gentle wind blows a damp
breath on the machang shanty town that presses hard against
the yard perimeter. Naked toddlers play in the dust, tugging improbably
sized mech-scrap behind them like mute pets; groups of women in faded
sarees chat quietly in small groups by the compound gates. Appearances
aside, Madhom, like almost all places, has to be a home as well.
 
Nearly everything at Madhom suffers from scalar inferiority. Even the
biggest, brashest, blingest vehicle that rolls into the yard, pinging
metal betraying the speed of its trip from the Dhaka suburbs, is utterly
dwarfed by the giant metal corpses that dominate not only the skyline,
but the eyeline, the foreground and every other perspective. Blossoming
like a sooty flower in the wake of the global commerce combine, Madhom
is the epicentre of dead tech disposal in the third decade of the
twenty-first century. Historically, Madhom was a dumping ground for
unwanted merchant shipping tonnage, giant ships were rolled straight up
onto the gently sloping beaches, the salty air filled with a constant
undignified, wheezing, diesel swansong, then picked apart by swarming
groups of tiny brown figures, none with their full complement of fingers
or any discernible safety gear.  <P><div=pullquote>It is during a particularly difficult removal of the buckled inner
airlock door that the accident happens</div>After decades of crunching huge ships into easily recyclable chunks,
powered by greed, blinkered convenience and a seemingly inexhaustible
supply of uncomplaining Bangladeshi men who would rather work and die
than just die, Madhom Bibir Hat in Chittagong is now the place for the
disposal of vast metal structures of all shapes and purposes. Most
recently, The Kashem Corporation, Janahara's employer, has moved into platform recycling. Winning a
lucrative, yet laughably small by Western standards, contract from
IDMessina Group (a WorkSpace subsidiary) in 2025, Kashem Corp now processes three to four redundant
oceanic oil drilling platforms per year. Despite a mortality rate of
nearly one hundred and fifty men per platform, and constant wrangling
with UN pollution inspection personnel, Kashem's owner Iqbal Karim
manages to maintain houses in nine capitals, a fleet of hydrogen-powered
Bentleys, and no minimum wage.  <P>Janahara works on commission, a paltry algorithm based on how much metal
his aging SARCOS exo-suit can gouge and chew from whichever rapidly
skeletonising steel carcass has most recently beached itself on the
desolate mud flats of the Bay of Bengal.  Janahara's suit, whilst
over fifteen years old and desperately in need of an overhaul, is
critical to his job. His SARCOS suit is a carapaced, hot-zone variant,
built in 2010 and designed for operation in NBC active zones; it is
ideally suited, when cooperative, to (slowly) reducing a million tons of
steel and assorted exotic materials into loads that will fit in the
flatbed of an Isuzu pickup. After demob in 2017 the suit was purchased
by a Scottish construction 
collective and retrofitted with a first generation  mobile AI. Barely
rating a sentience designation, and never upgraded, the suit has all the
intellectual finesse of a mongrel mutt displaced from its place by the
fireside, with a conversational repertoire to match. The suit is
eighth-hand to Janahara, and had never operated south of the equator
before Janahara slipped into its worn vinyl interior. Presumably it was
nice and warm for its northern operators, but its air conditioning
condenser has long since rotted away
and Janahara suffers miserably in the noonday sun of Madhom beach.
 
For the hundredth time this shift
Janahara wipes his face against the stinking towel tied to the defunct
chin monitor in the suit helmet and sucks down more brackish water from
the hamster tube. It is going to be
a long day. <P><p class=drop>Janahara hates it when his boss visits; he sees it as a
fundamental breach of the uneven covenant between boss and crew. Stay
out of sight, you rich fucks. Laughably called the crew lounge (a
notional, nearly derisory, nod to UNEP recommendations), Kashem Corp
provides one small, sixteen square metre plywood break time shack. This
is perched on the boundary between the scrubby Chittagong shoreline and
the endless mud flats at the seaward entrance to the main Madhom
breaking yard; the crews call it, in a rare display of fatigue tinged
irony, the HQ. This small concession is served by a temperamental water
cooler and a wheezing, external aircon unit clumsily bonded to an
outside wall, a ten year old PV solar panel provides the power. Employee
benefits are a new concept in Chittagong and Iqbal (a self-styled
moderniser) is absurdly proud of this nod to modern Western work
practices, but unfortunately the basic genetics of the concept have been
somewhat lost in translation.  Inside, exhausted men, none with a body
mass index greater than ten, are flopped listlessly across several
pieces of broken furniture; sweat-oiled flesh squeaks against ancient
faux leather and a musty, foetid smell floats up from the mouldering
hide of a Chesterfield. Iqbal is expected at 1400 and has ordered
Janahara's team and two other crews to be present when he arrives,
fifteen men in total. Apparently, he has an announcement to make, the
men don't give a shit, any chance for a break is totally
exploited. Janahara parks his suit on
the makeshift veranda outside HQ, the SARCOS suit slumping corpse-like
on top of other discarded exo-suits - a latter day charnel pit, the
stench of sweat and hydraulic fluid replacing the ferric tang of blood.  <P>Janahara makes a beeline for the water cooler, the desalinator in HQ
provides considerably superior water to that of the filtered sweat and
urine that the exo-suits synthesise, and he stands chugging litres of
chilled heaven until a trigeminal spike of agony forces him to bend over
at the waist; ice cream headache is a common phenomena at break times in
Madhom. Ice cream isn't. Hydrated, Janahara slumps down in a shattered
garden lounger and waits for his illustrious leader. He gets a few nods
from his colleagues (another Iqbal terminology pretension) but no chat;
team building is generally discouraged at Madhom, mostly to maximise
productivity but also to reduce the risk of revolt. Iqbal Karim, whilst a repulsively obese and
morally bankrupt example of corporate greed, is not stupid. He has
considered the potential result of hundreds of bionically augmented,
terminally pissed-off serfs descending onto the yard management
compound. Iqbal theoretically has net control over the exo-suits, but
Madhom does not have the best record for net coverage uptime and the
huge metal salvage chunks that litter the yard tend to disrupt EM fields.  <P>A muted ululating hum signals the arrival of Iqbal's electric phaeton, a
long pause and protracted huffing, and then the door bangs open,
silhouetting Iqbal's dirigible form in the bright white light of the
Bengalese afternoon. <P>"Asalaam alaykum, men. No need to get up." <P>No one has moved. Iqbal mops at a streaming brow with a mildly scandalous silk
handkerchief; his moonlike face is framed
by the bright orange of his hennaed beard, and 
carries its usual expression of quasi-benevolent irritation.
Iqbal is nearly seventy but wealth and
easy living lends his podgy face a
baby-like smoothness. It is easy not to
like him and only the universally despised simpering orderlies show a fawning obsequiousness. "Special job
today, men. It's a rush job so a bonus is on offer; if you three crews
can decon the job before Saturday then there's a one thousand taka bonus
per man and a one day holiday." <P>Some stirring in the HQ at last, a thousand taka is nearly a week's pay and a day off: unheard of bliss. The
chance to sleep a little, eat leisurely and a maybe a little cricket in
the early evening.  <P>"It's an unusual job; Kashem has successfully bid for recyke on the
primary ISS module. Apparently it's too large for a re-entry cremation
and too risky to shoot down, so they're bringing it in for a splashdown
in the Andaman later this afternoon. One of our tugs will bring it in
first thing in the morning. I presume all you men will be up for it, it
will mean twenty-plus hour shifts for at least three days but, as I
said, there's a bonus. Kashem look after their crews." <P>This last hilarious inaccuracy sours his
self-satisfied momentum a little but the quiet hubbub that breaks out seems
good enough confirmation for Iqbal. He waddles
back towards his conveyance.  "I'll upload your suits with the
necessary schematics in the morning, I suggest you finish your shift
today as quickly as you can and get some rest." <P>A collective groan as bodies are unglued from the terrible furniture,
final glugs of water are swilled down from the cooler: suit internment
begins again. <P><p class=drop>After years of brute demolition, basic rending and
tearing, Janahara's team is learning for the first time (unwillingly but
quickly) the art of incremental, non-destructive deconstruction.  <P>The briefing (another weird new concept) in the management compound at
Madhom had a core message: fuck up the decon and there would be no
bonus. It turns out that reducing an International Space Station life
support module (now Iqbal's casual, urbane reference to the ISS becomes clear) to its component, fiscally
useful, parts and materials was no cakewalk. The sandwich of steel,
Kevlar, ceramics and assorted exotic fabrics which kept the cosmonauts
protected in space only retained its salvage value if it was removed
layer by painstaking layer. To breakers who normally used brute suit
power to reduce ships and platforms to easily sellable scrap, the
thousand taka bonus is starting to look a
little lean.  <P>Iqbal has even gone as far as putting
together a Power Point presentation to ram home the message;
unfortunately he is apparently a novice
with basic office applications and has
saturated each slide with so much swoop-in animation and ambiguous font
choices that it is largely meaningless.
Still, sitting in an aircon office watching their bloated employer
fumbling with the controls of a laser projector beat trudging around in
mud in forty plus, so he had an attentive audience. In the end, though,
it was clear: decon the module, remove the components of the laminate
skin in sheets no smaller than one meter square, try not to get the
pieces muddy, do it by Saturday noon.
 
<p class=drop>So Janahara finds himself, at 1500 on day one of the deconstruction,
working with uncharacteristic finesse inside the nadir airlock of the
ISS module, delicately removing gossamer sheets of Kevlar from the
floor(?)/roof(?) of the structure. It's still horrible, sweaty, endless
work, and as the module is still suspended from the salvage crane that
hoisted it from the tug flatbed, gentle oscillations in the crane cable
means Janahara is suffering from intermittent inner ear nausea. It's not
all bad though. The module offers some shade from the sun and the lack
of gross mechanical movements keeps the fatigue to a manageable level. 
Even Janahara's suit seems to approve, normally gnomically taciturn, it
has actually expressed an opinion about the day's work: "I've got the
greatest enthusiasm and confidence in our work", and has even asked
after Janahara's well being, "How can I help you during this important
transition?", this second comment was a bit random but Janahara still
feels absurdly pleased with his dolt of a partner; he couldn't remember
a time when they had ever conversed about anything but the basic details
of the job at hand. <P>It is during a particularly difficult removal of the buckled inner
airlock door that the accident happens. The module is in a pretty sorry
state after its prolonged soak in the Andaman Sea and kelp and other
oceanic verdants have invaded every possible gap and chink in the warped
structure. Janahara is using a relatively new carbide buzz saw with an
insanely capable RPM rate to cut through the titanium hinges on the
nominally ventral side of the module when the crane cable gives way. A
sickening moment of freefall, a brief warped mirroring of the thousands
of graceful arcs the module had sketched in low earth orbit, the scream
of a runaway power tool, and then a crushing impact as the module concertinas into the compacted mud of the dry
dock. Janahara hears an oof, a muted shriek and a flare of agony in his
legs; then darkness takes him away for a while. <P>ISS modules are built for restraining fifteen bar of internal air
pressure, not load bearing over ten tons of mass at half terminal
velocity. Janahara regains consciousness and enters a world of pain,
heat, atomised seaweed, an Escher house of collapsed bulkheads and the
bleeping complaints of numerous automatic user warranty invalidation
alerts from his suit. He chins the alarm kill switch and takes stock.
Incredible searing pain from both legs: check. Visibility: zero. On
board suit systems: non responsive. Water tank, *suck*: empty. Janahara
slumps back in despair, he's seen a hundred yard accidents, and the
outcome is never good. A worker in Europe would, at about this stage, be
likely to be hearing the wail of emergency service vehicles and the
reassuring voice of a sober foreman. This is Chittagong. All he can hear
is the uninterrupted roar of decon machinery all around and the
impatient shouts of profit temporarily suspended.  He hears the still,
small, calm voice of his suit AI. <P>"Janahara, I can help you." <P>A sharp burning pain in the right side of his chest. A brief, condensed,
hypochondriac moment of heart attack anxiety. Then, only darkness. <P>
<p class=drop>In his short and largely cheerless life, Janahara has
lacked a great many things; regular nourishment, more than one set of
clothes, a semblance of health care,  reliably potable water - to name a
few. Latterly though, he's realising just quite how thoroughly fucked
over he's been. Time itself, it seems, like all luxuries, is also the
preserve of those already benefiting from an existing level of corporeal
comfort. A myopic fixation on the scant privations of hand to mouth
existence does not allow choice, let alone an appreciation of it.
Janahara has never had the luxury of stability, or even a passing
familiarity with the rules by which to play; he has sat all his life in
a grey, dimly lit box which diffused all shadow. Today, he's breaking
out. The pure, annealing light that now fills
Janahara is a revelation of sorts,
but not one he is best placed to
immediately appreciate. His current transformation is largely a pharmacological one, the relief from pain a
result of world class medical intervention. His chapped lips are soothed
by refrigerated Icelandic mineral water, his deeper wounds are dressed
with expensive maggot debridement treatments, a nano salve soothes the abrasions on his left flank, and
both legs are cradled in smartweave, analgesic casts. Heaven, always a
divisive and personal condition, has come
fleetingly to Janahara. Later, as his eyes adjust
to the light, the source begins
to form into a vaguely identifiable shape: a huge window looking out,
from Janahara's prone position, onto a featureless pure blue sky, tiny
white birds flecking the endless azure. His universe is made up of
distilled monochromes; the blue sky, white walls, a whiter bed. He has
no idea of where he is and how he got there. All he knows and cares
about is that he's not at the Madhom yard; he gives into the drugs and
steps out of his body for a while. The doctors fill him in later; he's
got a lot of doctors, he can afford them, in fact, he can afford
whatever he wants.  <P>Earlier that day, seventeen minutes after the accident in the Madhom
yard, a Sikorsky heavy lifter thundered over Chittagong from the
northwest. Without bothering to touch down and ignoring the agog
workers, the flapping management goons and the handshake ping from the
yard security network, the Sikorsky lowered a spectra line and grapple
and simply winched the entire ISS module, Janahara, suit and all, into
the reddening afternoon sky. After eleven minutes of terrifying,
whirling flight, the Sikorsky dumped the module directly onto the
helipad on top of Dhaka National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation
Institute and lit off immediately. Responding to feeble shouts from
within the module hulk, the genteel surgeons of the DNOH were reluctant
at first to rush to the aid of this scabrous (obviously poor) invader
into their sterile enclave, but after a standard scan of his RFID tag
embedded under the skin of his right pectoral, things started to move
much more quickly. Specifically, Janahara became Mr. Azad when his
credit line was queried. He was swiftly shuttled from the public ER bay
to a private side room on the third floor, and from there to a maglev
enabled suite on the twenty-seventh.  Somewhere between being squashed
by several tons of obsolete multi-international space hardware, and
landing in a supersonic clatter of helicopter blades in the centre of
Dhaka, Janahara got rich.

Dear Hadas,<br> Just thought I would drop you a line, BIG news. It's
been a while anyway since we last corresponded and you know how I hate
meeting in the World, a technophobe to the end I suppose.<br> Anyway, my
work on the Azad project goes well; as well it should after three years
of research in six cities and two year-long Lorbital sabbaticals (much
praise to my crawler team as well, of course, and the admin here at
Lhasa is a genius with partials management, and naturally we all love
the bots). Your own contributions to the analysis of Janahara's
WorkSpace acquisition coup (amazing to think that an event nearly forty
years ago still resonates so strongly) continues to benefit us
enormously - so kudos to you too. It's slow work though, what a bloody
paranoiac he is! Janahara Azad has the most infuriatingly incongruous
nodal presence I have ever seen, it's like he's hardly there.
Continuously I have to try and reconcile his huge RL presence with his
"barely a ripple" impact on the net. I mean, come on, he's richer than
gods and most people can draw his face from memory - how does he keep
such a low dunked profile?! Well, this is why I was drawn to the work I
suppose, but what a frustrating enigma.<br> Forensic dead-ends aside
we've had something of a Holy Grail moment here this week. Last Thursday
I received a call from a probate lawyer in Dhaka, gentleman by the name
of Chandra, he said he had something that might interest me (my research
is reasonably well known in that city). Turns out that he had been
anonymously (curiouser and curiouser) sent a number of ancient media
files still in their original substrate (that alone is worth a train
journey to Dhaka; vintage silicon and plastic storage medium -
fascinating) that directly related to Azad's early life in Dhaka, he
intimated that they may even relate to his pre-accelerative life. He
wasn't able to (or wouldn't), offer any details about the provenance of
the files, but Chandra (obviously a typical canny lawyer) sent me a
chunk of one of the converted files as a taster. Well, suffice to say;
yesterday I got back from Dhaka on the maglev after a hectic two days in
Bangladesh. I've now blown the entire department's budget on Chandra's
files (he's no better than a shark TBH, but no matter) - the files are
genuine! I could go on and on about the importance of this find but it
would be easier just to show you. Please see below for a transcript of
what I think is the most important file (I've also attached the
converted file but given the age of the original coding some recipients
have requested a transcript, so I preempted you asking the same.)<br> 
Anyway, read on, tenure is assured, old
friend. Best regards, D.
