<div><i>Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in
creating out of void, but out of chaos. <br><small>Mary Shelley</small></i>
<p class=drop>At the insistence of a second arpeggio of
descending chimes Mosper Belk reluctantly put down his book and shuffled
into the front hall to peer closely at the wall-screen. It displayed in
his doorway the profiled image of an unfamiliar man clad in sombre grey,
apart from a jaunty emerald trim at collar and cuffs. He held a slim
black case. There was a relaxed dignity about his stance which betokened
someone serious and self-assured. Mosper had not been expecting any
weekend callers. Intrigued, he opened the door. <P>&#147;Forgive
disturb, esteemed Belk&#148;, the man announced gravely, with a respectful
nod. &#147;Hulf Atacrast, day-journeyed from Meheric. Fore-message left at
place of work, but Mr Smirt of Greeming and er&#133; Trelph?&#148;  <P>&#147;Trulph.&#148;  <P>&#148;Yes. He tells me they respect your rest-day.&#148; <P>Mosper was not quite sure how to respond to this slightly
contradictory information, offering only a non-committal &#147;Ah,&#148; and
looking politely expectant.  <P>&#147;Meheric Faculty Propulsion,&#148; the
man clarified. &#147;Since eleven years, Research Scrupulator.&#148; He proffered
a holocard for inspection. It confirmed his identity, membership of the
faculty and significant academic credentials in the field of powered
flight theory. Atacrast explained that his was a consultative r&#244;le,
shared with eight others, replacing what used to be known as the
Scrutinizing Committee.  <P>Mosper felt an unexpected pang of
nostalgia at this reminder of his own earlier career. &#147;So we have a
common interest. I see you spent some time at the Wotzl Foundation. Even
here in Snoak it has a fine reputation for being at the forefront of
aeronautical development. The Institute in Meheric of course I used to
know well, though I doubt whether any of the people I worked with are
still there. One loses touch as the years pass&#133; Now I content myself
with a bit of general tinkering. The fingers still need to be exercised,
as well as the mind.&#148; He handed back the holocard. &#147;But why have you
come to see me?&#148;  <P>&#147;Ah, venerable sir, with your permit, I
greatly wish discuss with you certain papers, by auspicious accident of
fortune retrieved from rodent nesting site in faculty archives.&#148;
Atacrast tapped his document case.  <P>&#147;The archives? But I thought
they were&#133; Papers? What papers exactly?&#148;  <P>&#147;<i>&#145;Lighter, swifter,
safer: rethinking the airpod engine,&#146; &#145;Dynamics of cloud control,&#146;
&#145;Gyractive isolates and the quest for stability&#146;</i>. Also others
similar,
authorship M Belk, S Corrity, S Crobes, R Hobharp, Senior Airtechs. In
humble opinion Atacrast, important historic work, for much time
ignored&#133;&#148; He lowered his voice confidentially. &#147;I, Atacrast, believe
these documents not supplied for emergency comfort of mice by benevolent
action of caretaker, but with purpose suppressed! Suppressed by person
or people of ignorance or of malice to prevent advancement of
aeronautics.&#148;  <P>Mosper looked momentarily astonished, then sighed
ruefully and gestured to his visitor. &#147;Well, Scrupulator Atacrast, I
think you had better come in.&#148;  <P><p class=drop>Thirty five years earlier Mosper Belk, as a
newly-qualified airtech,
had joined what was then known as the Institute of Aeronautics in
Meheric. He remembered the frisson of anticipation as he was shown into
one of the engineering hangars to meet fellow members of the design
team. Straplene Corrity had trotted up briskly to welcome him, followed
by Rangent Hobharp, solidly muscular and grinning broadly, and lanky
Spacker Crobes. Soon they had gathered into an enthusiastic huddle to
decide which of their current projects would most suit Mosper&#146;s level of
training. An unshaven middle-aged man who had been standing nearby
frowning at the ceiling wandered over, made as if to shake his hand, but
instead clapped him on the shoulder and nodded without speaking, before
heading out again. Mosper remembered thinking that the man&#146;s clothes
looked as if they had been slept in. Spacker offhandedly informed him
that he had just met the Director himself, Cravian Drowl.  <P>Cravian Drowl: a man with an enviable reputation as a paragon of
probity, a level-headed problem-solver, a moderator of disputes, whose
competence was beyond question. He had worked hard over the years to
perfect this image. An only child of parents who lived in a state of
uneasy truce, his retentive memory and observational skills equipped him
with a sometimes startling ability to assess others&#146; states of mind
before anything had been communicated verbally.  <P>With a penchant
for figures, but as yet with no specific career in mind, Drowl had opted
to qualify in accountancy, while conscientiously cultivating the
techniques necessary to put people at their ease. This seemingly
effortless knack of inspiring trust allowed him in due course to advance
to positions in senior management. People of both sexes found they had
no reservations about confiding in him, although Drowl was vaguely
disappointed that none of these encounters was the prelude to the kind
of intimate relationship he had imagined. He chose not to dwell on those
brief fumblings with Witany Yargle which had left them both hot and
humiliated, and resolved to concentrate on work. At Snoak&#146;s water
purification plant, in the absence of any opposition, he rose steadily
to become Operations Manager, a post he held for almost ten years before
beginning to feel a vague restlessness. Looking beyond his familiar
comfort zone, he happened to notice that there was a vacancy for the
Directorship of Meheric&#146;s Aeronautic Institute, a position which came
with the additional benefit of self-contained furnished accommodation.
He suspected he did not have the full range of skills for the job, but
his interest was piqued.  <P>Of the four other candidates, all had
far higher levels of technical expertise than Cravian Drowl. Two had
worked on commercial pods, Den Flepter as flight engineer, Zoel Torison
as pilot. A third, Veiv Maufrig, had worked for many years abroad,
progressing from cargo-handler to Podport Chief of Security. The fourth
was Ko Prodovel, a specialist in micro-engineering. Her public profile
was of a well-groomed ambitious woman of formidable talents and
conspicuously expensive tastes. She was reputed to have been the brains
behind the success of the ParaPet organization, earning her (when safely
out of earshot) the dubiously respectful nickname of &#147;Pokehead&#148;.  <P>
An unhappy series of events led to a shortening of the odds in
Drowl&#146;s favour. In the week following the formal interviews Flepter had
been seriously injured in a snow-float accident on Mount Kyren. During a
routine dental appointment Torison was regrettably diagnosed as
suffering from the onset of Hiriffer&#146;s Syndrome, a neuromuscular
affliction which gradually inhibits speech until the victim can utter
only fricatives. Then there was the report in the Quanderpyre Press,
&#147;SNAFFLED BAGGAGE FUNDED PODPORT PERKS &#150; SAYS EX-HEAD OF SEC&#146;S SEXY EX&#148;
in which one of Maufrig&#146;s resentful former wives revealed that her
former husband had for years secretly conducted a lucrative sideline
selling confiscated goods. After questioning, Maufrig had been taken
into custody, pending further investigation.  <P>The Institute was
dependent on State funding, and its limited annual budget was allocated
at the Director&#146;s discretion. It was partly his reputation for safe
economic management that tipped the balance towards Cravian Drowl over
the other remaining candidate, the more technically experienced if
allegedly extravagant &#147;Pokehead&#148; Prodovel. When interviewed, &#147;Pokehead&#148;
had been eager to explain how her expertise might be applied to aspects
of pod technology. She filled in the odd awkward silences with sharp
remarks about the cost of progress and the difficulties of private
enterprise, and made it clear that she knew how to knock a team into
shape.  <P>She was obviously fiercely energetic, highly capable and
somewhat intimidating.  <P>What sealed the decision was the
interviewers&#146; unanimous agreement that Drowl, despite being new to
aeronautics, was confident and motivated, and had the kind of reassuring
presence which boded well for the future smooth running of the
Institute. Each of them had felt that he had answered their questions
with a disarmingly honesty, and had no doubt that Drowl had the makings
of an excellent Director. Sadly, they were to be proved wrong.  <P>He moved from his north Snoak apartment with its view of the
deeply-shadowed shelving of the sandstone quarry into the comparative
luxury of a suite of furnished rooms in Meheric&#146;s Institute. For the
first few years everything went reasonably well. His work at the water
purifying plant had accustomed Drowl to the basic principles of
engineering, and although he was not expected to equip himself with an
oily rag, a pair of calipers or a wrench, he soon familiarized himself
with the terminology of pod mechanics. He made a point of meeting and
chatting to the designers, assistant airtechs and ancillary staff,
acquainting himself with their functions and degrees of responsibility.
He assured them he was always open to new ideas, and that any concerns
or grievances would be treated sympathetically and in confidence. Those
he spoke to were left with the pleasurable feeling that their new
Director was someone with their best interests at heart. In Research and
Development, the creative hub where sustained funding was so crucial,
the mood among the airtech designers was almost celebratory.  <P>While Drowl was not averse to seeking informed advice, he positively
avoided having to delegate decision-making. He felt that letting others
operate on his behalf would somehow degrade the responsibilities of his
position. Consequently, every choice he made, whether relating to
finance, management or maintenance carried its niggling burden of
anxiety, which he strove to suppress.  <P>His secretary, a local
girl, seemed to be adept at prioritizing matters that required his
attention, and ensured that any documentation, once dealt with, was
appropriately filed away.  <P>As might be expected, the principal
conflict lay in staying within budget while keeping all departments of
the Institute functioning efficiently. From past records he could see
that R &amp; D was the potentially profitable area, but also the most
expensive to keep supplied with necessary hardware. Any restriction was
bound to affect the morale of its highly specialized team. He knew that
over time he would have to make economies, but they must be unobtrusive.
It was a difficult balance, but as Director, it was under his control.
He couldn&#146;t afford to be seen to make mistakes. He dismissed the nagging
thought that he might be out of his depth. Insidiously, like a virulent
infection, the anxieties multiplied.  <P>Eventually even the most
commonplace problem began to bristle with unresolvable contingencies. In
his pursuit of economy he gradually cut back on renovation, postponed
repairs, finally dispensed with secretarial help. He cancelled meetings,
sat for hours in his office, checking and re-checking figures, doubting
the logic of his own reasoning, puzzling over investigative safety
reports or proposals for technical improvements as if they had been
written in a totally unfamiliar language. As time passed Drowl grew
steadily more withdrawn. Sometimes he neglected to eat, and his evident
lack of sleep caused him to look increasingly haggard. He would wander
absentmindedly into hangars and workshops, avoiding confrontation,
rarely mumbling more than a few words to anyone. The Institute continued
to function, driven by the established momentum of multiple
interdependent daily tasks, but the seeds of chaos had been sown.  <P>
<p class=drop>&#147;And so, Scrupulator Atacrast,&#148; said Mosper Belk, &#147;you
must
understand that we airtechs hardly ever saw Director Drowl, and for many
months had no idea that anything was amiss. We were skilled at
improvising when requisitioned items were temporarily unavailable, and
we had facilities for manufacturing our own precision tools, so work on
ongoing projects was scarcely affected. But we all assumed that our
research papers had been sent on, as was customary, to the State
Scrutinizing Committee, and copies duly stored in the Institute&#146;s
files.&#148;  <P>&#147;Committee with response of elongated silence&#133;&#148;,
Atacrast suggested.  <P>Mosper smiled, a little ruefully. &#147;Indeed,
a silence of such length that we made attempts to seek an explanation.
My colleagues and I went to see the Director. We had not known that by
then he no longer had a secretary, and were disconcerted to see the
disorganized state of his office. Boxes of documents were stacked on the
floor around his desk, and the surface of the desk itself was littered
with sheets of hand-written calculations amid the detritus of what
looked like abandoned meals. Drowl apologized for the mess, explained
that his secretary had left (he did not say why), and assured us that
there was no cause for alarm, matters were in hand, he would personally
see to it that the Committee would be made aware of our concerns.
Corrity and I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt, although
Hobharp and Crobes suspected that for some unknown reason we were being
fobbed off.&#148;  <P>Atacrast asked if he might have a glass of water,
but was readily persuaded by his host&#146;s counter-offer of emberskelven,
the reddish-gold brew which was one of Snoak&#146;s local attractions.  <P>&#147;A week or so later,&#148; Mosper resumed, &#147;we went once again to Drowl&#146;s
office, determined to extract satisfactory answers from the Director. He
was standing by the window, wearing his outdoor coat, staring out at the
rain. His face looked strained, with dark pouches under his eyes, and he
seemed to have some difficulty recognizing us. In contrast to our
previous visit the office was practically bare; the boxes had been
cleared away, and only a small pile of papers remained on the desk,
neatly trapped under a green onyx paperweight in the shape of a sleeping
dog. When we asked him about the lack of response to our research
papers, Drowl launched into a barely coherent explanation involving
budgetary requirements, regulatory constraints, regrettable economic
necessities, bureaucratic procedures and other such waffle. Then, with
an abrupt change of mood he evicted us from his office, muttering that
he needed to attend to an urgent personal matter. There was something so
dourly implacable about his attitude, the look in his eyes so desperate,
we were frankly too taken aback to raise a sensible objection. After
that it was too late.&#148;  <P>&#147;Too late?&#148; prompted the Scrupulator. <P>
&#147;That was the last time anyone at the Institute ever saw or
heard from Cravian Drowl.&#148;  <P>There was nothing of obvious
significance left in the Director&#146;s office other than an ashy heap of
burned paper in the ceramic incinerazer. It was assumed that Drowl had
taken his paperweight with him. It was not found in his private rooms,
whose abandoned contents apparently offered no clue as to his possible
whereabouts. This posed a quandary for the investigative team, a trio of
burly detechs and a forensic specialist from Snoak Central, who had been
called in when the Director failed to return.  <P>The entire
workforce was questioned with discreet efficiency. The lately dismissed
secretary, the quietly dependable Seepy Trasset, had been duly traced to
her shared apartment above a bakery in Lower Meheric. She was persuaded
to overcome residual feelings of loyalty, and asked to describe anything
unusual about the Director&#146;s behaviour in the weeks preceding her
dismissal. Seepy told how he had become strangely secretive about the
filing of paperwork, and prevented her accessing even material she had
previously handled. She confirmed that he had grown increasingly remote
and uncommunicative, and that while genuinely concerned about his health
she was actually more relieved than disappointed when he told her she
was no longer required.  <P>Mosper and his three colleagues had
been closely questioned, as Drowl&#146;s last contacts in the Institute.
Further investigation revealed that the State Scrutinizing Committee had
received no research papers from the Institute for almost a year, and no
such documents were to be found either among the remaining
office files or in the Director&#146;s apartment.  <P>It soon became
clear to the investigators that the missing man had almost certainly
been suffering from severe work-related stress. The Institute&#146;s finances
were stretched to their limit. It was concluded that an obsessive fear
of overspending had led him to the irrational decision to ignore or
actively hold back any proposals that might entail further costs. In
Drowl&#146;s mind the prospect of allowing the Scrutinizing Committee to
approve research papers, irrespective of any long-term benefits, would
have been fraught with disaster. It was therefore believed that the
papers, together with any filed copies had been destroyed, and that the
wretched Drowl, unable to face the consequences of his mismanagement,
had fled in a state of guilt and confusion.  <P>Mosper Belk blinked
away the unbidden moisture in his eyes as he gingerly examined the
papers that Hulf Atacrast had removed from his document case. They were
indeed the originals, complete with marginal notes in a neat hand he
knew to be his own. The individual pages had been carefully uncreased
and sheathed in transparent sleeves. The paper itself was slightly
yellowed and brittle, some corners and edges showing evidence of
desultory nibbling. The ink was still legible, but patchily faded and
stained. He had never expected to see again these distillations of so
many hours of focused thought and excited discussion with his fellow
airtechs; the long-lost repository of their combined inventiveness.  <P>
&#147;Meheric Faculty Propulsion now much changed, respected Belk. New
buildings, new people, some new ideas. Paper is dead, extinguished, like
the doodle. Now, all e-screens, haptic panels, telefacture,
self-correcting praxins, all manner advances since time of Drowl and his
sad misguidance.&#148;  <P>&#147;Drowl, who was never actually found,&#148;
murmured Mosper, &#147;despite supposed sightings in a dozen far-flung places
over the following years. We often wondered, with a mixture of
bitterness and well&#133; pity, what really became of him.&#148;  <P>Atacrast
shrugged and raised his hands, as if fending off an enormous balloon.
&#147;Defaced utterly from Meheric Archive, perhaps for better. And now after
years you hold again valuable research deserving of proper credit, which
as Scrupulator I would be honoured to make possible.&#148; <P>They sat
for a while in reflective silence, sipping at their emberskelven,
savouring its tang and listening to the faint hiss of crepitation.
Later, Hulf Atacrast insisted on marking the occasion with a meal at The
Cylinder in Gropp&#146;s Market, prepared under the supervision of Tedor
Safra himself. Mosper Belk began to protest at this suggestion, but
Atacrast assured him that he had made an open reservation well in
advance, being both a gourmet and an optimist. Belk&#146;s home in Prossing
Street was only a short walking distance from the restaurant, which he
had passed many times without really noticing the expensive delights
being consumed within.  <P>After the meal, the Scrupulator left to
catch the night-pod back to Meheric, while Mosper strolled back to his
house, glancing up from time to time at the swiftly winking beads of
micropods as they threaded the sky carrying their vital commerce. He had
heard them called &#147;Pokehead Pods&#148;, but had no idea why. He must remember
to ask one of his young friends at work. Sometimes he felt that the new
technology was leaving him behind.  <P><small>&copy; L. J. Sklaroff 2016 All Rights Reserved </small>
