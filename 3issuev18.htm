<div><i>Oh, wherefore art thou, Damocles?</i>
<p class="drop">"How is she? Any change?" Pygar walked
across the bedchamber to stand by my shoulder. He sounded genuinely
concerned for the young woman lying fully-clothed on the divan before
us, as if our overall situation meant nothing. <P>However, I managed to produce my usual sardonic grin. "Well, if she dies
I'm sure we'll be the first to know." <P>He glared at me. "Must you always be so flippant?" <P>I shrugged. "It's just the way I'm made. Incidentally, Library has
reported a new access event. The information obtained is in the special
annex, if you ever bothered to look." <P>"And does it impact directly upon our plight?" <P>"No, not exactly." <P>"Then why bother to mention it?" <P>"Well, apparently I'm based on an actor called Clark Gable." <P>Pygar frowned. "An actor? Some music-hall swell?" <P>"Close enough. Whereas <i>you</i>, my fine semi-feathered friend&#133;" I
slapped his muscular shoulder,"&#133;are from a tale entitled 'Barbarella'." <P>His wings quivered in obvious irritation. "A story-book character? What
nonsense - angels <i>exist</i>, of that I am certain." <P>I gestured to my horns. "And what of devils?" <P>Before he could reply a Servitor entered the bedroom; an androgynous
young woman clad in the simple grey dress of her calling. She approached
us and dropped to one knee, head bowed. "My Lords Arbiter,  Constable
Fain requests your presence to rule in a dispute." <P>Day-to-day civic strife held no appeal for me. "You attend, Pygar. You
always see the best in people." <P>He smiled, somewhat ruefully. "And yet I fear it is you who truly
appreciates the human condition. What was it you said last week - 'a
plague on both your houses'? Most apt, as it transpired." <P>"Still, walk amongst the populace, they find your presence
heart-warming.
Me they merely fear." <P>The angel inclined his head by way of acknowledgement. He left with the
Servitor following a deferential three paces behind. <P>I made a mental note to watch my turn of phrase, but this new
'Shakespeare' I'd been reading seemed to worm his way into one's very
substance. Library could not regulate the information acquired during
these ever more frequent contacts with an entire <i>universe</i> somehow
separated from our own - and the more I learned the less certain I
became of our world and my place in it. <P>Alone, I turned to glare at the sleeping form of Aurelia Havisham.
Although resting for a few days at a time was commonplace it was now
five weeks since last she stirred. Aurelia was the axis around which the
great city-state of Haven revolved; a benevolent mistress, immortal and
ageless. Pygar and I were her stewards, her conscience, her dispensers
of justice. The world may change but we did not. <P>And it was all a fraud.  <P>"Library!" <P><i>Yes, Gable, I am here.</i> <P>"Have you been able to learn anything more concerning Aurelia? Anything
at all?" <P><i>Unfortunately nothing beyond the original reference to 'biomorphic
dissonance'. However I have determined that the technology of our world
is classified as 'late Victorian', and while the significance of that
epithet escapes me, in context I would seem to be an obvious
anachronism.</i> <P>I frowned. "Meaning?" <P><i>Meaning that, as we have come to suspect, this world and everything
in it is the product of an outside agency.</i> <P>My scalp crinkled with fear. "Are you saying Miss Havisham is, is
<i>God</i>?" <P><i>Everything is relative, Gable, but I fear she may be the keystone in
our	particular vault of heaven</i>. <P>Inarticulate rage made me snarl and clench my fists.  <P>"Should I be worried?" <P>A voice from behind made me start. I required a moment's composure; time
to force a smile into my voice. "It's nothing that I can't handle,
Stephanie." <P>Stephanie Collins was my current paramour;
over the years I'd watched her
grow from gangly child into voluptuous womanhood. She was possessed of a
keen wit and an intelligence to rival my own, choosing the role of
Infernal consort over that of social matriarch. I almost felt flattered,
but our liaison was obviously the product of enlightened self-interest,
nothing more. <P>She swept forward in a rustle of skirts to stand by my side; one hand on
hip, the other resting on my shoulder. "No change in our sleeping
beauty, I see?" <P>"None, but I'm sure she'd be touched by your concern." <P>"Pah! I'm well aware of the <i>intimacy</i> the three of you share when
she's awake, so you'll forgive me for enjoying her continued absence.
I'd just as soon see an end to her." <P>"We're in danger. All of us. Everything." As soon as the words escaped
my lips I regretted  uttering them, but nothing is as corrosive as
knowledge you cannot share. And if anyone could appreciate how
precarious our situation had become it was Stephanie - for Pygar seemed
possessed of a wilfully anti-intellectual bent that drove me to
distraction. <P>I felt Stephanie stiffen. "I did not think her prone to jealousy." <P>Her self-centred concern made me laugh, despite everything. "Aurelia
turns to Pygar for tenderness, myself for debauchery, and others for
general lassitude. I very much doubt she harbours any resentment at our
dalliance during those times she absents herself." <P>Stephanie pursed her lips. "Dalliance? Is that all I am to you?" <P>I squeezed her heavy rear. "A rose by any other name would smell as
sweet." <P>She frowned. "Meaning?" <P>"Meaning that regardless of how I refer to you, you will always be as
dear to me as you are now." <P>She snorted in a most unladylike way, but a slight smile played on her
lips. "Always one with the silken tongue, Gable. But if not jealousy,
what threatens us?" <P>So much for deflecting the impact of my ill-judged outburst. I took a
deep breath. "Have you never questioned why Haven is the only remaining
city on Earth?" <P>Stephanie looked at me askance. "Everything beyond the Ring Mountains is
gone. But you ask me of history? You who lived through it?" <P>"I'm merely immortal, not infallible. I forget names if not faces, dates
if not experiences. Yet when I think back to the Fall, the foundation of
Haven, my memories are always the same. Incomplete but unchanging, like
a stage play repeated again and again, always following the same
script." <P>"And this troubles you?" <P>"I believe&#133;" I stroked my thin moustache, "&#133;I <i>fear</i> that this
world of ours was created little more than four decades ago." <P>My paramour stepped back. "My parents were no mere figment of my
imagination, I assure you." <P>"No, no, they were real enough, but their memories, everything they knew
to be true, that is another matter." <P>"What arrant nonsense, Gable, have you lost your mind? Or do you believe
that God intervened to preserve us within this mountainous ark?" <P>"No, not God." I gestured towards the sleeping form of Aurelia Havisham.
"Her." <P>Stephanie stood with hands on hips, chin tilted in defiance. "Her? The
Lady
Eternal is no deity. She does not command the birds to sing or the rain
to fall from the sky. The way she takes her <i>earthly</i> pleasures is
not the	stuff of worship, even amongst those young men she favours." <P>"No deity? Certainly, but still I believe all <i>this</i> was fashioned
to a
design of her choosing." <P>Anger darkened her face. "A sham? Worlds within worlds? And what then
are we save actors on a stage of dreams? No, Gable, no - I'll not be
gulled by anyone, not even our Lady." Stephanie drew a slim blade
through a
slit in her overskirt and raised it above her head. <P>I seized her wrist as she advanced towards the bed, pulling her close so
that our lips almost touched. "Be not so hasty, my love. We may all wait
upon sweet Aurelia's pleasure in one way or another, but she's no tyrant
to be cast down by a petticoat assassin. Not even one as beautiful as
you." We kissed, even as I squeezed her wrist until the stiletto dropped
to the floor. <P>Stephanie glared at me with eyes of wet stone. "What then are
<i>you</i>,
Gable? A body-slave sworn to protect her? Do we live or die at her
whim?" <P><i>Gable</i>. <P>I seized her roughly by the upper arms. "Think on it, damn you. Without
<i>her</i> what use does the universe have for <i>us</i>?" <P><i>Gable, this is important</i>. <P>"Please forgive me for interrupting this lover's tiff, but perhaps
somewhere less public would be more appropriate?" It was the voice of
Aurelia Havisham. <P>Stephanie twisted free from my grasp and curtsied. "My Lady. We meant no
disrespect." <P>I took a moment to compose myself then turned, smiling. "My Lady." <P>Aurelia was sitting up in bed, clearly amused by our little tableau.
"Kindly leave us, Mistress Collins. Gable will be along presently to
smooth things over, whatever the cause of your, ah, disagreement." <P>Stephanie curtsied again and withdrew, giving me a baleful glare as she
passed. I responded with an exaggerated bow that provoked a defiant toss
of her head. <P>Despite having laid undisturbed for so long there was no sign of atrophy
as Aurelia rose from the bed. "In many ways she's the ideal match for
you, Gable. You should not antagonise her so wantonly." <P>I toyed with my moustache. "And yet, my dear, you remain the mistress of
my heart." <P>"You're a rogue and charlatan, Gable. Which is why you'll be forever at
my side." Aurelia walked over and opened the doors to her Juliet
balcony.
It was late May and scent from the rose garden filled the room. She
breathed deeply and smiled. "Oh, how I've missed <i>this</i>." <P>I stood close behind, fingertips resting on her shoulders, and kissed
the nape of her neck, her shoulder, the lobe of her ear. My voice was a
low growl. "Oh, how I've missed this." <P>In response she turned to face me, but placed a diminutive hand on my
chest and 'pushed' me away. "Was there something you wanted to ask me?"
Her face was bland, seemingly devoid of guile. <P>Ignorance may not have been bliss but it had its appeal. However I knew
this uncertainty would fester within me. I cleared my throat. "Is this
world a lie?" <P>Aurelia arched an eyebrow. "A lie? It's no mass illusion for your
benefit, if that's what you mean." <P>"You overheard us, you know damn well what I mean." <P>She sighed. "You no longer believe that Haven is a refuge designed to
survive the fall of a once-great civilization? You no longer believe
that we-three are its guardians?" <P>"I think it artifice, a folly, if one constructed on a gargantuan
scale." <P>"What first raised your suspicions? For forty years you've accepted this
version of events. What changed?" <P>"Library." <P>"Ah, yes, Library. He was always going to be a necessary evil. The
serpent in my Eden, if you will. What happened?" <P>"New information, impossible information, which I now see has somehow
leaked in from the real world." <P>"Haven has endured far longer than anyone thought possible, but nothing
lasts forever." <P>I drew myself up. "Is that why you returned, for a final visit? You
wished to deliver our death sentence in person?" <P>"If it were the end of the world, and nothing could be done to avert it,
would you <i>really</i> want to know?" <P>"The true test of a man is how he faces the inevitable." <P>Aurelia prodded me in the chest. "But <i>you</i> are no mere man, Gable,
<i>you</i> are the Devil incarnate. The embodiment of mankind's venal
pursuits, just as Pygar
represents his spiritual side." <P>"Words, words, but I hear no salvation in them. May the condemned man at
least know the capital crime of which he is guilty?" <P>She did not answer directly but turned away to stand at the balcony,
leaning on the wrought-iron railing. "Do you know why I chose the name
Aurelia Havisham?" <P>"So your identity is another falsehood? I suppose it hardly matters
now." <P>"Oh, the 'Aurelia' is true enough but 'Miss Havisham' is a literary
character, a young woman who becomes a recluse after being jilted at the
altar." <P>I heard the catch in her voice and said nothing. <P>"In my world, in the <i>real</i> world, I was an heiress. The beauty
barbers did what they could but I knew it was my wealth that lent me
allure. I could have accepted that, enjoyed the company of young men,
then younger men, but ultimately I'd become a figure of ridicule. Some
double-standards never die, apparently." <P>"Apparently." <P>"But then I met Simon. He was young, ambitious&#133;" She glanced over her
shoulder, "&#133;<i>vigorous</i>, and made no secret of wanting my fortune to
further his grandiose designs. And still I loved him. Our wedding was a
lavish affair, even by the standards of the day, and the Patriarch
himself agreed to officiate." <P>"You do not have to continue, Aurelia, I believe the outcome is clear." <P>"I reached the cathedral to find only the groomsman waiting. He handed
me a letter from Simon, hand-written at least. I have it still,
unopened." <P>"Aurelia-" <P>"I could not face the congregation, I could not face society. Like Miss
Havisham I retreated to my country estate but even that was not enough.
I needed to escape my world and everything, everyone, in it." <P>"And so you created Haven, by means I cannot begin to understand." <P>She laughed, although it was bitter-sweet at best. "This is the mote in
God's eye. A fraction of the universe folded in upon itself, hidden even
from divine scrutiny." <P>"Your world seems one of many wonders." <P>"My world? My world is ailing, Gable. It is exhausted, overcrowded,
devoid of hope. It is run by desperate men contemplating desperate
measures." <P>My mouth moved soundlessly for a few moments while my mind floundered
for a reply. "They, they would come <i>here</i>? Occupy our land,
enslave us?" <P>"Heavens, no!" Aurelia sounded genuinely amused at my naivety and I felt
my face burn with embarrassment. "Haven only exists as a reality-bubble
within the event horizon of an artificial singularity." <P>"I do not understand what that means, but I know that bubbles always
burst." <P>"Yes, bubbles always burst, but the pioneering technology I funded, the
way in which Haven was created, bought me a place at the top table, so
to speak. That same methodology will now be used on a vastly greater
scale to transmute all <i>this</i>&#133;" She spread her arms as if to
encompass the world outside the window,"&#133;into a second Earth, a virgin
canvas." <P>"Man would now rival God in his creation?" <P>I could hear the frown in her voice. "It's based on 'dark matter
manipulation', but do not ask me what that means." She hesitated for a
moment, "I understand that the process is not without risk." <P>Ah, so there it was. The open cell door that leads only to the scaffold.
Only with great effort did I keep the anger from my voice. "I did not
think you this cruel, my sweet. You could have watched from afar and
only explained matters after our miraculous transformation. Or mourned
our passing." <P>Aurelia sighed, "I am old, Gable, old beyond my time. This body,
<i>this</i> Aurelia, offers an escape from my decrepit carcass back in
the real world. In any event our fates are intertwined. Haven sprang
from my imagination and now it is I and I alone who must imprint that
vision onto the raw chaos of creation." She turned to face me, "Imagine,
I am to be the architect of a new world. My sisters in the Eastern Star
will venerate my name in ages to come." <P>I seized her, took her in my arms. "How long do we have? Is there yet
time enough for love?" <P>"The process is imminent, but you were always opportunistic." <P>I caressed her cheek. "And should this grand enterprise of yours come to
nought, what then?" <P>"Then God blinks&#133;and nothing." <P>I laughed. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more." <P>She stared at me in obvious surprise. "Macbeth? Shakespeare at his most
pessimistic. However I would say The Tempest is more apt, given our
circumstances." <P>"The Tempest? Enlighten me." <P>Now it was Aurelia's turn to laugh. "O brave new world, that has such
people in it!" <P>"And shall there be room for all, on these virgin shores?" <P>"Well, I'm unsure what humanity in general will make of Pygar, but it
<i>certainly</i> isn't ready for the Devil himself." <P>I grinned, leaning in to kiss her. "Frankly, my dear, I don't
<i>give</i> a damn." <P><small>&copy; Martin M. Clark 2016 All Rights Reserved </small>
