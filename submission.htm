                        <h2>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h2>
                        <p><strong>Mythaxis is currently open for submissions.</strong> We seek and offer the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Length</strong>: 1,000-7,500 words. This is a firm limit. Generally speaking, the further a story goes beyond 5,000 words the more it will need to impress, but the door is not shut in advance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $20 on acceptance and return of contract. Payment via PayPal.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We aim to acknowledge submissions the same day they are received. I<strong>f you do not receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours of submission, please get in touch</strong>.</p>
                        <p>We aim to accept or reject within 14 days of that acknowledgment, but rl (real life) and rl (reading load) can get in the way. <strong>If you do not hear from us after 30 days, feel free to query</strong>.</p>
                        <p>We require <strong>First Print and Digital rights with a six month period of exclusivity</strong> from the date of publication. We also ask permission to potentially include accepted pieces in future anthologies, in event of which
                            an additional full payment and digital copy will be offered in compensation. All other rights remain entirely with the author.</p>
                        <p><strong>Simultaneous submissions are not only accepted, they are encouraged</strong>. Put your work out there, as many places as you can! We merely ask that you notify us of acceptance at another market as soon as possible. <strong>We do not currently invite reprint submissions</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Submissions should be anonymous</strong>, and do not require a cover page. Only include the story title, the approximate word count, and the story text. Do not include the author’s name in or on the file.</p>
                        <p><strong>All submissions must be the original work of the author</strong>. We anticipate an adult readership in the sense of maturity, but this is not a market for pornographic or offensively extreme content.</p>
                        <p><strong>We welcome writers of any and all backgrounds</strong>, be they cultural or personal, and submissions exploring diverse perspectives and experiences, provided they do not seek to attack or demean those of others.</p>
                        <p>We look forward to reading your work... but first:</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>A friendly word of advice</h3>
                        <p>It's important for authors to understand what they are giving up when they assign "first" publishing rights to a magazine. After we publish your story, you will only be able to offer it elsewhere as a <strong>reprint</strong>, which may mean you can only sell it for
                        less money, or for free - and some markets don't accept reprints at all.</p>
                        <p>We want to publish great writing but our budget is modest, there are certainly better-paying markets out there. So why not try to land your masterpiece at the big markets first? Nothing ventured, nothing gained, after all - 
                        and when they prove themselves blind to your glory, we'll still be here to help you prove them wrong!</p>
                        <p>Okay, we've said our piece. If you're still keen to roll the dice...</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>HOW TO SUBMIT</h3>
                        <p class="middle"><strong>MYTHAXIS IS CURRENTLY CLOSED TO SUBMISSIONS</strong></p>
                        <p>We will repoen our subs window following the release of our next issue. Check back then!</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3>FORMATTING GUIDELINES</h3>
                        <p>Acceptable document types are RTF, DOC, or DOCX.</p>
                        <p>Straightforward manuscript formatting is preferred for editorial convenience:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Please use an easy-reading font (Times New Roman 12pt, etc.).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Do not manually insert empty lines between paragraphs, or use tabs for first-line indents. <strong>Use paragraph formatting</strong> to set automatic indents or paragraph breaks.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Use a single centred # to represent essential section breaks.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Use <em>italics</em> for italics, <span class="underline">don’t underline</span> instead. Smart (“curly”) punctuation is fine.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If your manuscript includes any unusual formatting, please alert the editors when submitting and have a really good, story-related reason.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>When submitting, mentioning the fact that <strong>"cheese tastes pink"</strong> will let us know that you have read these guidelines right to the end... and if you would like to receive feedback on your story when we respond, please say so and we shall.</p>
                        <p>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the editor at the above address. We look forward to reading your work!</p>
