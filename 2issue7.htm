<div><i>A Tale of Eastern Promise.</i>
<p class=drop>Jez couldn't get his head around it. We
were lingering over a couple of pints of some yuppy ale or other in The 
Peasant's Revolt (apostrophe in the wrong place on
the new inn sign), a pub in a warren of London streets, and
he said to me: "Can't get me 'ead around it, mate." <P>"Around what, Jeremy?" <P>"All that stuff wot's 'appening these days. Them djinns, like. An' them
magicians and that flyin' carpet caper. Why don' they use a 'elicopter
like anyone else, eh?" <P>"You yourself don't use a helicopter a great deal, though, Jez, do you?" <P> 
<div class=tinyquote>There was the Door to which I found no Key;<hr>
There was the Veil through which I might not see:<hr>
Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee<hr>
There was--and then no more of Thee and Me.</div>
"Not as such, mate. Not as such. Point taken. But I ain't flittin' about
over folks' 'eads on a ruddy doormat, either. It's takin' the bread out
of the mouths of taxi drivers, innit? Not that I 'ave a lotta time for
them robbin' bastids, either. Can't get in an' out of a cab these days
for less'n a tenner, even if it don't move more'n a 'undred yards. Come
to think of it, I wouldn't mind one of them flyin' rugs, matter of fact.
Not that you could get more'n one passenger on most of 'em, an' they're
'opeless for any sorta luggage, really, ain't they?. They're not really
load-bearin', kind of thing. You wouldn't want to try shiftin', like, a
washin' machine on one, would ya? But I'd think they'd be attractive to
wimmin, though, eh? Comfy, too." <P>Jez could go in this fashion for hours, so I said: "What's your point,
Jeremy?" <P>"My point is, ya see, my point is.... I dunno whether t'ask for one." <P>"Ask who?" <P>"The genie, o'course, mate. If I should 'appen to do, like, a favour to
one a them genies or djinns or wottever they're called, an' 'e should
give me, you know, three wishes, as they do..." <P>"As they allegedly do, yes..." <P>"Whether, in that case, I oughta ask for one o' them magic carpets as
well as, o'course, fantastic riches an' eternal life, an' that. It's
like winnin' the lottery wivout 'avin' to go down Tesco's and buy a
ruddy ticket." <P>"It's not at all like winning the lottery, Jez. These genies are tricky,
you know. You could find yourself spending your eternal life inside a
huge gold ingot like that poor bugger in Eastbourne." <P>"Ah, well, ya see. That's where I got ya, like. See the old Shoreditch
telephone exchange, right?" <P>"No." <P>"Big ruddy building up Shoreditch?" <P>"Still no." <P>"Doesn' matter, mate. 'Uge massive ruddy buildin' they closed down when
they found out the place was totally empty. Arfur says..." <P>"Arthur?" <P>"Yeah, Arfur, the wife's  bruvver-in-lawr, right? Well, 'e says British 
Telecom
moved the 'ole phone exchange into a computer the size of a biscuit box down
Leaden'all in 1981. Arfur lost 'is night watchman job when they shut the
doors last Easter. Only they've broke it up into like offices now an' 'e's got 'is job
back." <P>"Where is this going, Jeremy?" <P>"I'm tellin' ya, ain't I? There's this Ay-rab lawyer got a office in
there now what'll write you up a forum of words..." <P>"Form of words?" <P>"That's wot I said, innit? A forum of words wiv all the right stuff in
it, namin' Allah an' the prophets an' powers that be an' everyfink.
Completely bullet-proof, mate, only it's, like, customized to wottever
ya want, so the djinns can't take you for a ride." <P>"And this 'Ay-rab lawyer' charges how much?" <P>"'Undred quid. Flat rate for three wishes." <P>"So <i>he</i> takes you for a ride, instead of the djinn. Why don't you
offer this lawyer a cut of the enormous riches when you get them,
instead of paying  the flat rate now?" <P>"Are you nuts? That could get seriously expensive, mate. No, I'll take
the flat rate now. But I gotta decide wot I want, see." <P>"Hmm... How about the eternally balanced bank account?" <P>"Wot's that?" <P>"Well, you ask for a Swiss bank account that stays balanced at, say, a
million pounds, no matter how much you spend. It works well for tax,
too. It's not as noticeable as all that gold and jewels and stuff that
these djinns usually hand out, and you don't have to worry about burglars
like you would with a cellar full of bling." <P>"Cool." <P>"And then you've got to be clear that your eternal life takes place in
good health, you don't age too much, and there's a termination clause in
case, after a few hundred years, you get tired of life." <P>"Never thoughta that. Cool, yeah." <P>I drained my pint and stood up. "Anyway, Jez, I've got to get back to
work. Let me know how you make out, and remember me when you're stinking
rich." <P>"Yeah, sure, mate. Course I will." <P>I knew Jeremy was seriously deluded in hoping to find a supernatural
benefactor, but he was right that it was difficult to keep track of all
the new developments, as the world of the Arabian Nights began to invade
normal life. London appeared to be the epicentre of the most vigorous
activity. The flying carpets problem was the very least of it, with the
government trying to levy a tax on them, and the Civil Aviation
Authority and Air Traffic Control trying to make sure they didn't pose a
hazard to aircraft. <P><div class=tinyquote>When You and I behind the Veil are past,<hr>
Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last,<hr>
Which of our Coming and Departure heeds<hr>
As the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast.</div>
Then there was the Magnetic Mountain that had appeared in the Thames
Estuary. Anything iron that went closer than half a mile to the huge
black rock was drawn in and stuck to it. No amount of tugging would pull
a stricken ship away. Even wooden boats tend to have metal nails holding
them together, and most boats of any kind have an engine. A few
adventurers succeeded in rowing ashore in rubber dinghies, but one man
was fastened to a rock by his wrist watch until his companions managed
to extract him. And another, who had a cardiac pacemaker, died in a
distressingly gory fashion reminiscent of the movie Alien when his
pacemaker decided to attach itself to the rock. Ensuring that every
vessel gave the Magnetic Mountain a good mile of clearance had become a
difficult task for Trinity House, especially since it had proved 
impractical to mount a lighthouse on the rock. <P>But there were novelties to enjoy. In my work at the British Museum, we
had already had the opportunity to analyse a number of simple but
interesting "Arabian Nights" artifacts, including a jewelled dagger so
apparently old that carbon dating of its wooden haft estimated its age
at eight thousand years, and what at first had appeared to be a doll of
solid gold, but was now suspected, due to the discovery of a structure
of fossilised bones and organs below the metal skin, to be a miniaturised
gold-plated person.  <P><p class=drop>As I returned from my rather extended lunch hour with Jez, Dr Halifax
was waiting for me with another treasure for our collection. Halifax was
temporarily in charge of the Middle Eastern section of the museum ever
since Professor Barnsley had recklessly fallen out with a magic carpet
salesman and been turned into an ape for one lunar month. Flying carpets
were expensive. The professor had wanted one for the museum's
collection, and he had attempted to get one on the cheap by theatening
the vendor with a Trading Standards investigation. He could still
communicate with his staff in writing - he had an elegant hand with a
fountain pen, even as a simian - but it was felt that his current image
lacked <I>gravitas</I>. <P>Halifax was good on his subject, but fussy and bossy in manner. However,
he had no direct authority over me. I was in Technical section, he was
in a sub-section of Exhibits, but he was plainly impatient for me to
look at this new trinket. It was a jewelled egg, apparently in ivory,
precious metals and gems, and rather reminiscent of the famous
Faberg&eacute; eggs. It was large - about the size of a rugby ball or
American football, but clearly egg-shaped, one end bulging more than the
other. <P>"Hmm... Where did this come from?" <P>"The RSPCA brought it in." <P>"Where did <I>they</I> get it?" <P>"Well, that was interesting." Halifax warmed to the subject. He plainly
had a tale to tell. "You remember that Googletube video everyone was
watching last week." <P>"Uuuh..." I hesitated. I hardly wanted to reveal that I'd been as amused
as everyone else at the disgraceful behaviour of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer with the thirteen houris, the swan and the donkey. <P>"You know... the roc!" <P>"Oh, yes. <I>That</I> video." A roc had taken up residence on the roof
of a block of council flats in Clapham. It more closely resembled a
pterodactyl than the huge eagle of legend. Its cries were like a
foghorn. In flight, it had about the same wingspan as a single-engined
Cessna aircraft, and it was wonderful to see. It seemed wary of humans,
but had no hesitation in preying on smaller animals and birds. No-one
walked their dog on Clapham Common any more, cats crept around, but only
after nightfall, and pigeons were a rare sight in the vicinity. <P>Two local youths had hatched a plan to become famous on Googletube. One
wrapped himself in his granny's fake fur coat and capered about on all
fours in view of the roc, while the other videoed the scene on his cell
phone. <P>The roc had, predictably, swooped on the dog impersonator, but, finding
him too heavy to lift, had gripped the screaming boy with its talons and
torn off the kid's left arm with its toothed "beak". The victim's
colleague had, in the tradition of wild life movie makers, continued to
film until the roc returned to its nest. The resulting shock video had
been a nine-day wonder. The injured boy's life was saved by paramedics,
but he was still in intensive care. <P>"Ah, yes. The roc. How did the RSPCA get hold of this?" I enquired. <P>"They were persuaded to try and capture the creature as if it was a
stray cat. They sent up a team, but the roc flew off, leaving this
behind in the nest." <P>"It can't be a roc's egg, surely. It's clearly manufactured." <P>"True," agreed Halifax, "But there's something inside, and we don't want
to break the egg to find out what." <P>"X-ray." <P>"Quite." <P>"OK. Let's go." I unlocked the lab and cleared some small articles from
the X-ray table. <P>We viewed the egg from all sides under X-rays. Whatever was inside the
egg was almost transparent to the beam. It was shapeless and hard to
see. What did show up, however, was an intricate mechanism below the
skin of the egg - interlocking cog wheels, screws, hinges, springs and
levers connected to the jewel settings and metal decorations on the
egg's surface. <P>"Yes," remarked Halifax, "We twiddled some of these jewels around, but
it didn't seem to do anything." <P>"It looks to me like an intricate puzzle," I said. "Just up my street.
Let me work on it for a while." <P>"Well..." Halifax was clearly reluctant to surrender his treasure. <P>"Come on. I'm your best hope. It won't leave the premises, I promise.
I'll call you when and if I get it open." <P>"You've got twenty-four hours, and do <i>not</i> break it." <P>"Oh, give me a break. This isn't some detective movie. It's Thursday
now. I'll get back to you by Monday. OK?" <P>"OK. But, after that, I'm taking it to St. Thomas's Hospital for an MRI
scan." <P>I suppressed a grin. With all that metal in the mechanism, an MRI scan
would be meaningless. But I'd tell him that on Monday. <P>As soon as Halifax had gone, I phoned Jeremy on his mobile. "Jeremy,
mate, have you got a phone number for that Arab lawyer?" <P><p class=drop>Khalid Emir was not at all what I expected. No robed oriental, he. From
his polished shoes to his polished hair, via his immaculate shiny suit
and gleaming white shirt, he looked more like a fangless Dracula than
the Sheikh of Araby. <P>He was exceptionally polite, meticulous in his questions, and produced
my Form of Words on a desktop computer. Inexhaustible Swiss Bank
Account, Eternal Youth With Termination Option, Enhanced Charisma. One
hundred pounds including VAT. American Express, apparently, was his
chosen payment method. <P>"Beware, sir," he added, "Not all demons are duly grateful for their
freedom. Nevertheless, a djinn may not act against you if you give him
no cause, so, above all, address him with courtesy and offer him no
violence, whatever threats he may utter, and utter them he will." <P>I thanked him, and he reminded me that we are all subject to the will of
Allah, and that our fates are written in advance.  <P>I did not tell him about the egg. <P><div class=tinyquote>The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord<hr>

It had been clear on the X-rays that the egg was a finely crafted box
with a combination lock. Arabian Nights lore strongly hinted at its true
purpose. I took precautions; I took more X-rays; I took my time.
Twenty-eight of the jewel settings were free to turn. Each jewel could
be turned to one of twenty-eight positions. To solve the combination by
trial and error would take much longer than the age of the planet. To
further complicate solution, part of the intricate mechanism was devoted
to making misleading random clicks and movements of the metal
decorations when the jewels were rotated. With the X-rays, however, I
could see exactly where to turn each jewel to open the egg. So that is
what I did. It was not particularly simple. Even with the X-ray images,
the function of each tiny wheel and lever was often obscure. <P>After twenty-two hours, I turned the last jewel into position, holding
my breath. The egg gave a satisfying clunk, and split along an irregular
line around the circumference. I reached for Khalid's Form of Words. A
wisp of dense pink smoke issued from the crack, and rotated gently into
a column reaching to the ceiling. The column thickened and grew more
substantial. I had expected the apparition to form almost
intantaneously, but it took nearly five minutes for the smoke to
coalesce into a humanoid figure some twelve feet in height. The djinn
was in the form of a muscular, rugged man, in white robes and holding a
scimitar, rather like a bearded Arnold Schwartzeneger dressed in a toga. Even with
the museum's generous ceiling height, the djinn had to sit on the floor
to avoid scraping his cranium on the decorative plaster mouldings. <P>I began to hear words in my mind; words which I hadn't heard in my ears.
The genie was talking to me. The lip-sync was awful, like one of these
dubbed martial arts movies, and, though the words were English words,
they didn't make a lot of sense, and were reminiscent of a Babelfish
translation. Gradually, the words became less random. <P>"FEAR NOT SENSE"  <P>OK. 'feel no fear', I supposed. I started to read from Khalid's Form of
Words: "In the name of..." <P>"VOCALISATION CEASE" <P>I continued to read out my modest requests. <P>"VOCALISATION CEASE!", a thunderous command. Taking the hint, I ceased
vocalising. <P>Khalid had told me to expect some resistance or prevarication, in the
event that I encountered a djinn and demanded favours. I suspected,
though, that this was more of a language problem. I hadn't expected
that. <P>The djinn glared at me for a long moment, then he spoke in my head: "OK.
Now you understand. Yes?" <P>"I understand. What about my three wishes?" <P>"There <I><b>are</b></I> no wishes at this time." <P>"But I released you from that egg." <P>"I entered the egg willingly, and could have opened it from within by
myself. Indeed, I have often spent time outside the egg. A hundred years
is a long time to spend compressed into such a small container." It was
strange to sense these words so clearly from the genie's unsynchronised lips, but I was
getting used to it. <P>"Why, then, were you inside the egg?" <P>"I was waiting for <I><b>you</b></I>." <P>"Me?" <P>"Not for you in person, but I was seeking  someone capable of solving
the problem of the egg. Which you have done." <P>"Please explain." <P><div class=tinyquote>Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<hr> One
thing at least is certain--This Life flies;<hr> One thing is certain and
the rest is Lies;<hr> The Flower that once has blown for ever
dies.</div> It was a long and rambling tale of journeys, jealousy,
anger, revenge, magic, punishment, ambition, sorrow and so on. Allah,
apparently, had ordained that no mercy be given or received. Some of it
sounded quite familiar to any scholar of The Arabian Nights. What
it amounted to was that our djinn here - let's call him Grafmeer, his
true name is a secret, apparently - had a long-standing feud with a
fellow djinn - Halimoss, another alias - in which Halimoss imprisoned Grafmeer's child
in an obsidian block. However, in his haste, Halimoss had failed to
remember the mechanism for the release of Grafmeer's son. So, though
Grafmeer eventually prevailed over Halimoss and enslaved him, neither
Halimoss, nor Grafmeer, nor anyone else, had yet mastered the trick of
opening the block. For hundreds of years, Grafmeer had been searching
for a sage who could solve the problem of the obsidian prison, without
success. The whole Arabian Nights' invasion of London, culminating in
the puzzle egg, was Grafmeer's desperate quest for a problem-solver. And
I was elected. <P>Grafmeer did not seem the type of entity who would take "No" for an answer. <P>"OK, Grafmeer. Bring it on." <P>"That is not possible. You must come with me." So saying, he scooped me
up in one muscular arm, and we ascended - the only possible word,
"ascended" - through the fabric of the museum as if the entire edifice
were made of mist. The journey to Mesopotamia took only a few minutes.
Despite the speed, there was no sensation of rushing air. I think I
occupied the entire time with one continuous scream of terror.  <P><p class=drop>Imagine a bowl of blue sky, out of which an impossibly brilliant sun
beat down on an infinite plain of grey dust sprinkled with pale stones.
I staggered under the impact of all those merciless photons as though
struck with a blunt instrument. I was persiring audibly within seconds.  <P>"Behind you." said Grafmeer. <P>I turned to see a black, shiny box, like an enormous dice (Yes, I know
the singular of dice is 'die', but I can never use the word in earnest) with faces
about ten feet square, floating  serenely some four feet from the rocky
ground. I quickly moved into its shade. Grafmeer, an even taller
presence now that there was room to stand up, was touching the black
cube in various places. Each time he pressed it, a pattern of white
squiggles temporarily appeared on the surface of the whole face, and one
section of the pattern would slide along, to be replaced by a new
pattern. I quickly realised that the squiggles were Arabic text, broken
up and turned sideways or upside down. <P>"It's writing!" I said. <P>"It amused Halimoss, may his spirit be reborn in a pig, to inscribe
a poem on each face of the cube so that, when all the poems were
correctly arranged, the cube would open. Then he scrambled the pattern
beyond repair, with my son inside." <P>I touched one face of the cube, and the writing flared up for a few
seconds as a section slid away and was replaced before fading again. <P>Grafmeer started in alarm: "Don't confuse it further! I shall make the
moves when you solve the problem. All the parts of all the poems are
always present on the surface of the object, but, unless each face of
the block contains a complete poem, it will not release my son." <P>I do not read Arabic, but I can tell when it is written upside down, or
sideways, or, as was most frequently found, truncated by one of the
invisible seams along which the pattern slid. It was just a symbol
jumble. <P>At first sight, it appeared hopeless, but it was worth a try, especially
if rewards were forthcoming. <P>I said: "I need to go back." <P>"Why? The box is here." <P>"I need my camera from the office." <P>"Camera? Is this the plural of 'camel' in your language?" asked Grafmeer. <P>I explained what the camera looked like and where it was. <P>"I will collect it. To carry you back and forth is most exhausting. Wait
here." <P>While I was saying: "Where would I go?", Grafmeer disappeared with a
whoosh of displaced air, leaving me sweating for England. <P>I realised this problem he wanted me  to solve was likely to be
insoluble, but even if I couldn't do it, I thought I'd be all right if I
just played along with him. Right now, he needed me, or he thought he
did, and I ought to keep it that way. If I admitted defeat immediately,
he might just leave me here in this arid wilderness in which I'd be
lucky to survive a day. <P>A solitary bird circled, black against the dome of the sky. For a
moment, I imagined it was a vulture, anticipating my imminent demise.
Then I realised that, in this fairytale dimension, it was more likely
to be a roc, which wouldn't bother to wait for its prey to expire before
dining. <P><div class=tinyquote>Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who<hr>
Before us pass'd the door of Darkness through,<hr>
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,<hr>
Which to discover we must travel too.</div>
Just when I feared Grafmeer was never coming back - after thirty seconds
or so - I heard the rush of his arrival, and he reappeared, holding the
camera between massive finger and gargantuan thumb. I took multiple
photographs of the faces and of the vertices of the block showing the
relationship of the faces to each other. The job was difficult, because
the inscriptions on a given face only remained visible for a short time,
and, on one occasion, Grafmeer changed the configuration by mistake, and
we had to start again. I had to lie on my back to photograph the lower
parts, and Grafmeer hoisted me like a cherry picker for the aerial
views. Eventually, I was satisfied that I had enough data to describe
the puzzle, even if I didn't have the solution yet. <P>"Take me back now, please." I asked. <P>"No!" he thundered, "You must open it now!" <P>I was scorched, soaked with perspiration, aching from the effort of
getting every image I needed, and mentally at the end of whatever tether
I had started the day with. "Listen! You've been working on this for
centuries, you tell me. Give me a break! It may take me weeks to figure
out. And one thing's for sure, I won't manage it out here. I will need
my computer. Take me back!" <P>"I will bring your computer!" <P>"Oh, yes, and there's a thirteen amp socket and a broadband connection
out here, is there?" <P>Grafmeer knitted his substantial brow and rumbled: "Beware, mortal. Do
not attempt to trick me. I may turn you into a marble statue of
yourself." <P>"If I'm out here much longer, I shall turn into a strip of dried meat
without your assistance." <P>Grafmeer was obviously accustomed to getting his way with people, but he
seemed to accept that he was not getting his son back here and now.
Another nightmarish flight brought us back to the museum. <P>"You have one day to find the solution," rumbled Grafmeer. <P>"Not enough. This is complicated. I need at least two weeks." At the
time, I feared there might be no solution at all, but a fortnight would
give me the chance to escape somewhere. On reflection, I later realised
that there was no escape from such as Grafmeer, so it was either solve
the problem, or perish in some fiendish Eastern fashion. <P>"I will wait!" pronounced Grafmeer. <P>"Not in here, please. There isn't room." <P>"It is a little uncomfortable," he conceded. "I shall disembody for a
while." So saying, he gradually sublimated into a pale pink smoke, and directed
himself into the empty milk bottle most commonly used to contain water
for use in soldering and to irrigate the weary plants on the window sill
when someone remembered to do so. The bottle glowed dimly. <P><div class=tinyquote>But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays<hr>
Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;<hr>
Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,<hr>
And one by one back in the Closet lays.</div>
I set about the tedious task of sorting out which bits of poem belonged
on which face of the obsidian block. I was lucky. In order not to give
the game away, I posted a few fragments of my photographs on a
university Arabic forum, and was quickly rewarded with the information
that they were from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. I was given a pointer
to a website that had many stanzas in Arabic and in Fitzgerald's English
translation, which I must say is a rather flowery rendering of the
original. With a bit of effort, I was able to identify among the hundred
and one verses the six stanzas represented on the six faces of the cube.
After that, it was dead easy. <P><p class=drop>"Yeah, right," said Jez. "It's all a bit obvious ter you, innit? But I
can't get me 'ead around 'ow ya solved it so quick when he'd been
workin' on it for years." <P>I sipped my vodka martini, paid for with a credit card whose balance was
perpetually paid off from my seemingly inexhaustible Swiss bank account. <P>"Well," I replied, "when I'd colour-coded all the bits of the poems, it
was obvious it was just a four by four Rubik's cube." <P>"A wot?" <P>"Rubik's cube. A sort of puzzle I was given when I was a kid. Normally
they were three by three, but you can get more complicated ones, like
four by four. I could never solve mine." <P>"So if you couldn't solve a smaller one, 'ow did ya solve this one?" <P>"The internet, of course. I ordered a four by four cube from an online
toy shop, got it next day, re-labelled the individual faces in the same
way as the photos of the real cube, then used a solution off the web to
solve it, and delivered the moves to Grafmeer. " <P>Jez had glazed over by the time I'd finished. "Wottever," he remarked,
and sniffed.
The enhanced charisma that Grafmeer had conferred upon me didn't
seem to work with Jez. <P>He drained his pint, shouted "Gotta go!" to the few of us littered in
the bar like flotsam left by a high tide, and rode his flying carpet
towards the double doors in a surfer's crouch. The carpet was a small
gift from me for pointing me at Khalid's Form of Words, which worked a
treat, by the way. <P>"Oi!" shouted the barman, "No bloody magic carpets in 'ere! You carry it
outside on the street and use it there!" <P>"Piss off, Terry," replied Jez, bumping open the doors with his
shoulder, and leaving.  <P>"Where was that bugger educated?" grumbled Terry, "London College of
Lightning Repartee?" <P>I discovered that, despite being rich, effectively immortal and oozing
charisma, I could still grin at Terry's tired joke. <P><P><small>Copyright &copy; Gil Williamson 2010 All Rights Reserved </small>
