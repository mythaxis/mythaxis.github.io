<div><i>Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting 
convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day. - <b>Bertrand Russell.</b></i>
<p class=drop>It's a short story. As short as the lives
of the flies that my friend liked to kill, but not too short to
demonstrate the consequences thereof. <P>So, yes, my friend liked to kill flies. <P>Dan lived in a broken down old apartment building where the walls were
peeling, the carpet managed to smell like dog without even the presence
of a canine, and the plates and utensils in his rusting kitchen and
bathroom sinks were classified under the term "scrubbing optional." <P>As for Dan, he was a dumpy guy that managed to remain greasy a lot of
the time, when he was incredibly scruffy and wearing the stereotypical
grunge to go along with it all. Don't get me wrong. Appearances aside,
he was an otherwise good man who liked to play World of Warcraft, could
tell the most entertaining stories of how he was fictitiously laid after
a few beers, and had a genocidal compulsion against flies. <P>I'm still puzzled about it to this very day. I mean, you would think
with all the filth he accumulated, Dan would have been more tolerant of
his nonhuman neighbors in the inevitable ecosystem he created for
himself. And indeed, he had no problem with the earwigs, and even the
spiders. No, he had no problem with the spiders at all. <P>You see, Dan liked to kill flies in a variety of ways. Sometimes, he
would just use a basic Swiss-hole flyswatter. Other times, he would just
spray them. This was just a matter of course really. Then, he just got
nasty. Dan owned a BB gun. I would be hard-pressed to tell you now what
model it was, considering I never really had one, but it was one that
shot out hard, multicolored pellets. Sometimes, as we were gaming on our
laptops, he would reach over and, before anything, he would shoot a fly
in midair. Sometimes, he would even get a few shots off, which annoyed
me because sometimes the pellets just whizzed over my head or brushed my
cheek. <P><div class=pullquote>I was really philosophical at that point. Well, as philosophical as any drunk
gets at two in the morning.</div>But no matter how many times I swore at him, he would just not stop. And
you can say a lot about my friend, but he was an excellent shot. There
were pieces of fly limbs scattered everywhere under the bright paint of
those pellets. Those, and the others, however, were the lucky ones. I
won't even go into the ones that were not always killed instantly. The
ones that had their wings shattered, or their legs ripped off. <P>Sometimes, I suspect that he honestly trapped some of them in the window
screen and literally watched their strength slowly ebb away. That was, of
course, when he didn't feed them, or remnants of them, to the spiders that
he kept in the corners. One time, I asked him why he did it. I'm not
sure I remember, but I do think it was something to do with the noise
that they made. The buzzing sound. Something in the vibrational tone of
these insects bothered Dan so much that it moved him to specific acts of
cruelty towards them. Now, I don't like the sound of flies either. Their
droning reminds me too much of wasps and hornets - insects I don't know
if I'm allergic to and otherwise do not want to find out. <P>But even I started to feel really sorry for them, and found this
compulsion almost weirder than Renfield's eating habits from Dracula. I
even told him that maybe if he cleaned his place up more, there would be
less of them. But according to Dan, it was clean enough. The waxy
pale flypaper on the walls, with its macabre trophies, was supposed to be
a testament to this. And besides, he claimed that he should be able to
keep his place any damn way he wanted and that he was the one who
suffered everything else in it to live. He would just not, as he put it,
suffer flies. <P>Now, I didn't go there often and only when I was stranded at night when
the buses stopped, or we came back from a particularly strenuous game of
D&D. To be honest, I couldn't stand the place. There was something
really bad aside from the smell of ass and antiseptics. I couldn't
really express it then. <P>Then, there was the night. <P>We'd been gaming and drinking a lot. I crashed on the couch while Dan
went into his room. As tired as I was, I couldn't get to sleep. I was
really philosophical at that point. Well, as philosophical as any drunk
gets at two in the morning. There actually was a full moon shining from
one of the windows. The white light from the view was probably one of
the few beautiful things about that place. It was actually really
bright. We'd turned the other lights off, and I just lay there thinking
about stuff. <P>My thoughts were not very original, as semi-inebriated musings go. I
wondered about souls. About death. I thought about how we knew that we
had souls. Or was it that we were just machines that would blink off the
moment our hearts -- our sources of power faded and turned off and parts
fell apart? Much like the flies that Dan killed. Descartes, a
philosopher almost always quoted when someone is at least somewhat
wasted, said that animals were just machines that acted on
pre-programmed impulses and could not feel pain or anything. He said
they were soulless things. <P>I was as skeptical about that pyjama-wearing Frenchman's delusions as I
was about that soulless vampire bullshit in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Then I started thinking about ghosts and other stuff we touched on at
our friend's when were role-playing. My last thought was something along
the lines of just how much flypaper was on the walls, and how many small
bodies were stuck onto the pale white substance forever. <P>I'm not sure if I woke before, or after I heard the sound. It was a low,
but reverberating sound. My teeth were vibrating from it. The windows
from the outside were still white with the moon, but the light seemed to
be swirling around on the walls. <P>Or so I thought. <P>I was very disoriented from waking up so soon and I was sure as hell
that I was somewhat under the influence. To this day, I hope that it was
the alcohol whose influence I found myself under. <P>The walls were squirming. Pulsing really. Maybe it was a trick of the
light or very bad vision on my part. But what was really disturbing was
the black bits on the fly paper walls. I could have sworn they were
twitching. Underneath dust, paint and stickiness they moved like one
great organism. In the moonlight, they were all pale and slowly, they
began to extract themselves from the wall. I wish this delusion rivaling
an LSD trip ended there. <P>But it got worse. <P>Accompanied by a white powdery mist, mangled fly parts joined the mass
from the wall. The moon robbed them of any colour other than the one it
gave them. They crawled from under the screen, and the corners, and the
garbage, and even the sink and the bathroom -- where I strongly suspect
Dan drowned them. They all molded together like never-born maggots, or a
cocoon of death until this malformed shape of multiple broken wings, and
twisted limbs, and dead insect eyes, and powder, and hurt buzzed
ominously and slowly away from me. <P>Like an undead Zerg Overlord, it hovered like an ivory pustule of small
horror and pain and floated across the room. <P>To Dan's room. <P>I was on the couch when I woke up the next day. My head was aching and
it took a while for my eyes to focus in the really bright sunlight. And
then I screamed. <P>You would have too. The place was almost entirely clean. Too damn clean.
The fly bodies were all gone. All of them. The wax paper wasn't even on
the walls anymore. <P>But that wasn't what really scared me. What really scared me was the
white powder coating everything, with greater parts of it in the centre
of the room ... and in the line trailing to Dan's doorway. <P>They never found Dan. And I got as far away from that apartment building
as I could. I'd heard all about things like ectoplasm as psychic
residue, and poltergeists and places as things being charged with the
collective energies of people who died especially violent deaths. These
things could pool together and sometimes, apparently, gain something not
unlike sentience or intent. What I didn't know was that the same
principles could also be applied to nonhuman lives. To animals. To
insects. <P>To this very day, whenever I get a fly in my room, I put it on a Kleenex
and throw it out of my door to go elsewhere. I literally will not, and
cannot hurt a fly again. I won't hurt a fly because they know us. They
know our homes, our food, our garbage, and our shit. <P>Beelzebub. The Lord of the Flies. <P>I could go on, but I won't. <P><small>&copy; Matthew Kirshenblatt 2009 All Rights Reserved </small>
