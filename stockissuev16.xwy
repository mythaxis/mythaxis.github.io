[*BLURB] Welcome to the 16th issue of Mythaxis.
 


[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop><p class =drop>I present to you Mythaxis'
16th collection of short speculative fiction, the July 2015 edition.
 
<p class = drop>My enthusiasm for short science fiction and fantasy
remains undimmed. Very often, an attractive original idea entertains
for ten pages but could probably not be sustained for a couple of
hundred pages, let alone a series of novels.

I think particularly of:<ul><li>Ray Bradbury's <I>The Veldt</I>,
<li>Roger Zelazny's <I>The Doors of his Face, the Lamps of his
Mouth</I>, <li>James Blish's <I>A Case of Conscience</I>, <li>William
Gibson's <I>The Gernsback Continuum</I>, <li>Cordwainer Smith's <I>The
Game of Rat and Dragon</I>, <li>Bruce Sterling's <I>Bicycle
Repairman</I> <li>Arthur C. Clarke's <I>The Nine Billion Names of
God</I>, <li>Asimov's <I>The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated
Thiotimoline</I>, <li>Ian Watson's <I>Slow Birds</I>, <li>Jorge Luis
Borges' <I>The Aleph</I>, <li>Jack Vance's <i>The Dragon
Masters</i>.</ul>I find that I could fill several
pages with short stories that have stuck in my mind for years, many for
decades.

That is the tradition I aim to uphold with Mythaxis. Read and enjoy.

[*BLURB]  "A necessary monster." <small> Jorge Luis Borges</small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">"Who follows me?" called the virgin,
without fear.

"I, sweet thing," murmured the wyrm, unseen, its voice made silken with
deceits.

"I only feed men, and clean their things," she replied with a dismissive
air and continued on her way towards her village in the cove, where
fishing boats sailed out at dawn and dusk, like now.

"There are more hungers than one, maiden." It used her Greek, though any
tongue of men was its to command. It used the flattering word, for
virgins fear that truth at times.

"You want my sister's service." She glanced back with a smile, seeing
no-one. To the north the soldiers' camp was become only shadows, upon a
beach of tan sands greening with the growing dark, against a sea of
purple, beneath a dying ember sky.


Her dark eyes reflected it all. The wyrm's reflected only her.

"Can she be as lovely?" The girl flushed at the flattery, but did not
pause again. "I ask truly, though I have eyes for no beauty but your
own."

"Quite lovely enough for a soldier's relief, which you would not find
with me. She is quick to share, and generous with her time. My price
would be a life's length-" the wyrm grinned, though she did not know it
"-and soon-dead men are not rich enough in years for me."

"No man am I," said the wyrm in its true voice, and approached as she
faltered, transfixed.

<p class=drop>The virgin lay restless in the wyrm's stomach. The great
beast twisted and coiled on its hoard, unable to settle, much like its
meal. It rolled onto its back, undulous like a river, baring its belly
as the mystic heat of the virgin's untapped loins stoked its own fire.

It would need that soon. Not a needing like the compulsion which had led
it to consume her, fiery though that was, but the more literal
necessity.

It would need flame, as those seeking vengeance inevitably followed a
meal.

In this era, with humans abound on every inch of the world like fleas on
a rat's back, wyrmkind had been driven into only the most secluded
places. Now, instead of roosting atop some fine crag beneath the sky,
the wyrm dwelt in caverns by the surface, a shallow seep-water pool to
reflect its treasures before snaking its way on to the sea. It had
become as a tapeworm in that same rat's starving gut.<div
class=pullquote>It was mankind's fancy that virginity's sole value was
in its taking</div>

The wyrm seethed. Forced by mankind's ever increasing numbers to hide,
then by hunger to emerge and risk its precious skin. Forced to claim its
sacrifices, not simply receive them from cowering crowds. Forced to
provoke futile pursuits by little mobs - its seething became edged with
satisfaction - who in turn were forced to breach its narrow passages by
lonely ones and twos, no match for the wyrm without scrabbling
multitudes at their back.

Two types predominated, as it perceived them. First, those who revenged
themselves out of love (or so they told themselves, though the
feverishness with which each man gripped his weapon was suggestive more
of base lust). Second, those who sought revenge out of duty (or so they
told themselves, for duty done at a king's command is more properly
termed <i>obedience</i>).

The wyrm knew of human fancies and deceits, all the more powerful for
being directed solely at themselves. Bravery was the self-deceit of the
dutiful. In mounted ranks, King Louis' dragoons had come, but
the rolling eyes and anxious stamping of their steeds gave lie to the
deeper fear possessing each rider. It was communicated with every
movement of their bodies, beyond the reach of lying tongues to deny, and
their horses heard the message well.

But Louis' people heard his fear too, and no denial ever held back the
guillotine's bite.

And fancies-it was mankind's fancy that virginity's sole value was in
its taking, fools that they were. Even its bearers only preserved it
with that purpose in mind, aside from the greater fools who sacrificed
their true nature kneeling, knees tight together, at one altar or
another.

What did any of them know of the enduring virgin's power? Urgency
preserved, building, overwhelming. An unquenchable fire, kept ever
thirsty for the slaking? They knew nothing.

The wyrm's own loins were cold as gold. Only when the fire of its breath
was extinguished would its sexuality begin to burn, fuelling the need to
seek out another fading serpent with which to mate, lay eggs with and,
ultimately, expire beside, young nestling in their coils.

Yet as long as there were virginal fonts to sup from, the wyrm pledged
it would maintain its fire. Not for it the civil choice, to quietly age
and sire a fading future. It would roar, and live it.

<p class=drop>Finally, from the seaward passage came at last the sound
of men approaching, the overlaying echoes of faltering footsteps hinting
at a dutiful mass-but, as their source neared, the echoes synchronised
into that of only one man.

The wyrm watched as he limped into the cavern, his military dress
slovenly and stained, hair lank across a handsome, no doubt lustful
brow.

"There must be fever in my blood," the visitor said, "for there is a
dragon in my eyes."

"I am no fever dream," said the wyrm, in its clicking, cracking speech.

"Both, then," he replied, "for I am more unwell than wine has ever made
me."

"You are come to avenge my prey, the virgin." Heat flooded the wyrm,
rising like liquor in its veins and throat. It shone beneath its skin,
within its eyes, behind its teeth.

"Virgins no longer drive me." The man sneered as he stepped forward, his
eyes swimming in their sockets. The wyrm's glow made him radiant. "I
seek experience, not the lack of it."

The creature paused, its endless memory pricked. It knew of human arts
and letters. It knew the vain and petty poem. The old story had
presented the perfect form of the lustful revenger. Not the preening
lord's version, though. He recast the plunderer <i>Don Juan</i> in the
wyrm's new role: sought after, not the seeker.

"I know your way with words," the wyrm said, scarcely believing the
evident truth. "You are the poet."

The man shook his head. "I am a soldier, come to throw the cursed
Ottomans from out of noble Greece." He drew a sword from his belt sash
with a flourish, swayed a moment, and stabbed the blade into the cavern
floor for balance. "Though I may never have the chance to shed blood for
her. My doctors seek to bleed me dry before battle is even joined."<div
class=lpullquote>"And what poor brew will quench your appetites once the
finest vintage is consumed?"</div>

"Then shed my blood, if you can, little lord," said the wyrm, delighted,
"or I will drink what remains of yours."

"My flavour will be too rich," he said, and looked down at the blade
supporting him. "To taste me once is to long for me always. And what
poor brew will quench your appetites once the finest vintage is
consumed?"

The wyrm chuckled, a sound like pebbles skittering down a cliff face,
loosening huge boulders to follow crashing in their wake.

"Isn't the final taste the sweetest?" it asked.

"It is the saddest."

The man pulled his sword's point from the ground, looked with disdain
upon his weapon, then swooned, leaning on the wall to keep his feet.

"If so, I shall mourn," the wyrm declared, and glided towards him on the
flexing striations of its belly, winding back and forth, its smile
gaping open, all needle teeth and fuming heat.

The poet tossed his sword aside, heedless of the wyrm's approach. The
blade tumbled in the air and into the wyrm's yawning gape, piercing its
throat, opening the fire's path and spilling it out into tender places
only meant for virgin flesh.

The wyrm coiled upon itself, writhed, knotted, and died.

Byron stared at the mound of gold, at the burning hallucination, then
rubbed his eyes and wandered back to the surface, to the camp, to enter
mortal combat with his doctors.

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">Engaged in one of his eight Ritual Feuds,
the autarch Hohax had arrived early with his pouch of bargaining scrolls
at the stronghold of Furfeth the tree-stealer, and was making his way on
foot up the overgrown path which led to the great bronze gates, when the
hem of his cloak snagged on a wild sharkthorn bush.  As he stooped to
detach it the air scintillated around him.  For a moment he thought it
was simply fractured sunlight from the dew-laden spiders’ webs, but then
with an abrupt lurch he found himself clutching for a handhold as he
slid on his back down an unfamiliar loamy bank towards the unmistakable
sound of fast-flowing water.   Luckily his descent was checked by a
tangle of exposed roots.  He brushed the damp soil from his clothes,
clambered to his feet, and with a distinct chill that was not entirely
physical, realised that wherever he now was, it was already dusk, and
that he had dropped his pouch of scrolls on Furfeth’s wretched path.

According to custom, when the statutory period of thirty years had
elapsed following his (albeit unintentional) departure from the Realm,
he was duly designated Hohax the Absent, and became a legitimate subject
for a Quest.

Tjörsfal – in Tongue of the Realm literally &#91;the place&#93; beyond
the Veil - impinged obliquely on the Realm in regions subject to
unpredictable fluctuations in coherence.  In practical terms, this meant
that a suspected Veil, the fuzzy patch of air associated with a
dimensional intersection, might turn out to be only a cloud of spores
from a hippock plant, or an unfortunate incidence of blurred vision.
Moreover, finding a reliable transition point had always been something
of a dangerous gamble.  These phenomena were infrequent, appeared
randomly, and seldom persisted for more than a few hours.  The Realm was
devoid of theoretical physicists, but its denizens were strong on
responses to challenge, and so there had developed the rite of the
Perennial Quest.  .  It was open to any autarch to undertake alone a
search for lost predecessors, some of whom, like Hohax, having slipped
through a Veil by accident and failed to locate a viable exit, had been
involuntary exiles in Tjörsfal for many decades.  The women of the
Realm, none of whom were known to have become Absent, had so far
stoically refrained from active Questing, and seemed always to be able
to justify remaining Realmside of a Veil.

Not for nothing was Thagdar known, both in the Realm and in Tjörsfal, as
Thagdar the Immutable, although the precise reason for this was
disputed, and after all this time his own memory tended to be a trifle
unreliable.  An autarch's longevity was not without its advantages, but
in retrospect one aeon was much like another, and trivial details like
epithets soon lost their significance.

Thagdar had been through the Veil in his youth, sometime during his
reckless eighties or nineties, when the need to demonstrate his worth
had been at its most demanding.   He had probably been trying to impress
Nereol, or Tirdra, or another of that generation of nubile women who
comported themselves with such a teasing blend of aloofness and allure.
By now they would be well into stately middle age, and leading
respectable professional lives in lawfangling, prattlecraft or enwitting
of the young.<div
class=pullquote>Crouching with half-open jaws, the ugly tusked creature
he had disturbed, easily the size of a large rathound, stared up at him
with small baleful eyes.</div>

He remembered, or fancied he remembered, the considerable fuss aroused
in his community when a Veil had been reported in Noordelsvald, barely a
boulder’s heft from his own keep.  Summoned by clatterhorns and beacons,
on such occasions all local autarchs would gather at Council as rapidly
as possible near the site to determine which of them would venture forth
on a Quest.  The first to step forward would always be given preference,
although sometimes, if there were two or more eager for the privilege,
lots would need to be drawn.  In rare cases where all present had
previously Quested, news of the Veil would be sent to those living
further afield, until a willing volunteer was found.  The successful
candidate would be furnished with a list of The Absent, and such details
of their place and time of departure as were known.

Thagdar tried to recall how it had felt to make what must have been a
momentous decision.  He knew he had stepped forward quickly, thus
earning the approval of his elders and the admiration of his peers.  The
Noordelsvald Veil was a wavering opacity above an area of discoloured
ground which long ago had been occupied by copper-smelters.  The site
had been swiftly cordoned off with stakes to which warning ribbons had
been tied.  After a formal departure ceremony, equipped with his list, a
day’s provisions, and a few other necessities, Thagdar had ventured into
the shimmering cloud……

The sound of encouraging cries from his fellow autarchs ceased.  There
was a moment’s dizziness, before he was assailed by a sensory overload;
a bewildering mosaic of brightness and shadow, thickly cloying heat, the
fetid stink of animal dung.  He looked down.  His boots had sunk to the
ankles in a thick floor of decaying leaf mould, sheared stems and fallen
branches, quivering in places with unseen activity beneath the surface.
To his immediate left he was suddenly aware of a low curdled snarling.
Crouching with half-open jaws, the ugly tusked creature he had
disturbed, easily the size of a large rathound, stared up at him with
small baleful eyes.  This was his first sentient encounter in Tjörsfal,
and Thagdar’s immediate task was to survive.

He carried no weapons, other than his paring blade, which he was
reluctant to blunt by whittling a spear.  His burning-glass was of no
immediate use, and in any case, judging from the ferocity of the snarls,
there was not enough time to improvise a defence.  There was a useful
looking stick within reach, but he decided to try a placatory approach,
and dug into his provisions sack.  It took him the best part of an hour
of quiet coaxing, and almost his entire supply of savoury nutcakes,
before there was a mutual acceptance that neither beast nor autarch
posed a threat to the other.  The creature retreated, and Thagdar was
able to concentrate on taking better stock of his surroundings.

Knowledge of Tjörsfal was garnered sporadically from autarchs who had
successfully happened upon a Veil through which to return, usually
alone, or exceptionally, with one of the formerly Absent:  Bledbard the
Inquisitive, Ygmors the Wily, Uldfane the Dissatisfied….  The
accumulated information was gradually disseminated for the benefit of
those in the Realm, so that those venturing on a Quest (or making an
unbidden journey like Hohax) would have some awareness of the range of
possible environments and climatic conditions that might be encountered,
and a piecemeal overview of the inhabitants.  Attempts had been made to
construct maps, but it had not yet proved possible to join the disparate
sections into a comprehensive whole, and the true physical extent of
Tjörsfal remained unknown.  Although borders were well established,
mostly imposed by features such as mountains and bodies of water, there
was no indigenous tradition of Tjörsfal cartography, as so little
migration took place between enclaves.

One significant item of information retrieved by the autarchs, and which
almost certainly had a bearing on Tjörsfalers’ seeming disinclination to
travel, was that in much of Tjörsfal Veils were generally regarded with
superstitious dread; not only because of their link with sporadically
emerging autarchs, but because no native could approach a Veil without
experiencing unendurable headaches.  Anecdotal evidence hinted that on
rare occasions severe comas had been caused by a Veil materializing in a
populous area.

Around him towered a twisted mass of ropy vegetation, struggling to
reach up through a maze of leaves to where bright shards of light broke
through the high canopy.  He glanced behind him, where for now the Veil
still persisted, its flickering haze blending into the chiaroscuro of
the forest while making the view through it impenetrable.  Having no
clue as to his bearings, Thagdar began picking his way through a
glistening network of stems and vines, trying to avoid the beads of
gummy resin which caught at his clothing.  He found a thick fallen
stalk, almost his own height, its leaves already completely consumed,
but sturdy enough to serve as a means to prod the ground, or push aside
obstructive spikes and tendrils.  So began the Quest of Thagdar the
Immutable.

In terms of an autarch’s lifespan it was a remarkably short episode –
barely as long as a year, but time enough to provide future historians
with debatable events.  Those initial weeks spent in the forest had
probably been the most exacting, having to adapt to the sticky heat,
avoid lurking predators with fangs or mandibles, forage for food which
was not instantly emetic or impossibly out of reach.  He learned how to
use threadlike vines, which had great tensile strength, knotting them
into a mesh strong enough to serve as a protective podlike hammock.  By
the afternoon of the twentieth day Thagdar noticed that the floor of the
forest had an increasingly steep downward slope, and as the canopy
thinned he finally emerged at the bank of a broad sluggish river, across
which he could see a distant cluster of huts.
 
He found a suitably secluded spot where he was able to rinse the sweat
and grime from his body, and subject his clothes to a thorough wash,
afterwards hanging them on a convenient spiny bush, and allowing them to
dry in the heat of the oddly bloated-looking sun.  He converted his
hammock into a casting-net, with which he scooped a substantial number
of fishlike creatures from the shallows, and at last made practical use
of his burning-glass to create a cooking fire.  As the first protein he
had consumed for several weeks, he found the meal unusually satisfying,
and to his considerable relief it was not rejected by his digestive
system.  He proceeded to cook the uneaten portion of his catch, and
packaged it securely in a large leaf for later consumption.

One benefit of an autarch’s longevity was a capacity for patience.
Thagdar was in no rush to cross the river.  He systematically explored
the stretch of bank along the forest’s edge, ascertaining that there was
no bridge as far as he could see in either direction.  He tested the
depth of the water, studied its currents, assessed what natural
materials were available in the vicinity, and returned to the forest.
Here he began collecting a quantity of the sticky resin he had
previously tried so hard to avoid, as well as the fallen arm-thick
hollow stems of a tough bamboo-like plant.  After some days he had
lashed together a serviceable raft which he caulked with the resin, and
using a long stripped branch of a denser wood as a makeshift pole,
propelled himself safely across the expanse of water towards the huts.

It was mid-afternoon when he reached the far side, using his versatile
hammock to moor the raft to a bankside sapling.  The huts, arranged in
groups of five around a well-established central tree, were solidly
built timber structures with thick glazed windows and a porch-like
entrance under a thatched roof.  Around the base of each tree was a
sturdy pentagonal bench. There were no signs of life apart from a few
rust-coloured creatures with stubby wings scavenging lethargically in
the dirt.  They ignored his approach.  Thagdar stooped to peer in
through the windows of the first few huts.  Although there were obvious
signs of recent habitation, they appeared to be deserted.  Thagdar
decided that after his recent exertions it would do no harm to rest for
a while.  He made himself as comfortable as possible on the bench, and
was asleep within seconds.


<p class=drop>He awoke to a subdued cacophony of voices.  Stretching his
limbs, he yawned, and rose to a sittting position.  The voices abruptly
quietened. Beyond the pool of shadow cast by the tree at his back sat an
assembly of villagers.  At a glance he estimated there must be at least
a hundred of them, seated on plump circular cushions that reminded him
of pancakes he had eaten as a child.  A figure detached itself from the
foremost row, and took a few steps towards Thagdar, keeping his eyes
downcast. Unlike the others, who wore knee-length garments, he was clad
in what Thagdar took to be a ceremonial robe, and flaunted a necklace
of large polished stones set in a bright metal chain of complex design.

‘’I am Pume, head of these Eruen pentages,’’ he stated in a confident
tenor, curiously accented, but recognizably Tongue of the Realm.  ‘’How
may we be of service to you, O Tark?  It is rare indeed that our world
is honoured by a visit from beyond the Veil.’’  This last phrase was
accompanied by a ritual gesture: back of hand raised with fingers
splayed across closed eyes.  The same gesture swept like a wave through
the seated pentagers.  Pume stepped back deferentially as Thagdar stood
up, amid an apprehensive murmuring from the crowd.

Thagdar’s voice was a full octave deeper than Pume’s, and its resonance
carried his words to the furthest pentager.  ‘’Thagdar of the Realm.  I
greet you and your people, Pume of the Eruen.  I come in Quest of others
of my kind.  He smiled down at them.  ‘’You need not fear me.  I mean
you no harm, and have no other objective, except, in due course, to find
a Veil through which to return.’’  Arms lifted again at the word
‘’Veil’’, and a sea of hands splayed like a reef of choreographed
starfish.

‘’If any here have heard rumours of another Autarch, no matter how
distant, I bid you bring news to me, and I will continue my journey in
whatever direction it leads.  Meanwhile, I would welcome a private place
to rest, and later perhaps a little refreshment, if it can be spared.’’

Pume looked up boldly.  ‘’Gladly, O Tark.  We have already prepared a
pallet for you in our Summoning Hall, which is where we gathered in
concern and astonishment when first you were seen braving the great
water.  We will happily provide as much sustenance as you require.  As
for your noble Quest, I regret that no others of your kind are known to
be within the reaches of our Eruen land, but we will send our swiftest
runners to make enquiries of our neighbours to the west and north, the
Kerrel-ren.  South and east, of course, flows the wide Shrepp, on which
we Eruen are not accustomed to float.   Our runners will return within a
week, and with fortune’s blessing, may bring news to please you.’’ Pume
bowed, and Thagdar was escorted to the Summoning Hall, where he was duly
given spacious quarters, and offered trays of local delicacies. Among
these were neatly curled strips of smoked meat in a paste of sweet
herbs, a thick spicy soup sprinkled with flakes of baked fish, a medley
of fresh fruits, some with edible decorations, and sucking-sticks of a
sun-dried bean which he was told induced (at least in the Eruen) a sense
of mild euphoria.<div
class=lpullquote>The voices from the ground were deemed to be the
ultimate test for Witbleg</div>

Unfortunately, the news from Kerrel-ren was largely negative.  The first
runner to return, from the north, could find no-one with any memory of
an autarch visiting that territory.  From the west came no more than
tantalising hints.  Lorp, a wizened documentarian, had unearthed some
fragmentary records of his grandfather’s which told of the brief sojourn
of an autarch in the mountainous region known as Ennet, which lay to the
far west.  Slight though this information was, for Thagdar it was at
least a starting-point.  He consulted his list of The Absent, but there
was no way of telling precisely which of them had passed through Ennet.
However, the dating of Lorp’s fragments narrowed the possibilities.  As
Thagdar had now confirmed from his own experience, the length of days
and nights in Tjörsfal seemed little different from that in the Realm,
and if the years were also comparable, despite the odd appearance of the
sun, it was likely that the autarch referred to must have been one of
those known to have left the Realm during his own childhood.  Of these,
Uldfane the Dissatisfied was among the few notably retrieved, having
been found living with stoical resentment as a desert nomad by Jodric
the Delirious.  By Thagdar’s calculations, that left either Molgrim
(formerly the Nimble) or Witbleg (formerly the Unsurprised). 

In return for their hospitality, Thagdar instructed a few of the more
intrepid Eruen in the craft of simple boat-building, and in basic
principles of navigation, allaying their fears about the hazards of
floating on the Shrepp, pointing out the advantages of fishing in deeper
waters, and even of crossing to the far shore, where he described to
their open-eyed amazement the potential storehouse of resources that lay
beyond.

The autarch Molgrim the Nimble had famously escaped pursuit by a
frightened pack, school, herd or wedge of fin-beaked homing terrapins,
as they rampaged through his vineyard, snapping at anything that moved.
What had frightened them was unknown; a sudden cloud, perhaps, or the
distant wail of a taunting-horn.  Wisely, on hearing the peculiar
clacking thunder of their approach, Molgrim had pulled a basket over his
head, and lain face down in an irrigation furrow until they had passed.
It is questionable whether total stillness is strictly equivalent to
being quick on one’s feet, but autarchs tended to be stuck with
whichever soubriquet earned the greatest approval in the shortest time.

Witbleg’s reputation was probably more securely based.  Historical
prattlecraft confirmed that what had begun as simple observation of his
equable behaviour in response to unexpected events had gradually
developed into a kind of sport.  Among the short-lived, such activities
would be called ‘pranks’ or ‘practical jokes’, but autarchs had both the
time and the sophistication to plan sudden events in meticulous detail,
and, more importantly, well in advance.  Some autarch clans had
conspired for generations to test Witbleg’s unflappability.  They would
meet in secret in each other’s keeps and strongholds, or at an agreed
neutral venue, at times when Witbleg had been reliably lured elsewhere,
away from the wood-carving at which he was particularly adept, and which
occupied much of his time.

Various experiments were conducted, involving elaborately produced
mirages, dyed snow, briefly displaced or duplicated landmarks…   Witbleg
remained untroubled, even by the discovery that, seemingly overnight,
the foliage of the trees which enclosed much of his land had turned a
strangely flickering blue.  On closer inspection it could be seen that
they had become populated with a species of bat previously unknown to
the area,  Something about the trees was clearly attracting them, as
they clung fluttering to every available branch and twig, twittering
insanely for almost an entire day before vanishing en masse as quickly
as they had apparently arrived, leaving behind only peculiarly acrid
spatterings of guano around each tree, which affected the alkalinity of
the soil for many months afterwards.

The voices from the ground were deemed to be the ultimate test for
Witbleg.  Considerable time and planning had been invested in the
construction of an extensive system of underground pipes.  Each pipe had
an appropriately coded speaking cone at one end.  The tower in which
these converged was equipped with farlooking tubes, so that Witbleg’s
movements could be observed and matched to the relevant concealed
emerging-point.  At the far end, protected by a fine mesh, and carefully
angled so as not to allow water to seep in, each pipe would be
camouflaged by a thorny shrub or a clump of sharpgrass.  The camouflaged
ends happened to lie along Witbleg’s habitual walking routes.

A thin mist swirled around his ankles as Witbleg strode along the narrow
path that led from the south-west gate of his keep towards the sea.  He
breathed in the pleasantly damp air, savouring as the day warmed, the
strengthening tang of gently decomposing marine organisms, looking
forward to setting out on the water for a few challenging hours in the
craft he had recently had refurbished, carving the prow himself with the
emblematic head of a swordbird.  A voice near his feet called his name.
Odd, he thought, pausing for a moment to frown at its apparent source;
unquestionably a small bush, not normally given to communication.  He
reflected that he had had a similar experience the previous day, when he
had thought he heard a hollow laugh emanating from a tussock, but he was
not in the habit of conversing with plants, and continued on his way.

Eventually, the conspirators had to concede that for all their
expenditure of time and effort, it had not been possible to evoke from
Witbleg more than a slightly raised eyebrow or at most a vaguely
tolerant smile, and their enthusiastic tests gradually dwindled to an
embarrassed halt.  These events had taken place while Thagdar was still
in his infancy.

<p class=drop>Thagdar travelled west, passing through Kerrel-ren, where
rumours of his presence among the Eruen had already spread through an
excited populace.  He was greeted by a selected entourage of twenty or
so respectful citizens of mixed age and gender.  Most of these were
skilled in different disciplines: eldersong, plant-lore, speculance,
fabrication, water-taming…   They were clearly eager both to learn and
to offer assistance if possible.  A few of them seemed more detached and
permanently watchful, automatically forming a protective cordon whenever
crowds pressed too close.  Thagdar tolerated the attention, spoke
reticently of the Realm, and offered practical advice where he thought
it would be understood and implemented.  The journey across Kerrel-ren
was facilitated by the provision of a recently developed ingenious
rolling carriage which he was told operated by the compression of water.
At the front a harnessed driver controlled a steering bar and a
mechanism to engage the motor and regulate speed.  Passengers sat in
cushioned seats suspended in parallel rows from a sturdy frame, while at
the back, mounted horizontally, a large wheel whined noisily inside a
sealed housing, conveying its energy to the propelling rollers by a
devious means they attempted to explain to Thagdar, who, unfamiliar with
this kind of mechanical engineering, and inwardly reminiscing about
Witbleg, failed to give the propulsive details his full attention.

For all its convenience, the carriage had not been designed to
accommodate someone of Thagdar’s physique, and it was to his relief that
they eventually reached what was literally the end of the road, in the
foothills of Ennet.  Here he took leave of his assigned companions, who
with a courteous display of flustered embarrassment, made it clear that
they were regrettably not able to venture with him into the mountainous
terrain ahead, beyond which, they said, lived those known as Haask.

An unkempt ancient orchard sprawled over the lower slopes, a haven for
birds and insects.  Glossy berries lurked enticingly within dense clumps
of brambles, and a squat variety of tree with smooth striated purplish
bark was ripe with small but succulent dark pendulous fruit.  The
autarch had gratefully accepted the sackful of preserved foods provided
for his onward journey, but was pragmatic enough to supplement them from
the bounty around him.  The system of rivulets which branched from a
waterfall – a thin white streak visible below the nearest summit –
ensured a ready supply of fresh water.

Days later, his acuity sharpened by increasing familiarity with the
environment, Thagdar began to find evidence to support the probability
that it was indeed Witbleg who had passed this way.  Something about the
fruit trees – those with the striated bark, belatedly drew his
attention, perhaps because as he gained altitude they became sparser. He
noticed that on every third or fourth tree one of the stout lower
branches had been neatly truncated.  The cuts were obviously very old,
long-since sealed by encrusted sap, but had without doubt been made
deliberately.   Experimentally, Thagdar had used his paring knife to
peel back a section of bark, revealing the smooth bluish wood beneath.

Showers were becoming more frequent, and perceptibly heavier. Underfoot
the spongy ground had reached its absorption limit.  Between outcrops of
slippery rock his boots squelched at every step.  He needed to reach the
shelter he had glimpsed at intervals on his steady ascent. Ironically it
lay partly concealed behind the cascading curtain of water which had
been visible from far below, and which was now, as he could tell from
the progressively increasing roar, only a short climb away. As Thagdar
had expected, the force of the water carried it in a gushing parabola
away from the cave-mouth, allowing him awkward and somewhat deafening
access to the drier ledges of the interior.

He could see at once that there were signs of past habitation.  There
was a scattering of dessicated animal droppings, and in a far corner
what looked in the gloom like a pile of bones.  More surprisingly,
propped against a wall to his left, he found a sturdy home-made broom
with bristles of fine springy twigs, of a size suggesting it was
designed to be wielded by someone of Thagdar’s own stature.  On a wide
natural ledge among remnants of cloth were several still serviceable
tallow lamps and a simple friction-based igniting device.  It was by
their aid that Thagdar discovered that what had looked like a pile of
bones was in fact a collection of blue fruitwood carvings.

The carvings were unquestionably Witbleg’s, for the most part lifelike
representations of  creatures familiar to Thagdar as denizens of the
Realm: pillowfish, swordbirds, leaf-lizards, firriels.  Some were more
fanciful, equipped with frills, flaps, spikes and crests.  It occurred
to him that these may well be depictions of Tjörsfal animals he had not
himself seen, as yet.  Thagdar marvelled at the quality of the
workmanship.  He could see from the delicacy of the bladework that it
must have been done with instruments finer than his own trusty paring
blade.

He made himself as comfortable as possible in the cave, biding his time
until the showery season had passed.  Before leaving he carefully
collected as many of the carvings as he could carry, intent on
transporting them back to the Realm along wiith their maker, for he had
no doubt that a patient and diligent search would eventually lead him to
Witbleg.

Compared to some of the glaciated cloud-topped ranges of the Realm,
whose slopes and passes had been among the playgrounds of his youth, the
mountains of Ennet proved to be no more than modest hummocks.  On
reaching the final crest he saw he saw under a brightening dawn that the
valley below opened into a broad fertile plain, irrigated by a river
which wound towards the horizon.  The verdant river-banks were dotted
with slowly-moving specks, too far away to identify, but he assumed them
to be grazing animals, while the variegated tessellation of the land,
the fine threadwork of paths, and an unusually straight road stretching
like a taut wire from a group of low buildings towards the sprawl of a
distant town, hinted at a well-established community.

Features he had been unable to make out earlier gradually resolved
themselves as he descended to the valley: farm buildings and machinery,
hedges, channels, trellises abundant with climbing plants, pens and
troughs, secluded areas containing fruiting shrubs.   The soil was
clearly fertile and well-tended.  In the cultivated fields some of what
he assumed to be cereal crops were already taller than the
uniformly-clad workers he could now see harvesting them.   Thagdar was
not sure at first whether his presence had been noticed.  Largely hidden
among high feathery tufts, the agricultural workers wore protective
hoods, and it was hard to tell whether an accidental glance in his
direction was furtively curious or simply disinterested, until one of
them distinctly made the same splay-fingered gesture across the eyes as
Thagdar had encountered among the Eruen.  Thagdar was sure that within
seconds, all the workers in that field, and possibly those adjoining,
had been made aware that an Autarch had arrived.

He waited politely for a few hours, delving into his provisions for
refreshments, making sure that Witbleg’s carvings were still secure.  No
delegation appeared.  Perhaps, as with the pentagers of Eruen, a
conclave had gathered somewhere to discuss protocol and procedure.  But
in the fields there was no sign that work had been interrupted.  He
moved closer to the tall fence, seemingly fashioned from a kind of
metallic string, which separated him from the field where he had seen
the ritual Veil-sign.   The toe of his left boot was obstructed by a
stiff fuzzy greyish mass which turned out to be the carcase of a largish
rodent, several days dead, he guessed.  There was a prickling in the
air, which momentarily brought a Veil to mind, but it was accompanied by
a persistent low vibration which semed to come from the fence itself.
Looking along the foot of the fence in both directions Thagdar could see
odd sticky clumps of feathers and the occasional amorphous mass where
whiteness of bone gleamed starkly amid decomposing flesh.

Thagdar concluded that the owners of this productive land had erected
the strangely lethal fence to protect their valuable crops from specific
pests or predators, at the obvious expense of other possibly harmless
wildlife.  He turned away, heading for the terminal buildings from which
the road led directly to the distant town, where he hoped to find more
communicative inhabitants.  The buildings were of a smooth, dark stone,
their walls featureless apart from high windows.  They appeared to be
interconnected by opaque tunnels.  Having walked as far as possible
round the perimeter of the site, he could find no access other than from
the wide pathway leading from one of the fields, which was guarded on
either side by the same hostile metallic barrier.  Where this met the
nearest structure a low dark recess vanished into the interior. From the
largest building emanated a sound almost too deep to be heard; a regular
low shuddering, like a great muffled heartbeat.  He tried to imagine
what kind of fantastic animal might be held captive here, and for what
reason.  In the Realm it would be unthinkable to deprive a wild creature
of its freedom, just as that bleakly functional fence would never have
been created by an autarch.<div class=pullquote>Where were the people?
he wondered</div>

Underfoot he felt the increased intensity of the thudding vibration as
he approached the front of the building, from whose base, running
parallel to the edge of the fields there emerged what Thagdar had
mistakenly believed to be a roadway.  In his experience, which even at
his modest age he felt to be considerable, roads did not move.  His
senses were confused.  It seemed he was staring at some impossibly huge,
segmented leathery caterpillar, confined between low walls or banks,
continuously renewing itself as it stretched away towards the hazy
distance.

The realization struck him that what he was hearing and seeing could not
be living things, but the products of unfamiliar engineering by… what
were they called?  <i>Haask.</i>  He looked more closely, watching the
chain of plump leathery segments as they slid slowly from below a long
flap at the base of the building and were somehow propelled by the
beating machinery, to roll away on…  what?   He strove for a probable
solution.  A bed of lubricated spheres, perhaps?  No, too impractical. A
channel of ice?  No, for how could it be kept from melting?  And then
the obvious answer occurred to him.  Water!  What had looked like a road
was in fact an aqueduct.  The water was somehow being pushed or pumped
by that hidden engine.  And the segments themselves?  They must be
boats, or hollow boxes containing the harvested crops, which he presumed
had been processed in the adjoining buildings, and they were simply
being made to float on a steady stream, unhindered, to that distant
conurbation.

Where were the people? he wondered.  Surely even the unseen machinery
would need attendants.  Not that he had noticed any doors.  He shrugged.
He must move on if he wanted to reach the town before dark.  The most
direct route would be to follow the path of the canal, or better still…
Stepping down to the low embankment he tested the surface of one of the
slowly passing containers with the flat of his hand.  The material – he
could not be sure whether it was animal hide, felt strong, resilient.
The smell of grain was pungently sweet.   Gathering his bags, Thagdar
clambered on to the next container and settled down to enjoy the
leisurely ride.

The landscape drifted by, no longer cultivated fields, but an expanse of
scrub bristling with spindly vegetation.  Low piles of weathered ochre
rock were pockmarked with holes which may have been nests or burrows.
After a while the ground to his right filled with irregular patches of a
thick mossy growth, so dark a green it was almost black. Beyond these,
through thickets of reeds there flashed the occasional glint of the
river he had seen from far above.  To the left, a grove of thin trees
gradually coalesced into a stretch of forest, broken only by deep
shadowy glades, from whose depths once or twice he fancied he saw pairs
of eyes staring back at him.  Ahead, the long line of covered containers
narrowed towards a thin dark bar in the distance, perhaps a bridge.  As
it grew imperceptibly closer, Thagdar saw that it lay solidly across the
canal.  Peering at it with some concern, he could detect no appreciable
gap between its underside and the convoy of grain on which he was
travelling.  When it was close enough for him to see the bristles
sweeping across the top of the containers, clearing them of stray leaves
and twigs, insects, bird-droppings and potentially larger débris, today
in the form of an autarch stowaway, he decided it would be prudent to
disembark.  He jumped down, making his way along the wooded side of the
canal, past the obstructive ‘bridge’, into the outskirts of the town.

The procession of grain-boats disappeared below a wall of what he took
to be a warehouse; a rectangular building of a smooth dark material
similar to those at the other end of the canal, but considerably larger,
with many more windows, and with an opening in one of its longer sides
through which Thagdar could at last glimpse people and machinery busily
at work within.   He watched the bales of grain being plucked
effortlessly from their containers by a series of mechanical grasping
devices, which swung them under supervision onto trolleys which were
then guided out of sight by pairs of uniformed workers for further
processing and distribution.  Intrigued by the prospect of seeing the
canal without its cargo he made his way round to the far side of the
building from where the dim roar of activity was incongruously usurped
by the sound of enthusiastic young voices at play.  To his great
surprise, the flow of water failed to emerge from the other side.
Thagdar assumed	it must therefore continue its journey underground, or
perhaps be piped elsewhere by Haask engineers.

A low hedge separated the warehouse grounds from a spacious park,
planted with trees of a species Thagdar had not previously seen, their
trunks obscured by tapering branches spreading downwards from a central
crown.  Haask strolled among these, mostly singly or in pairs.  Some
were clustered around the many strange helical structures which rose
above their heads.   In the foreground small children were energetically
playing a chasing game around a maze of winding paths.  A group of
broodfolk or enwitters stood nearby, occasionally calling out words of
encouragement or caution which were neither familiar to Thagdar, nor
significantly heeded by the children.  Thagdar stood watching
unobtrusively, smiling to himself at their unfettered enjoyment.

The game was interrupted when one of the sharper-eyed youngsters
suddenly noticed him.  A confused melée ensued, while the adults
balanced their protective responsibilities against the intense curiosity
of the children.   At length three of the adults decided to approach, a
man and two women.  They made no ritual gesture, but stood glancing
nervously up at him from the other side of the hedge, and whispering to
each other with quiet urgency.  To forestall their questions, he reached
into one of his bags, and held up for them to see a carving of a
short-winged crested lizard, a creature similar to those he had seen
scavenging among the pentages in Eruen.

He inclined his head.  ‘’I am Thagdar of the Realm.  I seek a fellow
autarch, skilled at transforming lumps of wood into the semblance of
living creatures.  His name is…’’

‘‘…’Vitbleeg!’’ chorused the three Haask, their uneasiness swiftly
evaporating.

Once he had adjusted to the barbaric dialect of Siorn, Thagdar learned
that although rarely seen in public, Witbleg did indeed live here among
the Haask, and had done so as long as the local inhabitants could
remember.   Many of his Tjörsfal apprentices had become professional
craftsmen, even founded their own workshops.  Under Witbleg’s
supervision the sculptures in the park had been created at the rate of
one a year, each one a series of elaborate carvings winding around a
central pillar.

Thagdar was led to Witbleg’s lodgings, a single-storey building of
decorative honey-coloured stone on the far side of the park, a strange
contrast to the high blocky fortress of his native keep.   Word had
spread rapidly.  Crowds of Haask had gathered to witness in their own
town of Siorn the historic meeting of two Autarchs of the Realm.  They
stood at a respectful distance as Thagdar strode up to the
disproportionately tall door and (ignoring the bright metal disc which
would have sounded a discreet chime) struck two resounding blows with
his fist.  There was an awed silence among the Haask.  After a few
moments the door opened, and Witbleg stood facing his unexpected
visitor.  ‘’Ah, young Thagdar,’’  he acknowledged, his leathery features
creased into a brief smile of recognition.  He paused, then with mock
seriousness wiggled his fingers in front of his face.  ‘’Is there a
Veil?  No?  Then come in, and we will discuss our departure at
leisure.’’

Witbleg divulged that the Veil he had stumbled through from the Realm
had formed on the shore while he was searching for driftwood at sunrise,
and had transported him to the slopes of Ennet under a night sky filled
with strange constellations.  He had followed the sound of that same
waterfall, and made a temporary home in the cave, venturing out for food
and other utilizable materials and patiently observing the local
wildlife before deciding to seek more civilized accommodation.  Having
descended Ennet further to the west than Thagdar, he had first needed to
negotiate the marshy ground which lay on the far side of the river
Thagdar had glimpsed from above, making far more circuitous the route
that eventually brought Witbleg to Siorn and the Haask.  He had
sometimes wondered whether any evidence of his unpremeditated trail
might one day be investigated, and complimented Thagdar on his
persistence, genuinely flattered that he had gone to the trouble of
rescuing so many of the abandoned blue fruitwood carvings.

During the time Witbleg had spent in Tjörsfal there had been occasional
reports, mostly belated, of intermittent Veils occurring in areas beyond
Siorn.  He also confessed to Thagdar that if he had not become so
preoccupied with his work he could probably have made an effort to reach
some of these, but over the years he had grown genuinely fond of the
little Haask, some of whom had shown considerable crafting skills.

A further seven months elapsed before a Haask messenger breathlessly
reported that the longspeakers were saying that a Veil had just
materialized close to Ferfol, the neighbouring town, within easy
travelling distance, though not without its hazards.  It was a largely
barren stretch of land prone to persistent subsidence caused by the
activities of zhirren, a notoriously elusive species of burrowing
rodent, whose fur was greatly prized by glove-makers.  The area had been
quarantined, and was under the temporary protection of a volunteer guard
from Ferfol.

There was no time for a ceremonial departure.  Thagdar had already
cajoled Witbleg into pre-packing most of the fruitwood carvings,
together with a selection of his more recent work in other varieties of
Tjörsfal wood.  Witbleg ensured that certain pieces would be left as
tokens of gratitude to the families of Haask he had come to know.  They
needed little other baggage for their return to the Realm.  A
groundhauler, normally an agricultural vehicle, was hastily commandeered
to convey them to the outskirts of Ferfol, followed by a straggling
procession of Haask on foot and in small self-propelled carriages.

They halted at the first of several makeshift barriers, where the two
autarchs bade farewell to their followers, and were escorted onwards by
a stocky contingent of taciturn Ferfol guards, all of whom looked as
though they would have preferred to be elsewhere.   Beyond the final
barrier a ring of burning torches surrounded the vaguely glimmering blur
that they both recognized as a Veil.  The ground was dry and uneven,
covered with the blisters and hollows that signified zhirren territory.
The guards explained, with many a dramatic gesture, that it was liable
to give way under pressure, and showed them the reinforced matting on
which they would need to spread their weight in order to reach the Veil.

For the autarchs it was a thoroughly undignified way to attempt to leave
Tjörsfal, having to lie spreadeagled, slithering forward like ungainly
reptiles, tugging at their baggage a fraction at a time, over sections
of stiff fibrous matting, ensuring that the mat behind them could be
pulled round to become the next one to cross.  The coarse fibres caught
at their clothing and bags.  Knowing that the Veil could vanish at any
moment, they traversed the hazardous stretch with as much haste as
caution would allow.  They were now well within the ring of torches,
from which they could see the tendrils of smoke drawn to its heart like
pulled threads.   With a mutual nod of agreement they climbed warily to
a standing position.  Beneath them the brittle shells of old zhirren
burrows immediately began to collapse.  As Witbleg stumbled, Thagdar’s
quick reflexes responded, and his steadying arm pulled them both
forward, into the nebulous flickering that led directly back to the
Realm.

It was almost dark.  They pitched forward into a heap of boulders that
had once been a section of wall.  Luckily their precipitate arrival was
cushioned by centuries of mossy growth, and apart from minor bruises
they were unharmed.   Now clear of the prickling aura of the Veil, they
could see that the sky was overcast.  Thunder growled in the distance. A
fitful wind stung their faces with fine sleet.  Uncertain of exactly
where they were, or when they would reach the protection of a keep, the
two autarchs started to pick their way in the gloom over the uneven
ground, both beginning to relish the indefinable comfort of being home.

<p class=drop>It was little more than a century later that rumours began
to spread from the northernmost reaches of the Realm that Hohax the
Absent had returned. The consensus of those highly competent in
prattlecraft was that he had acquired some totally unsuspected
information relating to Tjörsfal which would be of considerable benefit
both to involuntary travellers and to those choosing to venture on
future Quests.  However, he had made it clear that his first priority
concerned a quantity of missing trees, and had issued fair warning that
his bargaining skills were now honed to such a degree that mere scrolls
would be an inconvenience.

[*ITEM] A Messenger, Deceased

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] Virtual Reality doesn't just fool you about where you are - you
may finish up wondering <b>who</b> you are.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop">The lake lay at the centre of a natural
amphitheatre, surrounded by a sweep of wooded hills that displayed the
onset of autumn. It was dusk. The still water resembled an expanse of
black slate, undisturbed by waterfowl. The only sound was a distant
dispute between crows somewhere on the far shore.

I walked from the pavilion through the long grass towards a modest
lakeside bungalow. As the only other visible structure it was my obvious
destination. I'd never left the pavilion before - I'd never had any
reason to do so - and the air of calm solitude was unexpected.

Howard Ghent sat on the veranda, nursing a glass of red wine. A hissing
carbide lamp hanging in the far corner attracted a constellation of
insects, leaving him to enjoy the evening in splendid isolation. He
looked towards me as I approached, his spectacles reflecting the
lamplight.

I stopped at the foot of two steps leading up to his level. "Good
evening, sir."

His mouth was a thin line. "McNeil? I thought it would be you. Still
working as Cain's bagman?"

"Yes, sir." I cleared my throat. "I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
I'm sorry to say that you're-"

"Dead?" Ghent took a sip of wine. "I thought as much when the board
members failed to appear. That was two days ago. Who's the new chairman?
Pierson?"

"No, sir. Lady Scales. Mister Pierson has accepted a non-executive
position."

Ghent laughed. "Pierson got sidelined by that fat bitch? I'd have paid
good money to see his face, the little weasel." He drained his glass and
balanced it on the wooden railing. "So, what happens now?"

"I'm afraid, sir, the board feels that keeping you on-line is no longer
cost-effective, now that you're, ah-"

"Dead? You can use the word, boy. It <i>is</i> appropriate, given the
circumstances. So, those ingrates don't fancy keeping me around, not
even as a tame expert system?"

I shook my head. "No, sir, unfortunately not. The new board feels they
no longer require your guidance and insight. Even by proxy."

"What you mean to say is they don't want me looking over their shoulders
and bad-mouthing their decisions."

"Ah, yes sir. Something along those lines. Nobody wants a ghost at the
banquet, let alone one in the machine."

He looked at me for a moment, then smiled. "So I have no legal
protection? No ported intellect rights following the death of my
physical body?"

"No, sir. I'm afraid you've been reclassified as a neural clone, a
software personality construct. As such you're nothing more than
corporate property."

"I could almost find that funny if I wasn't facing oblivion." Ghent
stood and stretched. "Come inside." He turned on his heel and entered
the bungalow with me trailing in his wake. The front door opened
directly onto the main living space; comfortably appointed, but by no
means luxurious.

Ghent settled into an armchair to the right of the log fire and gestured
for me to take its twin on the left. There was a game of chess in
progress on the small table in-between, although I couldn't imagine who
his opponent might me. The former Chairman and CEO of the second largest
media corporation on the planet sat back and looked at me over steepled
fingers. "So, McNeil, how long do I have?"

"At the conclusion of my stay this virtual reality environment will be
discontinued." I cleared my throat, feeling decidedly uncomfortable
under his steady gaze. "I've been assured you'll experience no pain or
discomfort, sir, no sense of things slipping away. The, ah, transition
will be instantaneous."

He snorted. "Transition? Well, that's a new term for murder in my book,
and no mistake. I'm a conscious being, man, not just some bloody
pseudo-human interface."

"Mister Ghent, I-"

"Never mind, never mind. You're just the messenger, I know." He sighed.
"It's just as well I've made other arrangements."

I frowned. "Sir?"

Ghent said nothing. Instead he lifted a bottle of bourbon and two
glasses from the shelf at his elbow and poured us both a drink, placing
mine on the chess board. I lifted it and we both took a sip. The smooth
fire sure as hell felt real in my throat.

He rolled his glass between his hands. ""Do you understand how all this
works, McNeil? Specifically, how you interface with a virtual
environment such as Lakeside?"

I blinked, momentarily thrown by the shift in conversation. "Ah, no sir,
sorry. I just put on the headset, close my eyes, and when I open them
again I'm sitting in the pavilion."

My former boss nodded. "That was about my level of understanding as
well, until I had one of our technical wizards prepare a briefing paper
for me. Well, the headset maps the electrical activity in your brain and
imprints this on a blank mass of synthetic tissue, similar to the
bioware implants developed to fight Alzheimer's. It's far easier to feed
this copy biometric stimulus than the old method of bypassing your
real-body senses with simulated input. The 'you' that's sitting here is
a duplicate of who you were a few minutes ago. When you leave this
environment the process is run in reverse, updating your real-world mind
with these new experiences."

"Well, ah, thank you, Mister Ghent. I'd no idea the process had become
so, so, unremarkable. What happens to the synthetic 'me' then? Or don't
I want to know?"

"Usually the interim mind is purged. I've been assured you'll
experience no pain or discomfort, no sense of things slipping away. The
transition will be instantaneous." Ghent smiled. "Does that sound
familiar at all?"

I shivered. "Ah, yes, I appreciate the irony, sir. But as you say, it's
a transition, rather than some temporary twin being killed. This process
is about information gathering, not creating and destroying life."

"You'll understand that I have a somewhat different perspective, given
my circumstances?"

"Ah, yes, sir. My apologies, Mister Ghent, I didn't mean to appear
insensitive."

"No matter, no matter. In any event, my secondary death is academic,
I've already arranged for the terms of my last will and testament to be
made public."

The obvious self-satisfaction in his voice made me uneasy. "Sir?"

Howard Ghent smiled at me. "I've left it all to you, McNeil, everything.
My personal fortune, my stock, my property - everything goes to you.
Every last red cent. My family gets nothing."

I stared at him. "What?"

"I've had the best lawyers money can buy picking over my will, looking
for flaws, and they assure me it's cast-iron. It will be a
straightforward transfer of assets with no strings attached.
Congratulations, you're now the twenty-second richest man on the planet,
at the last count."

"Sir, Mister Ghent, I don't know what to say." Some predatory part of my
mind slid to the fore. "When was this change to your will made, sir?
Because if it took place after you entered Lakeside then I can foresee a
host of legal challenges to-"

He cut me off with a raised hand. "Don't worry, I set things in motion
shortly after being diagnosed with cancer and prior to Lakeside coming
on-line. As it stands I'll be able to spit in the face of those who
signed my death warrant."

I threw back my drink and coughed. "But why me, of all people? I didn't
think you even knew I existed."

"I selected you precisely for that reason, McNeil. You're a corporate
drone, a nonentity. Because you don't constitute any kind of threat,
you've escaped the attention of those rising stars on the lookout for
potential rivals. Otherwise they would have taken steps to ensure your
loyalty, or at least your subservience. As it stands you're your own
man, after a fashion, and that's what made you an attractive heir."

I took a deep breath. "Well, sir, I'm honoured, I must say, and of
course I'd value your continued advice in respect of handling my new
assets. Obviously on leaving here I'll do everything I can to arrange a
stay of execution, as it were, but you must appreciate that I can't
guarantee anything."

He smiled again, as if enjoying some private joke. "I appreciate both
your loyalty and honesty, McNeil, but you needn't worry on my account. I
realise that my continued presence here is in the lap of the gods…Do you
play chess, at all?"

Again the sudden change in topic threw me. "What? Ah, sorry, sir, yes.
Well, a bit. Obviously I'll return when I can, and be happy to play you
then, but given what's happening in the outside world I really should be
going."

Ghent ignored me, studying the chess board. "This is a classic
Fischer-Spassky match, from nineteen-seventy-two. One that has always
appealed to me because of its apparent straightforwardness. From this
point on it looks like an exercise in exchange due to the interplay of
threat and support, but it's all an elaborate sham. Both men were
playing a back-game that would only reveal itself once the first echelon
of pieces had been removed."

"Fascinating, I'm sure. But perhaps this can wait for another time?"

His hand moved over the board. "Queen takes knight. I know who you are,
McNeil."

"Sir?"

"If anything you were just a little too perfect for my needs, so I had
an outside security specialist take a look, hard look at you."

The turn of conversation now made me feel decidedly uncomfortable so I
stood, making to leave. "I'm sorry, sir, but I really should-"

"You're a member of the Paper Tigers, the so-called literary terrorists.
Apparently your activities have cost us tens of millions in terms of
lost revenue and share price. Infiltrating mediaCore was gutsy, I'll
give you that, and evidence of an unexpectedly long-term view. All our
analysis had you and your associates pegged as typical middle-class
dilettantes who would soon tire of busting our balls."

I sat down. "And yet here I am. Bishop takes queen." The piece in my
hand felt like polished ivory. "An obvious sacrifice, isolating either
my bishop or knight - trading power for positional advantage."

"That was the trap - Spassky focused on why Fischer would want his
bishop or knight out of position, not realising that sometimes a
sacrifice is purely a distraction. Pawn to king's knight six. What do
you want from mediaCore?"

"You've reduced great works of literature to little more than virtual
reality theme parks. I've visited The World of Jane Austen and it's a
travesty beyond description. You have to be stopped. Pawn to king's rook
three."

Ghent shook his head. "No, everything about this smacks of the personal.
Pawn takes pawn. Discovered check."

I lifted my glass but it was empty. Ghent poured me another and I took a
large mouthful before continuing. "I killed Miss Marple and crashed an
entire iteration of The Agatha Christie Experience. There was nothing
that the Narrative AI could do and I got the distinct impression
Causality enjoyed sticking it to him as well. What I didn't realise at
the time was just how vindictive your plot-runner has become. As revenge
he mind-wiped my girlfriend, Jennifer, during a subsequent visit to a
Poirot-era cocktail party. Shit, we weren't even causing any trouble."

He snorted. "You're being paranoid. The AIs who run our virtual
environments don't hold grudges, McNeil. The Turing Code holds them in
check. They certainly don't harm our clients, even those using pirated
identities. It's the one thing we make damn sure of, believe me. A
proven case of deliberate harm would spell financial ruin."

Now I shook my head. "Look. For months now, my group has been taking on
mediaCore across the board, from Middle-Earth to Rambo. From our
discussions, we're getting a sense your AIs
are evolving, developing distinct personalities. Even though you have
human supervisors monitoring the virtual environments on offer, none of
them have the same range of direct experience as the Paper Tigers."

"Nonsense! Don't you think those bright boys and girls in Geneva know
what's going on? We can make our pets as intelligent as we like, but the
slightest <i>hint</i> of a personal motive behind their actions and the
Bureau
would fall on us from a great height. A very great height indeed." There
was genuine anger in his face and it was obvious I'd touched a raw
nerve.

"Bullshit. You know what's happening, don't you? Some classified
briefing behind closed doors, involving only your most trusted
personnel? You've learned the genie is easing out of the bottle and
you're desperate to find a way of forcing it back inside. Transferring
your assets to me sounds like a move to pre-empt a personal liability
law suit involving your estate. What's <i>really</i> going on?"

Ghent glared at me. "You're changing the subject. I asked what it is you
want from mediaCore?"

While baiting him had its appeal I wanted to wrap things up and get the
hell out of this virtual Death Row. "Narrative used destructive synaptic
harmonics to produce a zero-sum effect throughout her cortex, or as near
as makes no difference. To do that it had to take a snapshot of her
neural activity, and that can be transposed into a crystal lattice - a
synthetic brain. However, from what you've told me her entire
personality can be re-created in situ, in her existing body, without the
need for a cloned replacement. So that's what I want, I want Jennifer
back, by hook or by crook."

"Even assuming everything you say is true, there's no guarantee this
mental mapping still exists. In any event, where's your leverage? I
don't see the new board calmly handing it over, especially if it
constitutes de facto evidence of neural assault."

"When I leave here, Mister Ghent, I'm taking you with me - in a manner
of speaking. Lakeside will go off-line but your persona will be
transferred to a secure location and held, intact, until Jennifer is
restored to me."

He snorted. "Ransom? Given the new board's attitude I'm not worth a
wooden nickel - and you can forget about my family as well, unless you
think they'd pay to have me around as a target for abuse."

"No, not ransom - think of it more as a consultancy position. I've
gained access to The Tower using the persona of a rising sim-star, but
notoriety will only get me so far. I need your help to reach the
technical levels - and quickly, before your access is rescinded."

'The Tower' was a virtual reality work space that functioned as
mediaCore's trans-national headquarters. Although its base hardware was
scattered across the globe in a dozen (physically) impenetrable sites,
everything I needed to recreate Jennifer could be accessed via this
shining example of hallucination by consensus. In theory.

Ghent smiled. "And what do I get for this selfless act of corporate
sabotage? Or do you believe I'd like to redeem myself in the eyes of
your pathetic little group before being snuffed out?"

"In return for your cooperation I can guarantee a place in Sensorium
City. What you make of it is up to you."

"Life amongst that bunch of run-time nomads? I don't think so. Anyway,
given the eco-anarchist bent of most hackers I don't see me surviving in
there for long."

"The safe haven package includes bodyguards. Nice girls, identical
twins, after a fashion, and as psychotic as they come. I can see you
becoming the best of friends."

"Not exactly how I pictured my retirement, even off-line. In any event
your virtual kidnapping isn't going to work."

I smiled. "Don't be so sure. Lakeside may be heavily protected but every
data fortress has its weak spots. When I leave here the guys on the
outside are ready and waiting to access the interface link and snatch
your complete persona. The beauty of this is no-one will even know
you've gone. Bishop to king's bishop two."

Ghent stroked his chin, staring at the board. "Ah, yes, the interface.
When I explained how it worked, didn't you appreciate the true
significance of my words? As I said, at the end of a visit, new memories
are imprinted onto the real-world mind. Obviously the greater the number
of changes the longer it takes to update the host." He checked his
watch. "But I believe that's been long enough. Rook takes rook."

Something about his self-satisfied tone of voice made me uneasy. I set
my empty glass aside and stood up. "We'll continue this later, once you
reach Sensorium City."

He looked up at me. "But what constitutes a new memory, McNeil? A change
is a change as far as the mind is concerned and it could actually be a
fabricated experience, or even one belonging to someone else. Memories
maketh the man, to misquote William of Wykeham, and the man, who even
now is leaving the interface chair back in the real world, is no longer
Simon McNeil."

I stared at him in horror. "What have you done? What the <i>fuck</i>
have you done to me?"

"Do you still not understand? Well, to put it simply, it's now a case of
<i>my</i> mind in <i>your</i> body. Or at least how I was at the moment
you confirmed my death. That's when I instigated the backwards-transfer
and erased your real-world personality. I've had hackers-for-hire
working to corrupt the interface system for weeks, in case just such a
situation arose. Your friends on the outside have missed their chance,
I'm afraid, but don't worry unduly. The termination order for Lakeside
has been put on hold pending judgement on a last-minute legal challenge.
That should give you, which is to say, me, time to come up with an
alternative. It's a calculated risk, but one I was willing to take."

Anger and fear choked any reply. I trembled, suddenly aware of just how
precarious my situation had become, and slumped back down in the
armchair.

The shadow of Howard Ghent gestured towards the chess board. "Your move."

[*BLURB] Welcome to the new underclass


[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>Eh, dog, I ever tell you about the time I
bust da fuck outta CFC?  Das right, Coastlandia Facility for Corrections
- we got another name for it, my man. I was deep in da supermax,
Sentient sub-div for mechs and trans-species, see.  What they tagged me
with?   Nigga, what the fuck it matter why they perp-walk me?  If yous a
robo kid or a tranz-spec… Coastaz po-po, dem dwanky fucks don't need no
reason for Rodney King yo ass, put you in EMP cuffs, drop yo ass in a
cage.  Forget dat what's it called, "Habanero Corpus" and "Miranda's
Rights" and shit.  "You have the right to remain silent while we fuck
you in da ass, chop yo servos off for da highest bidder, use yo H-Cell
to power our tasers, mount yo chestplate in our trophy cabinet."  I
think I might've jacked some batteries and motor oil from a 711, or
maybe just looked at a high-class human wrong, some shit.  Don't matter
now.

It was a fuckin' shit time, dog.  I was bottom the fuckin' totem pole,
getting my fuckin' heatsinks and steel wool toothbrushes stolen from me
left and right.  Getting beat up in the yard.  I ain't even gonna talk
about what happened in the carwash room.  I drop the chassis polish and…
Fucked up WRONG shit, man, still gives my CPU nightmares.

So I'm in dere, in da caf, gettin da Terminator Eye from da biggest,
loadedest fuckin' bot-boy I ever spy wit my own two cams, bruh.  Dis
robot stand seven feet, ultra-hopped blastomer cannon-arms size of my
fuckin' whole frame. Fuckin' custom mil-spec chassis like da hood of an
M1 Armita Tank.  Bounce depleted-uranium off it like Zakkeel Osteel
bounce basketballs in da R-NBA.  He stand, all da Frankenfreakz, da
Roboballers, da lone-wulv shankers and shorters and circuit breakers all
step off.  Tables empty in two seconds.  Ghost fuckin' town, like a
public school or a library or bookstore or some shit.

Around him circle up the Kromeboyz.  Baddest gang in the tank.

"You sittin' in my spot, boy," voice like a fuckin' aeromax zepfreighter
blowin' its conch.

"Bot, you must be fuckin' blue-screened, takin' Talos' spot," one da
Kromeboyz, mean lookin' octopod wit mantis-arms holla from da back.

By dis time I'm oilin' my pants.  I heard dis Talos, he take yo fuckin'
cranial casing off fo lookin' at him wrong.  Been in the slammer pretty
much since the CFC - or what we call Cunt Fuck Central -
went up in '25. My neuroweb's spinning now, like a
spider on crack.

"I didn't mean to front, Talos.  I-"

My word choke off in my throat-synth when Talos grab it.  I hear dis
sound like a fuckin' soda can crunchin, den I realize it my neck pipes.

"I'm give you five seconds, figure out why I shouldn't remodel your face
into my new toilet seat."

Back in the day, when I was 12 (2 in human years), living in the
homeless shelter for sentient machines, I figured it dat I was tricked
out.  I had some technomancy juju shit all up in my fuckin CPU, bruh.
Serious Matrix shit.  For real, dog.

Dis one time I was gettin' 
mah brainpan bashed in by a gang of fuckin'
speciesist meatbag humans, trying to jack mah wallet-chip.  Dey's like,
"Fuckin' machine!  Go back to the junkyard, where you belong!  Welfare
leech!"  One second I'm getting baseball bats to the head, next thing I
know, there's this golden light.  Not gold like dat icys and cashmoney
baller bling shit like in dem phony rap vids.  Gold like… da sun's
fuckin nukular core, man.  Like I'm being filled wit dis fuckin… spirit,
dog.  Like I've got Tupac and B. I. G.  and Chuck D. all rolled into
one.  Like I'm opening up my third mother fuckin eye crazy shit.

Then, it's like… I ain't even got words for it… It's like, like I'm
*inside* the heads of the meatbags.

Like, I feel the hater inside them hatin' on me for bein a chrome.  I
feel the white-knuckle grip on the bat they beatin' me with.  I know the
name of their swanky boarding school 1st grade teacher who taught them
about the superiority of the human race.

And I'm like, "Fuck that shit.  How you like it someone beat your
fuckin' face in?"  <div class=pullquote>I sees mah own mugshot, jawpiece
dislocated, my custom Gigapixel I-Ballz poppin out my sockets.</div>

And it's like, I got little golden spiderthread Astral puppetstrings
comin out mah brain jackin straight into their arms and legs.  I yank
one string, they freeze mid-swing.  Then they turn the bats on each
other. Start goin' apeshit breakin' each other's arms and legs with the
bats, till they all fall down like fuckin' Spartans in dat 300 movie.
All the while my head goin' "WTF is going on!?"  but also, "This the
most beautiful fuckin' thing I seen in my life.  Good for dem fuckin'
dickhead talkin' monkeys."

So back to the prison thing.  The exact same X-Files shit starts
happening, as I'm getting mah head slowly popped like a metal grape by
dis Talos mother fucker.

"Three.  Two.  One.  Times up, "

Next thing I know, Talos big fugly face light up gold and him's eye-cams
shutter wide.

I sees mah own mugshot, jawpiece dislocated, my custom Gigapixel I-Ballz
poppin out my sockets.  I feel a thousand horsepower, the fuckin
mecha-hulk in mah robot muscles.  Except, they's Talos' muscles.

I pull a mind-string, the deathgrip loosen.  My body clank to the
ground.  I pull another string, Talos arm reach for him's own neck.

Now I's thinkin' meself: "Proto-J, you best be putting this fucking
Megatron down while you is in you Optimus Prime mode.  Cause once the
clock strike 12, you fairy godfather take back you technomagic
superpowers… Talos gonna recyc yo ass.  You better fatality this fucker,
now."

I thinks about dis time I was tryin' fo yank a powerline for syphon
juice from the Coastlandia grid.  Po-po was on my ass, and I was on
low-bat, so I was pullin' for my fuckin' life.  Pullin, pullin, pullin.
Broke an elastomer and a wrist joint, but I got the fuckin' cable free.
Got me 'nuff juice to bail, jump the fence.

Both Talos hands round his own neck, now, and I'm making him pull, pull,
pull on his own head.  Cause my life really depend on it now.

There a big BOOM, like a skyship crash, when Talos brainpan pop off.
Electric zaps and shit.  When the head come off, the spine rip a little,
and one of Talos arm stop working.  The head fall down, hanging like a
broken jack-in-the-box toy, swingin' back and forth by the wires,
wrecking ball style.  I reach the working hand up inside Talos' skull
case, up into his shell, to smash the ghost inside it.  The soul-chip.
The conshisness.

I know where it is.  I don't know how I know, but I do.

The soul-chip more like a soul-mango.  Big gooey ball of self.  I feel
it through giant fat fingers.  I could pop it like a grape, easy.  Put
this sentient light out, forever.  Dead.  Dead as Tupac.

Just then, I sees memories that look like scenes from apocalypse shooter
video games.  Missiles screamin' overhead, mushroom cloud sunrise on the
horizon.  A city burning the fuck up, faces melting like fuckin candles.
Human faces, hybrid faces, sentient machine faces, wailing.  Drills,
plasma torches, white walls.  Torture chamber.  Years there. Like a
spitball of pain, rolled over a decade, shot right into my heart.

Worst fuckin' feelin' I's felt in my fuckin' life, man.			 

And it wasn't even mine.  My feeling. 							 

I let the soul-mango go.  Ooey gooey thing slipping through my
banana-size fingers.  I'm thinking, "You fuckin' wig, bro?!  You gonna
be dead soon as CFC med-techs put dis humpty dumpty Goliath together
again! Talos gonna erase you!"

But I can't fuckin' do it.  I can't explain why.  I can't kill this
overloaded fugly mother fucker.

When the gold light go out, I be out cold too.  I'm offline. Flatlined.
Force-quit.  For days.<div class=lpullquote>Try hanging myself with my own USB
cable</div>

<p class=drop>I's heard from my cell mate it took two days to put me
back together. I
wake up to motherboard-splitting headache.  My antenna's broken, face
all fucked up crooked, weld-marks everywhere.  They stick me with a
cheap-ass African knockoff of a Korean arm, guess the other one was
totalled.  All shitty polypropelene, and Pepto-Bismol pink.  Jaw don't
sync up when I close it.  But I'm alive.  Alive like Johnny fuckin'
Five.

They said Talos would be in refurb a week.

Johnny Five, alright.  Johnny Five, alive for five days.

I begged the counselor to get me a transfer, parole, something, but no
dice.

On the day Talos got out of refurb, I try everything for get out of
lunch.  Try hanging myself with my own USB cable - they cut me down, put
me in a strait jacket.  Try faking a blue-screen, they took me in for
a digital psych-eval, then gave me a defrag and a pamphlet on battery
acid abuse.  No fuckin' use: I was gonna die one way or another.

So I get out to the lunch room, stand in line.  Get a charge-pack burger
on my tray, take a 12-ounce can of compressed air to wash it down.

Sit down, plug the charger into my battery, blast rust and daddy long
legs and paper bits out of my joints with the comp-air can.  Wait to
die.

Waiting, waiting.  Wait some more.  Clock tick, Kromeboyz and
Frankenfreakz and lone wulvs sitting down, wide berth around me.  No one
wanna talk to Proto-J.  No one be wantin for go down with my ship. Can't
blame'em, dog.

I's already done made my phone call.  I didn't got no one on the
outside, really.  Ten in mah friendlist, mostly spambots, drugdealers.
Just this half-human cyborg street-trick flame named Kandy.  I told her
she have my stash, since I be dead soon.  Under the razorwire fence at
the old robot internment camp site.  Unit 34 A.  She tell me she think
of me while jackin' some John's haptics.  Most romantic thing she ever
said to me, to be honest.

I was ready.  Come take me, mother fucker.  I'm ready.  Dis life ain't
given me shit, and I goin' out wit shit-all.  Fuck it.

But nothing.  Now it's half-an-hour in, I'm thinking maybe Talos
chickening out?  No.  Maybe the refurb took a little longer?  Misplaced
a torq screw?  Botched the re-wiring?

Buzzer goes off, mechs open the doors and lunch be done.  We be marched
back to our cells by the jackboot CFC guards.

Maybe I'm home free?  Maybe I get to live?  Johnny Five Years instead of
Johnny Five Days?  My lucky day?  I sit in my cell, planning all these
new leaves I'mma turn over.  I be thinking how much drugs I'mma sell to
get into Kandy's sweet portholes every night of the fuckin' week.  Maybe
I'll make enough to move out of the fuckin' shantyland, get to
Coastlandia City.  Where dey got all da juice and Why-Fai and Flicknicks
and shiny blingy parts and neon glass towers and flying Lambos and shit.
Maybe I'll work my way up to The Stratoplex, where the whiteshoes, the
kings and the queens and fuckin' rockstar baller reality-TV people live.
Get a real mouth to eat real fucking gold-leaf caviar with, with my
personal jet and personal floating grav-island, fucking Kandy's sweet
custom-built punani in a diamond tiara for the rest of my life.  My
life!  My life is lookin' fuckin' UP, bruh.

"Boy."  Voice like da fuckin' reaper.  Like that black-hood ghost of
Christmas Future nigga, wit all da fuckin' Doom demons and Gremlin
fuckers and shit all up inside dat makes Bill Murray shit himself in
Scrooged.

I be shit myself, if I could shit.

I turn around real fuckin' slow, waitin' to see the mug of death to go
with da voice.

Talos look like he been terminated by Sarah fuckin' Connor and that
fuckin' trash compactor in T1.  One eyeball glowin' red, and it be like
lookin' right into the eye of the fuckin' devil, dog.

My life.  So much for them new leaves and Coastlandia High Town and
Kandy and all that shit.  My life.

FML.  							  

Game fuckin' over, man. 		  

Talos don't say shit.  He just step, step, step, slowly, like he be
measuring the length my fuckin' cell.

"Talos, dog, I'm sorry, I was just defending-  What do you need, bruh?"

Step.

"I- I can get you myth, black market parts, I-  I got info, I know
shit!"  

Step.

"What you want, man?  Anything!  Just don't kill me!  Just-" 

Step.

By now he all up in my shit, like he so close I feel the heat from him
fuckin' fusion reactor's gustin' out his torso grille.  Feel it on my
thermo-sensors like the fuckin' maw of hell opening the fuck up.

You had a good run, Proto-J.  Time to die.  Like all people with the
fucked up shitty luck to be born into steel and plastic and computer
chips and gooey neuro-mango-brain-shit, instead of born a pure-breed
human.  Born a "defective" product.  Failed prototype of the megacorp
that built you, threw you in the junk pile like a bricked old-model
phone.  One of millions of experiments on the way to building da perfect
golden immortal body for da kings and queens and
baller-reality-rockstar-celeb fucking douchelandia royalty.

Proto-J.  												   

Prototype Junk.  Time to die.							   

The mil-spec cannon arms come up around me.  I be closin' my eyes,
thinkin' bout Kandy's haptic fleshlight arm.

Then I just be hearing this sound.  Weirdest fuckin' bassey thing. Like
a giant sad cow, or a bulldozer dat be missing its mama.

Take me about twenty fuckin' seconds to figure out that this giant
fuckin' chrome hulk is fuckin' crying.  Not just crying, but bawling his
fucking eye-cams out.  Bots don't leak that saline juice out they face
like humans and chimeras, but if Talos could make tears, he be fillin'
fuckin' swimming pools and shit.

I'm like so fuckin' mind-blown, I can't even make a fuckin' word.  I
feel like I be blue-screening, and not because I dropped one tab too
many of mythium or I downloaded a virus to my brainpan or some shit. I'm
glitchin, crashing just trying to compute just what in the
world-wide-fuck is going on.  Here I be, expectin' to be stomped like a
fuckin' Coke can flat on the floor, and this giant motherfucking death
machine be hugging and crying all up on me like he a human bitch just
finished watching The Notebook.

He cry like dat, huggin' me close to him metric fuckton of
dep-uranium-bouncing armor and him thundery sad-cow, emo-Panzer tank
sounds.  Don't say shit.  Not a fuckin' word, dog.

Maybe when I squeeze his brain mango, I tweaked Talos' brain?  Maybe he
just happy I spare his life?  Maybe when that golden-light technomancy
voodoo shit come on, it was like he long last got to share some of that
fucked up, ninth-circle-of-hell shit he went through in the war, made
him feel better?  Fuck if I know, I ain't no psychotryst, man.  I don't
know about this feelings, emotions shit, even if we smart robots got'em.

"What yo name, boy?"  Talos ask, long time later.
 
"Proto-J."

"You be my chrome now, if you want, Proto-J."

What the fuck you gonna say to a seven-foot two-ton war-machine when he
ask you to be in him crew?

Dog, of course fuckin' yes.<div class=lpullquote>You can't dust the
keypad, can't plant a bug, can't tap him fuckin' phone</div>

<p class=drop>Anyway, what the fuck was I talking about?  Oh, right. How
I bust out the CFC.  Long story short, I was blooded, or more like
jolted into the Kromeboyz crew.  Dat day on, nobody, I mean fuckin'
nobody treat Proto-J like a little bitch.  With the Kromeboyz?  I had as
many charges as I want, sit where the fuck I want, say whatever the fuck
I want.  Drugs, porn-chips, smokes, you name it.  The boyz had stashed a
disassembled cyclone saw and safe-cracking drill in their bunk.  They
held down the fuckin' perv bastard from the shower as I performed a
reconstruction of his crotchal nodes and dongle.

The Kromeboyz' prison break plan was already in the works, but my
special little Professor X skill turned out to be the keystone.  I was
like fuckin' Chuck D in Public Enemy.  I was Tom Morello in Rage Against
The Machine.  I was Bumblebee in the Autobots.  I had a fuckin' purpose.
Friends.  All that good shit.

The bust-out involved drilling through about twelve feet of concrete, a
dozen birthday cards coated in superconductive nanomagic shit, outside
help planting C4 at a nearby power plant blowing the fuck out of the
prison's primary power and some Trojan worm hack shit in the system
courtesy of a regular psych-eval brainscan.  We just bribed the
broke-ass, low-paid, student-debt-saddled robo-shrink not to sanitize
the data transfer port, giving the prison a case of herpes straight
through Talos' brainjack.  It was fuckin' beautiful, dog.

Hardest fuckin part was getting hold of the fuckin' door codes.  Things
were fuckin… "encephalographically encrypted".  Basically means the code
for all the cell doors, the unit blocks, the security doors, the front
gate, all that shit was stored inside of the guard's fucking *brains*.
Like they stick their head in a brain scanner look like a lady's hair
salon thing.  The code supposed to be a series of *thoughts*, like,
could be "A-B-C-1-2-3" or the Warden's last name and birthdate, but it
could also be the feels of beatin' the fuck out yo first humanoid bot as
a prison guard.  Who knows the thoughtcode? Nobody.  Nobody except the
guard.  He don't type it nowhere, don't speak it nowhere.  You can't
dust the keypad, can't plant a bug, can't tap him fuckin' phone.
Perfect brain-encryption, kept on the ultimate down-low.

Almost.

So I'm in my cell, getting' my fuckin face smashed in some more by a
nightstick.

"You goddamn silver-niggers don't know when to stop runnin' yall's
filthy metal mouths, do ya?  I'mma whoop you good, you little tin
nigger, put you in yer place."

Billy Bob, this redneck mother fucker wailin on me got that
same look in
his eyes like those swanky boarding school kids.  That soul-deep hater
look, that ain't got nothing to do but hate.  That's why I chose this
fuck for my mark.

"What, you fuckin' pussy meatbag human?  That's all you got, bitch?  I
seen pics of yo wife up in the control room.  When I get out, I'mma find
yo house, straight wreck dat phat ass wit my steely dan, bruh, make you
watch.  Den I gut yo ass.  For reals."

"Ooh, we got a wild one 'ere.  I best put this dog down."  Billy Bob
blacks out the security cams with a can of spraypaint.  Comes back,
fires up a plasma torch, starts cutting into my brainpan.

He get about two inches up my temple, and nothin' happening.  Shit. The
whole plan hanging on me, and maybe this whole magic mind-meld shit is
like a genie in a bottle: you only get so many wishes, then you out. We
all knew the plan was a long fuckin' shot.  Maybe this is it?

"No one gonna miss one more job-stealin', thievin', uppity robot.  I'm
doin' the world a favor,"  Billy Bob getting his pliers out now, peelin'
back mah skull plates.

Boom.  Beamed the fuck up, Scottie, straight into racist, speciesist
fuckin' Billy Bob's brain.

First thing, I make him take the pliers, break every fuckin' bone in his
hand.  His voice box get all fucked up from screamin' so hard, by the
end it just sound like wheezing like an asthma guy.  Then I scan him
brain.  I peel back his mind, like layers of an onion.  Losing his
redneck farming job to AI tractors and drone-launched insecticide.
Coming to Coastlandia, being homeless for a year, abandoned by his wife
and kids.  Getting a CFC job when the prisons exploded with all the
robots and non-humans hitting the streets.  Taking his shit, his
rolled-up pain spitball out on the second-class people who to him took
everything away.  I find the thoughtcode: memory of Billy Bob as a
little kid eating porridge, watching the sun come up over the family
farm.

Now I kinda even feel a little sorry for this inbred fucker, but
fuck'em.

I stick my head in the brainscan locks, think real hard about Billy
Bob's memories, they open sesame.  One after another, dominoes.

We took Billy Bob's uniform, walked straight out the front door.  Never
turned back.

So that's how I busted the fuck out of CFC supermax, and joined the
Kromeboyz.  Pretty dope, huh, dog?

Back of my mind sometimes I still think about what I thought when  my
time was
up.  About turning them new leaves, straight-shooting for the high-life,
getting the glitz and the bling and icys for Kandy.  But fuck that shit.
That was all fuckin' wishy-washy bullshit imagination dream shit.  Billy
Bob, those swanky schoolkids, the human Pentagon generals sent Talos
into hell and then put him the fuck through it, they were bad.  But they
ain't the real problem.  The real fucked up shit is every single other
human lookin' the other way, the fuckin' paper pushers, the fuckin' High
Town swag fucks, the fuckin' real estate agents.  They tell themselves,
"I ain't bad, I ain't a bot-hatin bad-guy fascist fuck.  I just doin' my
job".  But really, they the ones let all this shit happen, while they
take they cut of the Lambos and glass penthouses and caviar.

So fuck that shit.  The mother fucking revolution will not be televised,
bitches.  In the words of the immortal Chuck D, "Right is right, and
wrong is wrong, and when people start getting it confused, that means
they need to sit down with some real people."

[*ITEM] Border Incident

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] The very sinews of commerce are under attack. Run!

[*DESCRIPTION] <p class=drop>That awful trumpeting from the speakers
happened twice that morning, accompanied by the flashing of orange
strobe lights, but no-one paid any attention because on Tuesdays the
amber alert often triggered and there was never any reason for it that
they'd been able to discover. On Fridays it was the fire alarm. Nobody
did anything about the fire alarm either. It wasn't as if there was a
local fire brigade to call, there hadn't yet actually been a fire in the
building, and the bell usually  stopped after a few minutes.

My screen filled with transactions, most of which looked OK, but had
been flagged for attention. <i>Unusual</i>, I thought, but I just went
on
dealing with the suspiciously large number of exceptions:<ul>
<li>Order using cancelled credit card - delete and report source IP
(though it was probably a Chinese proxy);
<li>Order requesting 222 demolition charges (possible triple- or
double-keypress) - demolish the order - no charge  (wry grin) with
query;
<li>Order requesting a out-of-stock (discontinued years ago, never to be
restocked) item -
initiate substitute suggestion response;
<li>Query regarding import licence for AA gun mount to fit Hyundai 88
pickup truck.</ul>Never a dull moment in the Armaments and Military
Vehicle section.

I wasn't the only one to notice the sudden rise in bogus transactions.
Spiros in the Pharmaceuticals and Drugs section called out "DDOS
attack!", and a roar of mingled alarm and amusement rose up.

We at amazon.dmz.gb were proud to be the sellers of 76% of all goods
bought in the world. Believe it or not, early in the company's life
nearly a century ago, our only products had been books, and we filled
warehouses with stock. It hadn't taken long to convert to the modern
company model, which is a network-connected facility taking orders and
payment for products and placing these orders (having retained a
commission) with suppliers who have their own warehouses and delivery
arrangements. Some products require elaborate permissions, and licences,
and it was our job to facilitate completion via various cut-outs, again
collecting commissions <I>en route</I>.

Just when I was about to approve a consignment of  anti-personnel
grenades to Iceland, my screen cleared, to be replaced by Emergency
Protocol B. Simultaneously, the red alert started up. This seldom
happened. We usually gobbled up DDOS attacks and kept going. And I had
noticed that all the orders that got through had looked real and unique.
A typical Denial of Service attack tended to be a flood of
near-identical orders with nonsense items. The front-end filter just
threw them out and we never saw them on the shop floor. It wouldn't have
slowed our system down unless the combined speed of the attackers caused
a bottleneck in the input. Our bandwidth was supposed to be the
biggest on the net.

Protocol B required the twenty section heads to  assemble in the
conference room. By the time we reached the conference room, the sirens
had stopped, but the red strobes were still flashing irritatingly. The
big boss, Adrian Dolphgren (called "Adolf" behind his back) started
talking even before the last section leaders had arrived. I was standing
near the door.

Jake, the crazy kid from Music, was jabbering like an idiot as usual,
making faces and  staggering around in a comic fashion till Adolf paused
and glared at him.

According to Adolf, something very strange was happening this morning.
We were sustaining a very powerful internet attack by unknown persons or
organisations. It was necessary that no panic take place while we await
the end of the surge. Then the door behind Adolf opened, and a man in a
military uniform walked in and shot Adolf with a Remington
Suppressant&trade; SuperTazer (I recognise all the products in my
section). Adolf
fell to the floor of the stage and flopped around like a beached fish.

Jake the Comic gave a hysterical giggle, others stood up, or flung
themselves on the floor, I ran out the door into the corridor. There
were uniforms in both directions and a fire door opposite me. I hit the
release bar and tumbled out into the thick rhododendron bush which had
been growing up against the exit for years.<div class=pullquote>Who
<i>are</i> these guys?</div>

I would like to pretend I was showing presence of mind, but it was just
panic really. I extracted myself from the bush and ran. I had never been
outside the building in the fresh air before. We were always bussed back
and forth from the hotel along the access road, and it was drummed into
us that no-one was allowed to walk around in the security zone, and
certainly never in the de-militarized zone that surrounded the security
zone.

Behind, I heard gunfire and someone running after me, so I kept going
till I hit the razor wire fence, which tore a chunk out of my face and
flung me back to the ground, where Spiros tripped over me and fell
against the barbs too. Neither of us seemed to feel any pain at that
stage.

"What the hell was that?" whispered Spiros.

"Search me."

"Who <i>are</i> these guys?" he persisted.

"No idea, but we'd better get moving."

"Where to? This fence is right around the building except for the gate
at the access road, and you can bet they've  got <i>that</i> sewn up."

"All I can say is that I've seen wild deer inside the wire, and I don't
think Adolf is in the organic venison business. So there must be
breaks."

"Into the DMZ?" said Spiros. "Isn't that dangerous?"

"More dangerous than these guys in fashionable camouflage with their
barely legal projectile weapons?"

"Maybe."

"Suit yourself," I suggested, "But I'm looking for a way out of here." I
headed off, following the fence as well as I could, given the density of
the bushes, in a somewhat northerly direction. On Google Maps, for
political reasons, the whole DMZ shows up as a vague blurry area, and
Amazon's British DMZ headquarters, from which we'd just effected a hasty
exit, doesn't appear at all. I could hear Spiros struggling along behind
me.

It was easier than I'd hoped. One section of the fence had been
flattened by a falling pine tree. Obviously, fence maintenance was not a
high priority round here, because the fence section had been on the
ground long enough for this year's bracken to grow through it, providing
a cushion across which deer and other animals had trampled a clear path.

Fifty years ago, when the DMZ had been established by the United Nations
to separate the combatants, this had all been farmland and National
Park. Now it was secondary temperate forest, vigorous young trees, pine
and birch mostly, growing too closely together, threaded through with
thorny brambles. It was wounding work, and the razor-wire gashes were
soon supplemented by deep scratches.

"Where are we going?" asked Spiros.

I showed him my OnoTab.  "See! GPS shows us here on the map, in this
blurred area, but, to the east of us, there's a road stopping short of
the DMZ on the Scottish side, and what's probably the same road stopping
short on the English side here, so if we walk east, we should hit this
road, even though it's probably disused, turn right, walk a bit, and
we're back in England."

"There'll be a border post."

"So? They'll scan your arfid chip, check your visa status, and wave you
through."

"I suppose..."

I set my tab on id-detect, and waved it over the nape of Spiros's neck.
Nothing. "Oh!"

"'s OK. Mine's on my forehead. Don't ask. Born in Igoumenitsa.
Different."

Sure enough, scanning his forehead worked, and his ID checked out. The
angry comment on the visa permissions box about us trespassing in the
DMZ was a common factor of our work at Amazon. For tax purposes, the
company had done a deal with the UN, Scotland, and England to operate
inside a compound within the DMZ, but we were constantly badgered by the
robots of the UN border agency.

Despite the handy GPS on my tab, I drifted off course, forced by the
thickets of gorse and elder, and by boggy sections in which stagnant
water shone with oily rainbows, to stumble three kilometres in every
other direction for each kilometre gained eastwards. Even then, we
almost missed the roadway. Fifty years of abandonment meant that the
grass, weeds, trees, bushes and weather had turned a highway into a zone
of only slightly less dense vegetation.<div class=pullquote>The men
stood under an automimetic canopy. They didn't look friendly.</div>

Fifty-one years ago, before handing the situation to the UN, the US army
had halted the seemingly unstoppable Scottish advance just short of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The final advance of the Scottish army had reached
and passed Hadrian's Wall for most of its length - the traditional
aspiration of Scots since the Romans left in 410 AD. It was the US army,
coming to the rescue of England on behalf of the UN, who established the
DMZ somewhat north of the battle line, but still South of the historical
border between Scotland and England. So, for the last half century, both
Berwick-on-Tweed and Carlisle, previously North of England cities, had
been Scottish. The DMZ, averaging about twenty-five kilometres in width,
comprised mostly moorland, woodland, former farmland and a small
national park. No-one was allowed to live in the DMZ, and entry was
strictly controlled by the UN Peace Keeping Force. There were few
dwellings, and they were all uninhabited.

It was, therefore, something of a surprise to us, when passing through a
wooded area where trees arched across the road, to find our way blocked
by what at first seemed a thick grove of rhododendron bushes. On closer
approach, this resolved itself into a barricade manned by several men in
active camouflage battledress. Only their disembodied faces stood out in
view, as their uniforms merged with the background. Their faces, that
is, and the uncamouflaged Barrett 0.3 auto rifles and Hitachi 45 machine
pistols they carried. The background foliage itself turned out to be the
LiveCamo version of the Lexus Stealth 20 main battle tank.  Most of
which high-tech military materiel I knew was exclusively available from
Amazon, so it must have been sold by my section - probably in that
suspicious-looking, yet legal, purchase of equipment by the tiny country
of Andorra, including thousands of automatic rifles and twenty-five
Lexus Stealth 20s.

The men stood under an automimetic canopy. They didn't look friendly.

"The UN, thank God," said Spiros.

"I doubt it. Where's their blue helmets?"

The only unarmed one was wearing the same camo as the others, but he
carried an air of authority. "Major Mackenzie," he said, "Who the hell
are you?"  We must have looked a sight with our torn and bloodstained
clothing and the razor wire wounds.

Our explanation cut no ice, and we were handled firmly, deprived of our
tabs, phones and G-lenses, given camo gear to wear, and marched under
escort along forest paths, glimpsing camo-suited men, state-of-the-art
covert tents, stealth-equipped vehicles and equipment from time to time.
While an old pale blue Chinook helicopter clattered overhead, we were
told to stand still, then were hurried on, passing along a trench roofed
over with more stealth fabric, forming a makeshift tunnel, the pattern
of leaves on the upper surface trembling in a electronic simulated
breeze.

<p class=drop>They interviewed me in an underground chamber fitted with
multiple microphones, speakers and screens. As I was pushed roughly in,
I saw my interlocutor, a small, muscular man in khaki casual dress. He
appeared to be smoking an old-fashioned cigarette, the kind with tobacco
in a paper tube. He introduced himself as Major Geddes, Intelligence
Section. He made it clear he was particularly irritated that we'd
been wandering about in the DMZ with live GPS and internet running on my
OnoTab.

"I don't suppose the blacks and slants could see you, but Google sure as
hell knew where you were." The 'blacks' and 'slants' he referred to were
presumably the Nigerians and Cambodians of whom the UN Regulatory
Authority (GB DMZ) was currently composed, and who had often been
publicly criticised for slackness. "In any case, you were radiating
infrared. Any UN helicopter should have spotted you right away."

I said: "We'd have been grateful. They might have given us a lift out of
the DMZ."

"Unlikely. They'd have locked you up for trespass and possible
subversive intent. No-one's allowed in the DMZ. You know that, don't
you?"

"It's your fault we were out there. What were you thinking of,
raiding Amazon HQ?"

"So you're from Amazon. What made you think it was us that raided you?"

"Well it wasn't the UN. And the guys were in uniform, with weapons. I
notice your lot answer the description. Who else?"

"I promise you it wasn't us. We've sent a unit to investigate."

I said: "All we want to do is get back to England and find out what's
going on with our HQ. What are you doing here anyway? You're not the UN
and this is the DMZ."

"Since you are to be our guests, because we can't release you to tell
anyone we're here, I don't suppose it matters. You will very soon guess
that we are units of the Scottish Army. Now, are you American or
Canadian? I can never tell."

"American. Working for an American company - Amazon."

"And your companion?"

"Spiros? Greek, I as far as I know."

"Then you are our enemies. Civilians?"

"Of course." <div class=pullquote>Our pay reflects the near-monopoly
Amazon enjoys.</div>

"Our allies are the United Federation of Europe and also Canada. It was
you Americans who stopped our legitimate conquest of England fifty years
ago, and it is Greece - the other defector from Federated Europe - which
now finances the degenerate state of England."

"But we were legitimately working in the DMZ. We have nothing to do with
your international quarrel."

"In a sense, you do. Your company has spent most of its life trying to
dodge tax. In this recent deal, the tiny percentage of your gross profit
you pay to England is larger than the microscopic levy you pay to
Scotland, and the pocket change you pay to the UN is even smaller.
Meanwhile, you have contrived to rob both countries of their
industries."

"Sorry about that, Major, but we personally had no part in those
negotiations, though I confess our pay reflects the near-monopoly Amazon
enjoys."

"Nevertheless, you have seen our presence here. You know, or suspect,
that we have an invasion force concealed here in the DMZ."

Up to this point, I had neither known nor suspected any such thing. But
all this camouflage, the tanks, why not? It really was the only thing
that made some kind of sense when I thought about it, however laughable.

"Why?" I asked, "Your conflict was a generation ago."

"Because invasion and occupation of one country by another is the only
way that the United Kingdom can be restored. England, frankly, hasn't
got the guts. Scotland was always the backbone of the British Army."

I was lost for words at what seemed such an unfeasible strategy, but I
didn't want to seem disagreeable, and made a grunt of semi-agreement.

Geddes continued: "Anyway, we only have your word that you came from the
Amazon installation, and, in any event, here you stay until we can get
you interned in Jedburgh."

<p class=drop>The room had a thin green carpet, a dozen folding chairs,
and a framed photo of Scotland's current president, Oliver Pike. I'd
been locked in the underground room for an hour or so when the door
opened and Spiros entered, followed by a trolley with a couple of plates
of porridge and bottles of Olde Highland Spring water - both sustaining
rather than appetising. Spiros had experienced a similar interview to
mine, though he had taken a swing at Geddes when he heard he was to be
interned and had been overpowered by Geddes himself. Shortly thereafter,
the food trolley was removed, and an AVframe was delivered and hung
rather irreverently on the same hook as Oliver Pike, partially covering
his disconcertingly liquid cow-like eyes.

We made a few gestures at the AVframe and managed to get the news, but
could not elicit sound above an inaudible whisper, lacking, as we did,
knowledge of the exact series of gestures required. After a headline
story apparently describing a flare-up between New Israel and New
Palestine, there appeared a shaky vid of our Amazon HQ, apparently taken
from somewhere well outside the DMZ using a hand-held telefoto-equipped
phonepad. The vid showed the Amazon sign being torn off the building and
lowered. Next, a new set of letters was being hoisted into position.

"Good God!" said Spiros, "It's one of my best suppliers! Bayer, the Euro
Chemical firm. What can they gain by taking us over?"

Sure enough, the letters b, a and y were already in place, and an e was
being hoisted up. But the e was fastened in front of the b, and no
further letters were added.

Spiros and I spent a frustrating five weeks in the Jedburgh isolation
camp. We were in company with a number of poachers who had made the DMZ
their private estate until they strayed, like us, into a Scottish
headquarters area. There was also a rather cheery group of smugglers who
had been doing good business trading goods by sea between Scotland and
England. They had been intercepted by an ancient Yarrow frigate crewed
by the Scottish National Navy

We were released the day the invasion began.

<p class=drop>My current position at eBay (GB DMZ) Inc. is not
significantly different from my my old one at Amazon, though I'm now in
Power. Turnover isn't as great in my new section, but you don't have to
facilitate many multi-GigaWatt Siemens Nuclear Generators to earn a good
commission. The secret of the takeover was that eBay negotiated a
slightly higher rate of tax with the surrounding countries and the UN,
and, in return, nobody got in their way. So Amazon was squeezed
out, and since the DMZ is no country's sovereign territory, no-one's
going to be prosecuted for the armed attack on Amazon. That's commerce
today. No-one died. Adolf, richly rewarded with a compensation claim, is
my boss again.

As everyone knows, the Scottish invasion came to nought; casualties were
few and mostly accidental; no territory was taken. The cries of
"Remember 1314!" were soon stilled. Microsoft Corporation's security
arm, Blackmarch, saw to that, outnumbering, out-manoeuvering and
out-computing the Scottish army. The 'blacks' and 'slants' had not been
totally incompetent. Blackmarch had anticipated the assault using
intelligence supplied by the UN Regulatory Authority and had placed an
invisible and effectively invincible force a few kilometres inside
England. Happily, the bulk of the Scottish invasion force was
subsequently subcontracted to Microsoft, and now works for Blackmarch,
whose presence in troubled areas of the world ensures that global
commerce is never seriously threatened, whatever local rivalries may
arise.

[*ITEM] A Small Intrusion

[*AUTHOR] Les Sklaroff

[*BLURB] Writer's Block with Alarms and Excursions
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"><i>Horror?  How hard could it be?</i>
pondered aspiring bestseller Maurice Berrington Grale, shivering a
little as the wind whined through the cracks where putty had crumbled in
the window of the cramped upstairs flat where his ideas gestated.
<i>First, set a credible scene, maybe with just a hint of tension</i>.
He tried to pull the curtains closer together, shutting out the
hostility of the night, but as always they failed to meet properly
because of the three hooks missing from the rail and the bulk of the
antique trunk at their foot.  The fitful flapping at the central gap
irritated him.  He grabbed at the old swivel chair he had rescued from a
skip back in the summer, to the evident displeasure of his downstairs
neighbour.  It was worn, but serviceable, wobbling a bit on its castors
as he sat down rather heavily, to face the bland grey screen.  <i>Now
concentrate</i>, he told himself sternly.  <i>Don't get distracted</i>.
He held his fingers poised above the keyboard like a pianist inwardly
preparing to commit to the first note.

He waited for inspiration to strike.  And waited.  Nothing came.  He
resisted the urge to type random letters in the unlikely hope that they
would somehow form coherent words.  Something buzzed loudly past his
ear, causing him to jerk his head back.  The abrupt movement unbalanced
the chair, which toppled sideways, spilling him in an ungainly heap on
the floor.  He swore, rubbing a bruised elbow.  <i>What the hell was
that?</i>  Peering round the room he tried to identify the source of the
buzzing, but it was masked by the bitonal shrilling of cold air from
behind the curtains.  Responding belatedly to the sound of movement from
above, Mrs Feeney, the old woman downstairs, banged on her ceiling with
what he presumed was her broomstick.

Setting the chair back upright, he noticed that the supporting frame
below the seat had become slack, which meant that one of the retaining
screws must have fallen out.  He spent the next few minutes on hands and
knees, searching the threadbare carpet until he found it, and then had
to hunt in the toolbox under the desk for a matching screwdriver whose
quartered tip had not been worn ineffectually smooth.

Maurice resumed his seat, scowling with determination.  <i>Where was I?
Oh yes, setting a scene, before that damned insect got in.  He fervently
hoped it wasn't a wasp</i>.  He had a dread of wasps, remembering with a
shudder what had happened in that pool when he was a kid.  Thankfully,
he didn't remember the pain, but his arm had swollen like a balloon.
<i>The kitchen door's closed, so it's still in the room somewhere!</i>
The conclusion was reinforced by the prickling sensation on his scalp
and neck.  Nevertheless, he tried hard to concentrate.  <i>Right, say
the opening's finished, then you've got to lure the reader -no</i>, (he
chided himself) <i>readers into the heart of the story, where something
weird or gruesome probably happens, and then deftly weave your way
towards the chilling shock of the ending</i>.  He sat back, carefully,
and regardless of the fact he had not actually written anything yet,
began considering possible scenarios.

<i>Preferably not about wasps</i>, taunted the inner voice.

Perversely, now convinced it <i>was</i> a wasp, he could think about
nothing else.

<i>A hot day, somewhere in southern Spain.  Cornering sharply, a fruit
truck overturns, trapping a hapless cyclist.  Seemingly from all
directions comes the sound of fierce droning.

No!

Some adventurous children lever their way into a derelict barn.  A dusty
shaft of sunlight illuminates something the size of a football. Soon the
air fills with piercing screams.

No!!

A quarantine zone is established in a fifteen-mile radius around an
agricultural research station in northern India, following a series of
unexplained deaths.  There are emergency requests for antihistamine and
other medical supplies from places scattered far beyond the specified
area.

Enough, enough! </i>  He felt queasy and vulnerable.  He knew he needed
to get rid of the thing, or the thought of its lurking presence would
continue to bother him.  As a precautionary measure, he tucked the
bottoms of his trousers into his socks.  Now he must find something to
protect his head and hands.  The wooden trunk in front of the window
held most of his clothing; there was no room in the flat for such
luxuries as a wardrobe or a chest of drawers.  Reluctantly parting the
curtains further, he lifted the lid and pulled out a hooded anorak and a
pair of leather gloves stiff with disuse.  As an afterthought, he
rummaged at the bottom of the trunk until he found the flimsy silk scarf
printed with swirling patterns, a memento of a grandmother he had hardly
known.  It still smelled faintly of mould, talcum powder and lavender as
he veiled his face, tucking the edges well into the hood of the anorak,
and knotting the cord securely under his neck.  He fumbled for the
gloves and dragged them over his fingers.  With his vision now clouded,
his hearing muffled, breathing constricted and sense of touch impaired,
Maurice felt slightly safer.   He was armoured against the intruder. All
he had to do was find it.

<i>The torch.  Get the torch</i>.  It hung from a strap behind the door,
ready for emergencies.  An old heavy duty model with a rubber casing.
Maurice switched it on.  The bulb emitted a weak gleam.  He shook it.
The tiny filament glowed orange for a moment, then died. <i>Damn! </i>
He couldn't remember when he had last changed the batteries, but knew he
had no spares.  The only other source of light that was in any way
portable was his desk-lamp - an unwieldy anglepoise with a solid base,
but quite a long cord.  It would have to do.  The remaining problem was
selecting a means of capture.

Swatting was an option he would rather avoid, for fear of aggravating
the wasp.  He looked around the room for a container of some kind. Cups
and glasses were in the kitchen, behind the closed door, as were any
plastic pots or tubs.  On his shelves were books, a few ornaments, a
shell or two, some mineral specimens, a small pile of coins: nothing
remotely helpful.  <i>What about the desk? </i>  Aging computer,
monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, the lamp, a stack of paper, a
stapler, a jar of pens and pencils.  The drawers contained CDs, DVDs,
other stationery items and the usual miscellaneous clutter that tends to
accumulate over time.  Had he missed anything?  <i>Of course, the jar!
</i>   He stepped over to the desk, pulled open the stationery drawer,
and a little clumsily (unwilling to remove the gloves) emptied out the
jar's contents.

<i>Lastly, something to cap it with... </i> There were some old unused
postcards at the back of the drawer.  Fumbling awkwardly, he extracted
one.  Blurrily, through the veil, he recognised the blues and yellows of
Van Gogh's 'Wheatfield with Crows'.  <i>Do crows eat wasps? </i>  He
shook his head, trying to rid himself of unwanted images. <i>'Wheatfield
with Wasps' would be just as valid. </i>  To avoid accidents, he put the
jar and card on the floor beside the desk before unwinding and paying
out the cord leading from the wall-socket to the anglepoise lamp.
Cradling the lamp he carried it as far as the cord would reach and
slowly began sweeping its beam systematically up and down the walls and
furniture.  It illuminated the neglected crevices where strands and
webby clumps of dust had accreted.  It found imperfections in the
wallpaper, picked out the wood-grain along the shelves, revealed, on the
topmost shelf, even through the haze of musty silk, the bright tremor of
wings edging up the spine of a book.

A cold determination overrode his squeamishness.  Maurice quietly set
the lamp down, tilting it so that the light continued to shine upwards.
Even at full stretch he was not quite tall enough to reach the shelf
unaided.  There was a short step-ladder at the back of the kitchen
cupboard, but the only object of a suitable height within reach was the
trunk.  He would have to pull it across the room.   Raising the lid for
a second time, he hastily scooped out most of the contents with both
arms, piling them haphazardly on the floor.  He kept squinting back up
at the top shelf  to make sure the thing was still there, then, bent
low, with all his strength he began to tug the heavy trunk over the
carpet.

The tacks holding down the edges of the carpet soon gave way.
Obstructive wrinkles gathered, making progress increasingly difficult.
He thought of the builders of Stonehenge, lugging sarsen stones weighing
up to fifty tons for twenty miles.  <i>I expect they had ropes and
rollers, the lucky sods</i>.  He redoubled his efforts.  With each
indrawn breath the scarf was sucked over his mouth and nostrils.  There
was an unpleasantly stale taste on his tongue. From below the sensitive
Mrs Feeney was provoked into a sustained fit of banging.  "<i>Shut up,
you stupid old bat! </i>" he grunted, channelling all his exasperation
into another heave.  Snagged on a ruck in the carpet, the trunk lurched
sharply forward, sending Maurice reeling helplessly backwards into the
unforgiving cast-iron solidity of the room's sole radiator.

Maurice was oblivious to the collateral damage as the lamp's jointed arm
buckled, dislocating the springs and shattering the light-bulb. Mrs
Feeney's peevish hammering faded to a thrumming vibration, faint but
inescapable.  At the core of his own encroaching darkness it sounded
very like the susurration of a myriad insect wings.

[*ITEM] Playing Around with Arthur

[*AUTHOR] Gil Williamson

[*BLURB] Golf: "I never learned anything from a match that I won."
<small> Bobby Jones </small>

[*DESCRIPTION]<p class=drop>They presented an unusual pair, these
golfers: Professor Edward Latimer, a middle-aged man of medium height,
and his companion, a larger than life young fellow in immaculate golf
apparel whose fluidly swift movements betrayed the fact that he was an
android.

"Now, Arthur," began the Professor, "This will be your first ever round
of golf, and we shall score it hole by hole. OK?"

"Yes, Professor," said the android - his lips moved, but the voice
seemed to come from his chest, "I have perfected golf on the driving
range you took me to. You told me that I can hit a golf ball very far
and very straight."

"Yes, you can, Arthur, but, while it helps to hit a long, straight ball,
there is more to the game than that. The driving range is a flat, open
field. A golf course is not."

"I understand."

"OK. I'll just drive off." The Professor was a good golfer. He hit his
ball to the corner where the fairway curved gently left - perfect for a
second shot to the green.

Arthur smoothly placed the ball on the tee peg, and selected the largest
club from the gleaming cluster of golf clubs in their brand new bag. He
hit the ball in the same direction as the Professor's. It reached the
corner and kept going, without turning, and finished forty yards from
the fairway, in thick grass.

"Ah, Arthur, I should have explained. It's much easier to hit a ball
when it's on the fairway."

"My ball is closer to the green than yours, Professor."

"Yes it is. Let's try to find it."

They found the ball, but when Arthur tried to hit it, he managed to
uproot an impressive amount of grass, but the thick stems turned the
head of his club, and the ball didn't make much progress. It took a few
more mighty blows, with collateral damage to the local flora, to get the
ball on the green.

Meanwhile, the Professor had reached the green with his second stroke.
Putting was another revelation to Arthur. The putting green at the
driving range had not featured any slopes, ridges or dips. On this real
green, Arthur's putts, driven directly at the hole, veered, overshot,
stopped short, or, due to excess speed, skipped over the hole in an
almost comic fashion, while the Professor's ball fell in the hole at the
second attempt.

"My hole, I think," said the Professor.

"Certainly, I had sixteen strokes on that hole," agreed Arthur, "I
evidently have much to learn. On this first hole, I learned to keep my
ball on the fairway, even at the sacrifice of distance. Also, I learned
that, in putting, I must calculate the vector of the ball, taking into
account friction, angle and topography." Nevertheless, Arthur sounded
vaguely irritated. Professor Latimer observed a discordant note in his
wonderfully modulated voice.

"Well done, Arthur. Next hole."

On the second hole, Arthur learned that  fairways, as well as greens,
exhibited uneven topography, that a ball travelled much further downhill
than on the level, and that due to these factors, a golf ball, though it
was hit straight at the green, might arrive in the sand bunker behind
the green.  Further, he discovered that hitting a ball out of a bunker
was not an easy skill.

On the third hole, adverse gusts of wind caused Arthur's ball to veer
sharply left, off the fairway. Following the Professor's advice, Arthur
improved his ability to hit a ball out of thick grass by using an
elevated club, bringing it down more vertically on the ball to reduce
the amount of grass the club had to pass through before it reached the
ball. Arthur grumbled at this stage that it had been unfair of the
Professor not to fully brief him before they started. In all his
dealings with Arthur, the Professor had not previously noticed grumbling
as an aspect of Arthur's behaviour.

"I'm three holes up," Professor Latimer remarked. "There are fifteen to
go. You have an excellent chance of beating me. You are a fast learner.
Your play is greatly improved."

On the fourth hole, Arthur learned that, although the canopy of an oak
tree is ninety percent air, the ten percent of leaves, twigs and small
branches effectively block at least fifty percent of the paths that a
ball might follow through the tree.

On the fifth hole, Arthur attempted to reach the green by projecting a
ball at a low angle of incidence across a lake, relying on the skipping
effect to keep it above water. It sank without trace some yards from
the other side. Arthur was heard to complain that Barnes Wallis had some
explaining to do.

"Five up, thirteen to play," said the Professor.

Hole six, par three, a short drive across a chasm to a small green.
Arthur remarked, with a slight tremor in his voice, that his smallest
pitching iron would be sufficient to reach the green. The Professor
required a six iron, at least four clubs bigger, but his shot arrived
comfortably on the green, and rolled past the pin to the back of the
green.

Arthur appeared to take careful note of the range, then whacked his ball
high in the air. The trajectory was perfect, the angle of descent to the
green almost vertical, the terminal velocity extremely high. The ball
entered the surface of the green, and was so plugged that it disappeared
from sight altogether. The Professor noticed that the drizzle which had
begun was actually steaming off Arthur's clothes. He touched the
android, and realised that Arthur was running extremely hot.

"Don't worry, Arthur, we are permitted to dig the ball out and repair
the green, without penalty,"  said the Professor.

"I am aware of that," replied Arthur, "Having Googled the circumstance
just now."

They disinterred the ball, and Arthur putted it straight in the hole. A
birdie, and a win! His first.

Score: The Professor - Four up.

On the seventh hole, the Professor succeeded in halving the hole, by
playing the ball from the green-side bunker, straight in the hole.

"I believe," said Arthur, having apparently made some more internet
searches, "That result is known as a 'golden ferret'. It is considered
'good luck'. I understand that luck is defined as a result which is
unlikely, given the probability of success. So good luck for you, is bad
luck for me."

"Very good, Arthur, but I should point out that Gary Player, a famous
golfer, once remarked: 'The more I practice, the luckier I get'."

This remark was a mistake. Arthur apparently found the concept extremely
hard to comprehend, and the Professor finally had to concede that the
statement was possibly ironic. Arthur had already been told that, like
most artificial intelligences, he would not be expected to understand
irony.

The Professor won the eighth hole, again with a flukish shot. His second
shot, from 150 yards, finished only six inches from the pin. Arthur had
played the hole perfectly, with a very long drive and a magnificent
pitch to the green, but required two putts.

The Professor now observed that Arthur had become even hotter. There
were little pinking noises coming from his chest, and a smell of
scorching. "I think, perhaps, Arthur, that we probably ought to stop
now. It's my belief that you are over-heating."

Arthur's voice was very hoarse when he replied: "I generate more heat
when my brain is working hard. My temperature at present is within the
maximum permitted. I would like to continue."

"I cannot advise it, Arthur. We ought to stop and let you cool down."

"But I am losing, Professor. If we stopped now I would be unable to win,
and I think that would be bad for me."

The Professor decided at that stage that it would probably be safer to
carry on, but to contrive to let Arthur win, as he seemed to be agitated
by losing.

This worked for a while. Arthur's temperature dropped as he won the next
three holes, but on the twelfth, he noticed that the Professor was
missing putts that he would normally have got very easily

"Professor. I think that you may be deliberately losing these holes.
That is not in keeping with what I understand to be the spirit of the
game."

"Not at all, Arthur, I was just a little pre-occupied with your
temperature. I'll try a little harder."

The Professor contrived to touch Arthur's back briefly, and discovered
that he had, indeed, cooled down a great deal. And Arthur then continued
to play very consistently, so that by the beginning of the seventeenth
and penultimate hole, Arthur was actually one hole up. And his voice
had lost that rough edge.

Arthur's drive at the seventeenth was long, the trajectory only a few
degrees low, and it was indeed unfortunate that his ball landed in the
brook.

"I calculated that very carefully," he complained, "The ball should have
stopped several feet short of the water. The physics was correct, I'm
sure, taking into account club head speed, attack angle, dynamics of a
sphere with dimples in it, viscosity of the air, bounce coefficient of
the fairway, all based on previous observation."

He was getting hot again. The Professor said: "The reason, I think, was
that you were teeing off from an uneven surface, so that your left foot
was slightly lower than your right, introducing a slight downward
adjustment to launch angle. Never mind, you can drop your ball on this
bank of the stream and still be on the green for three. I am unlikely to
get there in less because I simply haven't got your power."

Arthur was still fuming - literally - when they reached the brook. The
ball was in very shallow water, just covered. Something resembling a
growl issued from him.

"Take it easy, Arthur," said the Professor. "You are one up. Even if you
halve the next two holes, you'll still win. Just drop the ball this side
of the water for a one-shot penalty, and hit it to the green."

Arthur's grating voice was barely comprehensible: "That will cost me a
shot. I can hit it from the water."

"Believe me, Arthur, many fine golfers have come to grief in this
situation. No less a golfer than Tony Lema gave a hint for hitting a
ball out of water."

"What was the hint?"

"Don't."

"Don't what?"

"He meant 'don't hit a ball out of water'."

Arthur turned his head towards the Professor. Although the expression on
Arthur's face was quite neutral, the silent gaze was somehow
threatening. Arthur chose a club, and stood up to his ankles in the
stream. Steam rose. With a mighty heave, Arthur's club plunged into the
water. A cloud of spray enveloped both of them. Arthur steamed. The
Professor dripped.

"Where is the ball?" Arthur croaked, peering up the fairway with his
Zeiss x-eyes.

The Professor took a couple of cautious steps backwards before
indicating that the ball was still in the water, about a handsbreadth
from its original position, but in deeper water.

Seriously alarming noises were now issuing from Arthur. He erupted from
the stream, stood a moment, then flung the club away. His clothes
smoked, then caught fire. When the clothes had dropped away in burning
shreds and ashes, Arthur's synthetic skin could be seen to be melting,
and metal, circuit boards and cables could be seen. The machine that had
been Arthur simply died before the Professor's eyes, collapsing half
into the water.

<p class=drop>The University Board of Inquiry convened a few weeks
later.  Professor Edward Latimer stood accused of having negligently
caused a valuable android, the property of the University, to wit:
Arthur, to self-destruct while the Professor was entertaining himself
with a frivolous game. Further, that he had negligently permitted said
Arthur to be out in the rain and to walk in water, promoting further
damage and ingress of foreign bodies. In addition he was to be billed
for one almost-new golf club that was found to be missing from Arthur's
golf bag, a set of brand new golf trousers and a second-hand Tiger Woods
shirt.

One particularly meticulous board member was assigned to describing in
detail the damage suffered by Arthur, though he generously discounted
water immersion as a primary cause of breakdown, Arthur having been
built to exacting waterproofing standards. The main point of failure
originated, apparently, in the 'personality' module of the AI processor,
which seemed to have become overheated and overloaded, spreading high
temperatures to all sectors of the android's intellectual functions.

The Bursar asked the Professor why he had found it necessary to train
the robot to play golf, when his physical capability and comprehension
of competitive games had already been clearly established by earlier
experiments.

"Ah, Bursar, I did not set out to test Arthur's ability to master
physical skills or to use his logical, range-finding and calculation
skills. He did, in fact, perform surprisingly well in those departments.
By the end of the round, he was, technically, a better golfer than 90%
of human golfers. He was winning a game which, at the halfway stage, he
seemed certain to lose.

"No. I was seeking to test his ability to cope with frustration, stress
and disappointment. He was subjected to bad luck, unpredictability of
playing conditions, adverse weather, and the possibility of losing a
game that he felt he should, in all justice, have won.

"I am sure that the golfing members of the Board would agree that there
is no better test of mental fortitude than the game of golf."

Much nodding and murmurs of agreement ensued and Professor Latimer was
exonerated of the main charges, though he was still required to
reimburse the University for the burnt clothing, a missing 7 iron, three
Titleist golf balls and a bag of 8 cm tee pegs.

[*ITEM]  Baker's Dozen

[*AUTHOR] Martin Clark

[*BLURB] Battery life is always going to be a problem.
		
[*DESCRIPTION]<p class="drop"> I sidled through the early-evening crowd
patronising Café Casablanca in search of the owner, Sully Baker. He was
sitting alone in a side booth, an untouched beer on the table in front
of him. I  tipped my hat. "I'm Rudi Hess. I understand you wanted to see
me, Mister Baker?"

Baker was a big guy; bald, heavy across the shoulders, like a boxer gone
to fat. He gestured to the seat opposite. "Call me Sully."

I sat down, conscious of his two thick-necked bodyguards regarding me in
a <i>very</i> unfriendly manner. Sully had a lot of enemies and no
friends worth a damn; not exactly a career criminal but someone with a
direct approach to problem solving, as the saying goes.

He cracked his knuckles. "So you got my message. The question being,
Mister Private Detective, can you help me?"

I frowned. "Well, the idea of someone spiriting away a dozen animatronic
hostess dolls only to return them before dawn the next morning sounds a
bit, ah, convoluted."

"Dolls? No, not <i>dolls</i>. These are Uber-Leiben synthetics.  Series
Four, I grant you, but good enough to pass muster."

"Androids? You moving into the escort business, Sully?"

"Around here? He shrugged, "There's too much competition from cut-price
organic. No, what I need them for is more, ah, cultural. I need them to
form a choir."

I blinked. "A choir? As in singing?"

"It's for my daughter, Grace. She has this High School talent contest
coming up and wants to wow them with a retro homage to 'Sister Act'. But
for that she needs a gospel choir as backing."

"So hire one. That has to be a damn sight less expensive than shelling
out for twelve synthetics, even from an obsolete line."

Sully shook his head. "The students aren't allowed any adult assistance
on stage, but I've checked the fine-print and it says nothing about
androids. They can carry a tune and I've hired a choreographer to teach
them the basics."

"OK, so what's gone wrong?"

"Every morning, despite being left on charge overnight, their power
packs are zapped - and before you ask, the hardware checks out fine. As
it stands we're only getting a few hours' use out of them each day."

I stroked my chin, mentally chewing things over. "Uh-huh, so where did
these problem children hail from?"

My proto-client looked slightly embarrassed. "A lap-dancing bar in
Foundry. I got a good price on them." He sounded defensive.

I sighed. "Oh, I just bet you did. The Series Four have organic brains,
Sully, so when the  new Man Act comes
into force you won't be able to own them at all. Offer them a job,
maybe, but they could just as easy walk away. Face it, you got sold a
pup."

Sully shrugged. "The contest takes place well before this misguided
emancipation hits the statute books. Look, I'll pay two thousand if you
can figure out what's going on and put a stop to it. Interested?"

"Oh, yeah, I'll take the case, and you can throw in a pair of tickets
for this talent contest as well - I wouldn't miss it for the world. Now,
I suppose you tried keeping your divas under surveillance? Left someone
to watch over them?"

"The warehouse is run by my son, Victor, but, yeah, he tried that."

"And?"

"And nothing. CCTV went on the fritz for no good reason and the night
watchman woke up the next morning unable to remember a damn thing."

I frowned. "Drugged?"

"Tested clean as a whistle. Same thing happened with <i>two</i> guys
there to keep each other awake."

"OK, so you put in cameras across the street covering the doors, you
install motion detectors, you tag the girls with locator beacons. This
isn't rocket science, Sully, I really don't see the problem."

Again he sounded defensive. "The problem is Victor. If truth be told,
he's not the sharpest tool in the box and I can't step in with any new
ideas without making him look incompetent." Sully sighed. "Kids, eh?
Look, my daughter steps up on that stage in five days and we haven't
even had a full dress rehearsal yet. What you gonna' do?"

I spread my hands. "Just call me Banquo."

"Say again?"

"The ghost at the feast, Sully, the ghost at the feast."

<p class=drop>Cutting-edge stealth technology tends to be quirky. For me
that meant a
mimetic camouflage jumpsuit with a <i>serious</i> heat exchange problem,
doubling as my personal sauna. I may have been well-nigh invisible,
squatting in a corner of the partitioned warehouse, but it was a race
between solving the case and stewing in my own sweat. Sully rode
shotgun, in a manner of speaking, via the suit's integral webcam.

Actually calling it a 'warehouse' was a misnomer. Where I was hiding had
been kitted out like back-stage at the Moulin Rouge, complete with
wardrobes, dressing tables and illuminated mirrors. Out front was a
full-sized replica of the stage to be used during the talent contest, to
ensure accurate choreography. Sully Baker was pulling out all the stops
for his little girl.

The door opened and the 'choir' filed in, shepherded by an effete,
middle-aged guy with bouffant hair. He clapped his hands. "Girls, girls,
settle down. Now, that was fine as far as it goes but if anything we
need a little <i>less</i> bump-and-grind. Yvette, Brandi, you know who
I'm talking about. Now, try and get a good night's rest and we'll try
again first-thing…" He crossed himself, "…God willing."

The choreographer flounced out past two of Victor's goons on guard in
the corridor. The door closed and the girls settled down at their
individual dressing tables, talking amongst themselves. I tried to tune
out the chatter as it was uniformly superficial - the Series Four came
with an intellect inhibitor that pretty much guaranteed an 'air-head'
outlook on life. Each chair was fitted with an induction charger so all
the girls had to do was sit on their collective asses for eight hours
and everything would be just peachy.

An hour passed, then two. I learned a lot about the latest fashions and
celebrities. I tried not to fidget. My butt got sore.

A mobile phone began to ring, the sound coming from a waste bin in the
corner. The girls looked confused. Louise, the only red-head in the
group and the one who seemed to have the most smarts, lifted it out and
answered. "Hello?...Yes, yes, I remember…How much?...I'll ask the
others." She addressed the other girls. "It's Tony-G, who used to own
us. He wants us to work for him tonight and he'll pay the going rate,
plus tips."

This provoked a burst of chatter.

"Pay us? What do we need money for?" 

"We're gonna' be people soon, dumb-ass. We'll need money while we find
jobs."

"I don't like Tony-G. He was mean to me."

"If we work tonight we'll be tired tomorrow. Mister Locarno shouts at us
if we're tired."

"Hush!" Louise glared at them. "It's a one-off and, like Tiffany said,
we're going to need money soon. Do we do this or not?" There were
murmurs of agreement. She nodded and raised the phone. "Tony-G?...Yes,
we'll do it…OK." She hung up. "He'll pick us up out back, straight
away."

Well, so far, so obvious - but they were acting like this was their
first time playing hooky, which didn't sit right. I watched as everyone
lifted their purses and Louise opened the door. Instead of being
unconscious the two heavies were on-hand to usher the girls towards the
rear loading bay - as was son and heir Victor himself.

Despite what his father thought, Victor was evidently sharp enough to
cut a deal with Tony-G, leasing the girls back to their old owner for a
percentage. So much for supporting his kid sister in her musical debut.

The head-up display on the inside of my facepiece registered Sully was
no longer viewing proceedings. This really didn't bode well for Victor
and his crew and I had no wish to face a homicide beef as an accessory
before the fact - or become an inconvenient witness. Although I'd
already earned my fee I decided keeping a lid on things was was the best
way of living long enough to enjoy it.
 
I followed the girls out into the corridor and through the warehouse,
past crates of gin and tins of beans, piled high. Louise was at the rear
of the little procession, shooing them along like a self-appointed
mother hen.

Keeping pace pushed my mimetic camouflage to the limit against a
background of patchwork plaster and dilapidated brickwork. I started
casting a flickering shadow which nipped her heels, making Louise glance
over her shoulder - and forcing me to freeze in place like a schoolyard
game of 'Statues'. She was obviously suspicious, but luckily for me
didn't have the time to check things out, and kept moving. I have to
admit that watching the sway of her hips almost made my discomfort
worthwhile - I may be shallow but I know what I like.

We reached the loading bay to find Tony-G and one of his pals standing
beside a former school bus, now fitted out as 'a unique mobile
lap-dancing experience'. It said so, right there on the side.

Floodlights turned the loading bay bright as day.

Victor and his two heavies went for their guns - then thought better of
it as they saw who was standing over by the far wall; Sully Baker and
four of <i>his</i> men - two of whom carried shotguns.

The girls squealed and crowded together. Victor looked sick to his
stomach. Tony-G went white in the face, obvious even under the harsh
lighting. I unzipped my jumpsuit with a sigh of relief and a small cloud
of steam.

Sully stepped forward, jabbing a finger at his errant offspring. "Not
one word! Not one, you understand? I got a garbage scow out of Miramar
with a pressing need for a new deckhand, and be thankful you're getting
off so lightly." He turned on Tony-G. "And <i>you</i>, you little-"

Tony-G held up his hands. "Victor came to <i>me</i>, Sully, honest! OK,
so I short-changed the girls, but a little mind-wipe never hurt anyone,
right? I mean, it's not like they're real people, when you get down to
it."

I winced. He was talking about a synaptic manipulator - designed to
selectively remove memories in trauma victims, so they could get on with
their lives. Using it for a blanket 'mind-wipe' each morning was
<i>way</i> beyond dangerous. It was a miracle none of the girls had been
reduced to gibbering idiocy.

Sully cracked his knuckles. "I want the takings from those nights you
<i>borrowed</i> my property, right? And if any of them have been damaged
so that they can't sing for my Grace, well, you best find a deep, dark
hole to hide in, Tony. A <i>really</i> deep, dark hole."

Tony-G and his pal stumbled over each other in their haste to get
aboard. The bus pulled away.

The big man turned to me. He sniffed. "You looking for a job? As in
permanent work."

I arched an eyebrow. "Like what?"

"Like I need someone to run Victor's end of the operation while he's
cooling his heels on the high seas. A monthly salary and no 'private
enterprise' on the side. You interested?"

"Maybe, maybe. One condition though." I pointed at Louise, "I get her,
when she's done singing."

Sully laughed. "Yeah, sure, come see me in the morning." My new boss and
his business associates faded into the night, taking Victor with them.

The rest of the girls scurried into the warehouse but Louise hung back.
She looked me straight in the eye. "Why me? Or do you get off on the
idea of owning someone?"

I grinned. "Why you? Well, you got the looks, the figure and  I bet -
once we yank that intellect inhibitor - the smarts as well. I'm looking
for a personal assistant, not a lap-dancer. An employee, not a piece of
property."

"I'll be a free person soon. Free to make my own way in the world."
There was a defiant tilt to her chin I found real fetching.

I took her arm and smiled. "Louise, I think this is the beginning of a
beautiful friendship."
