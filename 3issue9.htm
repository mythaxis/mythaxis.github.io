<div><i>Extractions can prove painful.</i>
<p class=drop>Close your eyes and wait for the world to begin&#133;</P> <P><P>We were to meet up at <I>The Inverted Spin</I>, a fly-boy bar and
diner near Henderson Field. I have a patch that allows me to skip titles
and intro, getting me there well ahead of the other players. Despite it
being fairly busy the big corner booth is always empty, so I scored a
beer and settled in to see who else turned up.</P> <P><P><div class=pullquote>The <I>Shadow Corporation</I> immersion game I
knew featured murder, torture, gun battles and betrayal.</div>I&#146;d played
the
earlier version of <I>Shadow Corporation</I> and
nothing much seemed to have changed; same bar staff, same customers,
same d&eacute;cor. I felt slightly smug, as knowing the plot twists
would give me a decided advantage over the other players. That might
sound a bit petty but I enjoy watching how newbies react to virtual
environments most definitely designed with malice aforethought.</P> <P><P>A man appeared at the booth, as if coming from the restrooms. It was
Vaughn, in full blown Christopher Lambert mode, circa. <I>Highlander</I>;
long rain coat, stubble, Japanese wakizashi short sword hanging under
his left armpit. </P> <P><P>He sat opposite and smiled. &quot;Duncan. It&#146;s been a
while.&quot;</P> <P><P>I saluted him with my beer bottle. &quot;Vaughn. Haven&#146;t seen you
since, what, <I>Scimitar of Symmetry?</I>&quot; We both looked at each
other for a moment, then laughed. I beat him to it. &quot;Fiona
Blair!&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;God, <I>yes!</I> She almost made the whole thing worthwhile.
You still in contact with her?&quot;</P> <P><P>I shrugged. &quot;Made the mistake of scoping her in real life. Let&#146;s
just say that she didn&#146;t quite live up to her gaming persona.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Ouch. Well, you should have known better than to try and mix
the two. What goes on spool&#133;&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Stays on spool. Yeah, yeah, I know, but I&#146;m an optimistic kind
of guy.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn motioned to the waitress for a beer. &quot;Not in here. Aren&#146;t
you supposed to be the moody ex-fighter pilot with a dark secret?
Brooding, cynical, but who comes back for the survivors instead of
flying off to safety?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;And you, the stone killer with a conscience? The former
corporate assassin turned mercenary who goes up against the end of
chapter bad guys?&quot; </P> <P><P>&quot;One of two in this edition. Apparently someone is holding my
daughter hostage to ensure my co-operation.&quot;</P> <P><P>I grinned. &quot;Not exactly a case of art imitating life, I grant
you. To be honest, Vaughn, I didn&#146;t see this being your kind of thing.
No guaranteed sexual encounters, for a start.&quot;</P> <P><P>He took a swig of beer. &quot;Well, I&#146;m always open to new
experiences, and- &quot;</P> <P><P>Movement at the door caught my eye and I cut across him. &quot;Aw,
<I>crap</I>, it&#146;s Ramirez. Did you know he was in on this?&quot;   </P> <P><P>Vaughn shook his head. &quot;Unfortunate coincidence. Try and play
nice, Duncan, at least until we can get the scenario to kill him
off.&quot;</P> <P><P>Ramirez rolled over to us, a big grin on his fat face. Despite the
leather flying jacket and aviator shades slipping down his nose, no one
would have mistaken him for a pilot, or even cabin crew. He was one of
those guys who seem congenitally unable to take the hint.</P> <P><P>&quot;Hi, guys! This is just great. I&#146;d no idea you two would be here
- the old gang, the three musketeers.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn muttered under his breath, &quot;More like the three amigos,
at this rate.&quot;</P> <P><P>I tried not to laugh and shifted up as Ramirez squeezed his sweaty
bulk between bench and table. For all his faults, we needed him, at least
early on. His persona would be that of a fixer; he knew someone who knew
someone who could get us anything the unfolding narrative demanded. So I
tried to play nice.</P> <P><P>&quot;No body morphing, Ramirez? You look pretty much as you do on
your player profile.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Naw! They were wanting so much extra for that, it was just
criminal. Apparently compensating charges are really steep with the new
interface. Physical dissonance they call it<I>. I</I> call it-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Looks like one of us at the door. Make that two, both
women.&quot;</P> <P><P>Even Vaughn leaned round to take a look. The first woman was a curvy
brunette with close-cropped dark hair and eye-mask makeup. She was
wearing a throat-high one piece of iridescent metallic scales that
shimmered when she walked. The second newcomer couldn&#146;t have been more
different. She looked like she&#146;d tumbled down the rabbit hole from Alice
in Wonderland, complete with head band. </P> <P><P>They walked over to us, being studiously ignored by the other
customers, and the brunette spoke. &quot;I&#146;m Mazy, and this here is
Blondie.&quot; She rolled her eyes, &quot;Seriously.&quot;</P> <P><P>I arched an eyebrow. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</P> <P><P>The almost-Alice nodded. &quot;Oh yeah. I&#146;m a big fan. The new
virtual tour is just <I>amazing</I>, and I&#146;ve been to seven gigs so
far.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;And you&#146;re here because?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Don&#146;t you know? Well, <I>apparently</I>, the head of corporate
security is modelled on Debbie herself, a full body and persona
licensing deal. So I just <I>had</I> to try this out, even though my
friend Helena says it&#146;s a bit scary.&quot;</P> <P><P>A bit scary? The <I>Shadow Corporation</I> immersion game I knew
featured murder, torture, gun battles and betrayal. Unless this new
edition had suddenly gone all fluffy-wuffy, Blondie was in for a really
bad trip.</P> <P><P>Mazy looked us over. &quot;Fixer, pilot, killer &#150; same as me. Blondie
is the hacker. We&#146;re still missing the roguish bad-boy.&quot;</P> <P><P>Ramirez pointed behind her. &quot;That looks like him now.&quot;</P> <P><P>I looked over and hung my head, sighing, eyes closed. The new arrival
was kitted out like Han Solo, minus the gun on his hip as the scenario
didn&#146;t allow for overt weaponry. Just in case we didn&#146;t get the iconic
reference he&#146;d added a shoulder bag and beat-up floppy hat. I just knew
his name would be &#145;Harrison&#146; &#150; an &uuml;ber fan boy.</P> <P><P>As he walked over I felt a tangible change in the bar. The narrative
was moving out of a holding pattern into something more directional, and
Vaughn smiled. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe its
showtime.&quot;</P> <P><P>The last of our group was, indeed, called Harrison, but I tuned out
while Ramirez made the introductions. My attention was on the door,
knowing there was an outside chance of a corporate security raid rather
than our scenario contact showing up. The game sometimes stiffed
experienced players with this hit-squad bullshit to keep us on our toes.
We&#146;d be forced to split up, scatter, and piece together the plot rather
than having it laid out for us. </P> <P><P class=drop>A group of three men entered and I relaxed. Two of them
were just
bodyguards, all impassive muscle, but the third was a showboat; white
linen suit, black shirt, black tie, cashmere coat draped over his
shoulders, greased-back curly hair and shades. This type of non-player
character I knew well, although the name kept changing.</P> <P><P>Harrison had just gotten through the round of &#145;Hellos&#146; and sat down
by the time our contact eased over. Mr Smooth gave us a brilliant smile,
complete with gold tooth. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am Juan Canasta,
entrepreneur, middleman and renowned lover. May I join you?&quot;</P> <P><P>We murmured our acceptance and Canasta handed his coat to one
bodyguard, sitting down on the chair held out by another.  He removed
his glasses and slid them into his breast pocket while a waitress placed
a glass of mineral water in front of him. With his saturnine good looks
he resembled a comedy devil in corporate mode, although I knew if we
reached the end game there wouldn&#146;t be a lot of laughs.</P> <P><P>Canasta placed an acoustic muffler on the table and background noise
dropped to almost zero. &quot;It&#146;s always best to ensure some degree of
privacy in these matters, yes? Well, ladies and gentlemen, I asked my
close personal friend and business associate, Madam Tisa, to assemble a
team at short notice, and I can see she&#146;s done me proud. I promise you
this will prove extremely lucrative, but it will not be without
risk.&quot;</P> <P><P>I didn&#146;t know Madam Tisa, obviously part of the introduction
sequence, but I could pretty much imagine the scene-setting spiel.
Blondie started, on the receiving end of a narrative prod. &quot;So, Mr
Canasta, what&#146;s the deal?&quot;</P> <P><P>He smiled in a way that was already beginning to irritate me.
&quot;Well, I represent certain interested parties, who of course wish
to remain nameless. For some time they have been working to ensure the
defection of a high-ranking executive from one of their
competitors.&quot;</P> <P><P>There was another narrative feed-line, this time from Ramirez.
&quot;Come on, Canasta, who&#146;s the target? We need to know what we&#146;re
getting in to.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;The executive in question is Jules Toba, the number three
at&#133;Sensei Industries.&quot;</P> <P><P>I smiled to myself at the momentary hesitation. It was the game
incorporating our personal character preferences into the narrative &#150;
namely Vaughn&#146;s choice of a sword over a firearm. Because of this I
suspected we&#146;d come up against neo-Samurai at some point, or even
corporate ninja. </P> <P><P>Mazy was talking, sounding sceptical. &quot;Jules Toba? He&#146;s pretty
much the face of Sensei in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, yeah? He rarely
sets foot outside the corporate arcology, so what&#146;s he doing way out
here?&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta shrugged. &quot;Toba engineered the need for a high-level
conference, one which couldn&#146;t be conducted via a virtual interface. The
plan was for his private jet to develop engine trouble, such that it put
down at Darwin Hub, where an extraction team headed by Turner is
waiting.&quot;  A flicker of annoyance passed over his features and he
took a sip of mineral water before continuing. &quot;Unfortunately, the
sabotage proved to be all too effective and his aircraft could only make
it as far as here, Henderson Field. A spot where neither Sensei nor my
temporary employers have a corporate presence.&quot;</P> <P><P>I could feel the prompt forming in my mind, a bit like an itch you
had to scratch, and moved to pre-empt it. &quot;So you need an
improvised team to spirit him away. Well, forgive me being so blunt, but
won&#146;t his security be a trigger-happy suicide squad? I don&#146;t fancy going
down in the proverbial hail of gunfire.&quot;</P> <P><P>Our potential patron smiled, again. &quot;Sensei decided to keep his
presence here low-key. Obviously security will be on the increase, but
in an unobtrusive manner so as not to alert their commercial rivals. On
landing here Toba and his personal bodyguard were passed off as flight
engineers, part of a test crew, although this deception will not last
for long.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn scratched his nose, almost grinning, so I guessed he&#146;d read
the recent game reviews, complete with spoilers. &quot;Oh, and why not?
What&#146;s happened to blow his cover?&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta sighed. &quot;Sensei made the mistake of booking them into a
better hotel than their pay grade would warrant. Corporate expert
systems are constantly trawling the data stream for anomalies like that,
so it&#146;s only a matter of time before his true identity leaks
out.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;So, what you&#146;re saying is that not only do we have to get Toba
out before his own security congeals around him like amber, we can also
expect to run across other snatch squads as well?&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta sat back and
inspected the fingernails on his right hand, not
looking Vaughn in the face. &quot;Well, no one said this would be easy,
and I think you&#146;ll find the financial pay-off will be commensurate with
the risk. Look, all you have to do is get in, get out and deliver him to
Hangar twelve where an orbital shuttle will be waiting. The original
extraction team will ensure that attention remains focussed on Darwin
Hub. Any rumour of Toba being <I>here</I> will look like disinformation,
and any opposition you might encounter won&#146;t be first-team
quality.&quot;</P> <P><P>I took a swig of beer. &quot;So what&#146;s the catch, Canasta? I can just
hear a real big &#145;but&#146; coming at the end of that spiel.&quot;</P> <P><P>He glowered at me, letting the mask of good humour slip.
&quot;<I>But</I>, Toba doesn&#146;t know you&#146;re coming, and he&#146;s expecting
Turner in person. As a result he may prove somewhat reluctant to
accompany you.&quot;</P> <P><P>Blondie looked at him, wide-eyed. &quot;And what about Deb&#133;the head
of his security detail? Do you know if she&#146;s here yet?&quot; </P> <P><P>Canasta paused before replying, as his persona tried to make sense of
the question in light of the narrative. &quot;His personal bodyguard is
James Graham, a former police officer with extensive experience of close
protection operations. I don&#146;t have any details on who will head up the
extra security that Sensei are sending in. Do you know something I
don&#146;t?&quot;</P> <P><P>Blondie floundered and I knew that the scenario would come down hard
on any sign of inside information. We didn&#146;t need that kind of grief as
the mission was going to be hard enough anyway. So I gave Canasta my
best open smile and let bullshit commence.</P> <P><P>&quot;I&#146;d say that was just deduction, Canasta. Sensei don&#146;t want to
give the game away so they&#146;ll be bringing in extra bodies in the guise
of ground crew, passengers, anything that won&#146;t appear too obvious. The
corporate mindset is geared up to expect a hard-nosed guy as security
chief, so using a woman would be a smart move, a way to wrong-foot the
opposition. She&#146;ll probably prove more deadly than the male,
but that&#146;s our problem.&quot;</P> <P><P>He sat back and I could feel that 'end of chapter' edge to
proceedings. &quot;So you&#146;ll take the job?&quot;</P> <P><P>We looked at each other, if only because the moment demanded it, and
Vaughn raised his bottle in a toast. &quot;Easy in, easy out.&quot;</P> <P><P>We agreed some outrageous sum to be paid into a variety of off-shore
accounts, and Canasta left. The money wasn&#146;t real, although it did give
your virtual persona prestige points, but it was the experience itself
that most players wanted. After exchanging mobile phone numbers I
prompted the group to split up, knowing that to hang around meant
getting caught up in a bar fight, and I wasn&#146;t in the mood.</P> <P><P class=drop>The <I>Inverted Spin</I> was part of a high-tech shanty
town that had
grown up outside the orbital hub, away from the corporate enclaves. The
irritating thing was we&#146;d spend several hours lurking in the backstreets
while Ramirez did his thing &#150; arranging ground transport, a safe house,
weapons
&#150; while all the time I knew Toba was less than a mile away. </P> <P><P>Ramirez needed muscle to back some of his face-to-face transactions
and Vaughn let Mazy take the lead, preferring to kick back and just
chill. I was looking to relax as well - my skills as a pilot wouldn&#146;t be
called upon until much later. The two of us sat on the veranda of a
nearby caf&eacute;, although the heat and humidity was a level of
virtual reality I could well have done without.</P> <P><P><div class=pullquote>In a standard game the experience was lifelike
but you always knew you were in a virtual reality environment</div>I was
expecting a more-or-less pleasant hiatus until my personal
&#145;confront your past&#146; sub-plot kicked in &#150; the one which explained my
bitter, twisted attitude. However, as soon as the others had vanished
into the crowd Vaughn was up and away, with me stepping out to catch up.
He was unusually grim faced and I expected some explanation, but as we
continued walking in silence my patience gave out. &quot;So, Vaughn,
what gives?&quot;</P> <P><P>He glanced at me. &quot;We both know the Sensei crew are holed up in
the Holiday Lodge. It&#146;s a classier setup than the Ascension Hotel and
the only option given what Canasta laid out for us.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Yeah? So what?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Well, how about we walk in there, walk right up to the desk and
ask to speak to Jules Toba. Just take it from there.&quot;</P> <P><P>I pulled up. &quot;Whoa there, Vaughn. You can&#146;t just bounce straight
to the extraction stage. You push the game and it&#146;ll push
back.&quot;</P> <P><P>He kept walking and again I had to hurry to catch up, trying not to
sound irritated. &quot;Come on, Vaughn, what is this? Look, Ramirez does
his stuff and Blondie gets us the hotel layout, hacks their security
system. Then you, Mazy and Harrison go in while the rest of us wait
outside with the engine running.&quot;</P> <P><P>He snorted with derision. &quot;You don&#146;t find that all a bit
convoluted? A bit contrived? Your problem is you think you know what&#146;s
going on, because you&#146;ve played the earlier version. The others, even
fat boy, will roll with the punches but <I>this</I> game is going to
blindside you, man, big time.&quot;</P> <P><P>I frowned and pulled him up, a hand on his shoulder. &quot;OK, so
maybe I skipped the introduction and briefing stages, but this, going
charging straight in there, is well out of order. Or do you really know
something I don&#146;t?&quot;</P> <P><P>He gave me a short smile, barely a twitch of his lips, and shrugged
off my hand. &quot;Let&#146;s just say I&#146;m not quite the character you think
I am, and leave it at that. Now, are you coming or not?&quot;</P> <P><P>Before I could speak another voice answered. &quot;I&#146;ll tag along,
even if he won&#146;t.&quot; Harrison stepped out from between two small vans
parked at the roadside. His character was a jack of all trades, there to
step in should one of the principals drop out. As
such it wasn&#146;t a popular choice, frequently being left as a non-player
persona under game control &#150; and the first to take a bullet if the bad
guys got the drop on us. </P> <P><P>I looked between Harrison and Vaughn, getting the distinct feeling I
was missing something. &quot;Look, Harrison, shouldn&#146;t you be hanging
with Ramirez and Mazy? Or at least babysitting Blondie? If anyone screws
up we&#146;re counting on you to take up the slack.&quot;</P> <P><P>He removed his hat and wiped sweat from the head band. &quot;That&#146;s a
bit predictable, if you don&#146;t mind me saying. The longer we hang about
the tougher it&#146;s gonna be to reach Toba, so I think Vaughn
here has a point. We go knock on his door and see if he
answers.&quot;</P> <P><P>This casual flaunting of scenario protocols was starting to make me
nervous. &quot;Look guys, even if by some miracle we pull this off,
we&#146;re cutting three players out of the action. If nothing else that&#146;s
gonna <I>seriously</I> hurt our game rankings. Nobody likes a dickhead
who messes things up for everyone else.&quot;</P> <P><P>Harrison laughed. &quot;<I>Told</I> you he was a bit pedestrian,
Vaughn. You still say he&#146;s worth having around?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Duncan is solid. He just needs time to adjust
to the new UR paradigm shift.&quot;</P> <P><P>I wasn&#146;t a great fan of Ultra-Realism, but I&#146;d gone with the
interface upgrade as I&#146;m a bit of a techno-nerd at heart. Whereas
existing games were more real than real in terms of the simulated
sensory input hitting your brain, the new versions from
Second&nbsp;Reality&#8482; made me decidedly uncomfortable. </P> <P><P>In a standard game the experience was lifelike but you always
<I>knew</I> you were in a virtual reality environment. For example:
coffee tasted like coffee, things didn&#146;t break down unless they were
supposed to, it didn&#146;t rain on your parade. UR was far more subtle, it
was all about nuances, both physical and psychological. Now the coffee
might taste like crap, a button might come off your jacket, you might
get a toothache. It was really hard to tell you were in a UR
environment, and that&#146;s what many industry commentators found
unsettling. However, I could see this particular &#145;full sensory immersion
experience&#146; going down the toilet in short order.</P> <P><P>&quot;Look, guys, what do you hope to achieve? It doesn&#146;t matter how
flexible the scenario may be, you simply can&#146;t play this fast and loose
with the narrative and expect to get away scot-free.&quot;</P> <P><P>The two of them exchanged glances and, again, I felt like an
outsider. Vaughn opened his coat, exposing the wakizashi hanging under
there. &quot;Take a look at my sword, Duncan. A real close look, at the
very end of the hilt.&quot;</P> <P><P>Curious, I stepped closer and tilted it towards me. &quot;Well,
there&#146;s a symbol-&quot;</P> <P><P>Fade to grey.</P> <P><P class=drop>It lasted a moment, an eternity, or something in-between.
A
featureless limbo, with not even darkness to feed my imagination. There
was no up, no down, no sense of physical presence &#150; I was just a
disembodied point of view, with nothing to see.</P> <P><P>The street returned on a tidal wave of sensory overload and I stepped
back, hunched over against the onslaught, unable to speak. Vaughn let
his coat fall back into place, covering the sword. There was concern in
Harrison&#146;s voice but I didn&#146;t think it was for my condition. &quot;Best
get him off the street, we&#146;re attracting attention.&quot;</P> <P><P>They guided me into a narrow alley and I stood with my back against
the wall, eyes screwed shut, fingers in my ears. My surroundings were
still too loud, too pungent, too bright.</P> <P><P>&quot;What you do to him, Vaughn? The guy is totally wired.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Duncan has the same Sensorium interface that most established
AIs use &#150; their window on our world, if you like. When mediaCore
announced they were adapting it for use in the gaming community he
decided to get in on the ground level. Beta release wetware, extensive
neural hardwiring, the whole nine yards. Then, of course, along came
Enhanced Reality which left its competitors dead in the water. It became
the de facto gaming standard and he was forced to tack on another layer
of proprietary hardware, as did all serious players.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;So your boy is wandering around in the real world with a head
full of obsolete technology. Big deal. How did that allow you to work
your mojo on him <I>in here</I>?&quot;</P> <P><P>I could hear something in Vaughn&#146;s voice; not satisfaction exactly,
more a sense of relief. &quot;AIs play games, AIs
play a <I>lot</I> of games. For some, it&#146;s the only time they get let out
of the box. So they have the ER, and now UR, interface as well. This
symbol on my sword hilt is a glyph, an interface command
trigger.&quot;</P> <P><P>Harrison was beginning to sound irritated. &quot;In English?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;It activates the old Sensorium interface, which this game
environment doesn&#146;t support. It&#146;s like switching to a dead TV channel &#150;
there&#146;s no signal, only static.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;And this helps us how, exactly?&quot;</P> <P><P>Cooking smells reached my nose and my stomach turned over; I turned
away and threw up. Harrison laughed. &quot;Jesus, Vaughn! Your boy is
dying out here.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn put his hand on my shoulder and the pressure made my shirt
feel like sandpaper. &quot;Easy there, Duncan, it&#146;s just the shock of a
sensory reboot. Try and concentrate on your own body to start with &#133; And
to answer your question, Harrison, this little gizmo, incorporated into
my sword, means that if I stick an AI player it&#146;ll force a log out. That
way we avoid any so-called last gasp retaliation and the character
lapses into a non-player persona. That is, a dead person.&quot;</P> <P><P>Harrison laughed again. &quot;Yeah, I get that. Those AIs sure make
sore losers. Couldn&#146;t you just have <I>told</I> us though, as opposed to
putting bozo here through the wringer?&quot;</P> <P><P>I spat and straightened up. &quot;Bastard! What the hell was all that
about?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn just shrugged with no hint of apology in his voice. &quot;Had
to see if it worked. I&#146;ve learned that some of the principal characters
are likely to be AIs with genuine synthetic personalities, not just an
emotional overlay. Prime candidates for holding a grudge should we get a
bit creative.&quot;</P> <P><P>I wasn&#146;t pleased. &quot;Just the type to get vindictive, you mean!
And you still want us to go marching straight in there? Well, think
again.&quot;</P> <P><P>Even Harrison was beginning to sound doubtful. &quot;Yeah, hold on
there, Vaughn. Your fancy blade might not be illegal, strictly speaking,
but you can bet the <I>game</I> AI won&#146;t take kindly to one of his kind
being shown the door in short order. We don&#146;t need any unnecessary grief
if you ask me.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shook his head. &quot;No, this new version is a true free-form
environment. As gamers we know where Toba will be, because we know the
original version, right? As characters we can use logical deduction to
explain away this knowledge, and the game won&#146;t punish us for being
smart. I say we give it a go.&quot;</P> <P><P>Harrison and I exchanged glances and I could tell he was swaying
towards the high risk strategy his devil-may-care persona always
favoured.  I trusted Vaughn, more or less, so there had to be something
behind his confidence, something he hadn&#146;t shared as yet. I shrugged.
&quot;What&#146;s the worst that can happen?&quot;</P> <P><P>Harrison grinned. &quot;I&#146;ll hang back while you two stick your heads
in the grinder, if you don&#146;t mind. If it doesn&#146;t work out I&#146;ll break the
bad news to the others and we&#146;ll go back to the original plan.&quot;</P> <P><P>I snorted. &quot;You can pilot a shuttle? Handle a weapon?&quot;</P> <P><P>He spread his hands. &quot;I&#146;m pretty much a renaissance man when you
get down to it. I can do a whole <I>range</I> of things equally unwell.
But
enough to get by.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn just laughed and led us back onto the street. It wasn&#146;t that
far to the hotel but I insisted we at least try and maximize our chances
before walking in there. The other two refused to change, so as front man
by default I swopped my jeans and vest for a lightweight business suit
and open-necked shirt. With the facial scars I looked like a corporate
enforcer and the tailor even threw in an eye patch for free.  </P> <P><P>Whereas Harrison had roguish good looks and Vaughn went for brooding,
the man looking back at me from the full length mirror was just
<I>mean</I>. Not even with a hint of moody, but full-blown bad bastard.
They say chicks dig scars but mine verged on disfigurement, and women
attracted to me for my looks always turned out to be seriously damaged
personalities. I&#146;d stopped modifying my appearance long before the new
UR interface started placing a premium on physical dissonance, but I
suspected most other players thought I looked this way for effect.</P> <P><P>To round off my new look I went for diamond stud cufflinks and a pair
of matching gold thumb rings previously owned by a Brazilian
<I>capoeira</I> fighter. The game loved touches like that and I was sure
any AI player would pick up on it immediately. I figured the
anticipation of a fancy move might make an opponent hesitate, giving me
the chance to grab an improvised weapon or make a sharp exit.</P> <P><P>When I came out Vaughn just shook his head and Harrison sniggered,
but I noticed that the pedestrians we encountered went out of their way
to give us a wide berth. Outside the Holiday Lodge we parted company;
Harrison took up residence under a bar umbrella across the street and
Vaughn waited outside in case someone objected to his esoteric dress
sense. He handed me an earpiece and I went inside. </P> <P><P class=drop>The Holiday Lodge was a comparatively new building with a
nod towards
colonial chic; high ceilings, tiled floors, concrete trying to look like
marble. I walked across the wide reception-cum-lounge to the desk, where
an Indonesian dude gave me an insincere smile. &quot;Good afternoon,
sir. How may I help you?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;I understand you have a party from Sensei Industries staying
here at present. I&#146;d like to speak to them.&quot;</P> <P><P>There was a slight hesitation, but the game couldn&#146;t just blank a
legitimate request. The receptionist lifted a handset. &quot;Certainly
sir, and who shall I say is calling?&quot;</P> <P><P>A sudden idea came to me and I smiled. &quot;Jules Toba.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn laughed in my ear. <I>&quot;Jesus! Well, that should grab
their attention, and no mistake. What you got planned as an
encore?&quot;</P> </I> <P>There was a murmur of conversation on the
phone and then the receptionist looked up. &quot;There will be someone
to see you directly, Mr Toba. If you care to wait in the veranda bar,
I&#146;ll inform our guests where you are.&quot; </P> <P><P>I wandered through the wide arch into the bar, which opened out onto
the veranda via a set of folding doors. A climate barrier kept out most
of the heat and humidity so I flopped down on the upholstered bamboo
furniture to let things play out.</P> <P><P>Vaughn mooched in and relaxed; arms wide across the back of the sofa,
legs stretched out, crossed at the ankles. I saw Harrison take a seat
outside, trying to remain inconspicuous. He&#146;d swopped the hat and
waistcoat for improvised cravat and shades, but still had his shoulder
bag to hand. We ordered a bottle of beer for Vaughn and a tonic water
for me. And waited. </P> <P><P>&quot;Do you actually have a plan, Vaughn, or is this all just
wishful thinking?&quot;</P> <P><P>He smiled. &quot;Wishful thinking? I&#146;d prefer to think of it as an
insightful analysis of the game paradigms. Or just winging it, your
choice&#133; You armed, by the way?</P> <P><P>&quot;Me? My character has a pathological aversion to firearms
following my wife&#146;s suicide using my service revolver. I was supposed to
run into an old girlfriend and save her from a mugging, during which I&#146;d
reconnect to my suppressed humanity and love of bang-sticks, but
<I>someone</I> has kind of truncated my day.&quot;  </P> <P><P>Vaughn started to laugh but then his face went carefully neutral and
he gestured with the beer bottle. &quot;We&#146;ve got company.&quot;</P> <P><P>Three men entered from the lobby, two Japanese and one Caucasian, all
wearing short-sleeved shirts and flight crew uniform jackets. They wore
their jackets unbuttoned and the way the younger Japanese guy kept
tugging his shut over a bulge suggested firearms carried at the hip.
Professionals you can trust, but hastily armed civilians can be a right
pain in the butt. The best I could do was play it cool, professional,
and hope for inspiration. I stood and exchanged formal bows with the
older Japanese, who was wearing captain&#146;s insignia. Vaughn remained
seated, a calculated insult, and I felt the tension rise. So much for
cool.  </P> <P><P>&quot;I am Captain Marasaki, senior test pilot for Sensei Industries.
This is co-pilot Walker, flight engineer Sato. You are not Jules
Toba.&quot;</P> <P><P>Marasaki was no more a test pilot than I was Coco the Clown. Real
test pilots are either dispassionate ice men or over-confident wild
animals with <I>cojones</I> the size of basketballs. This guy exuded a
sober calm based on years of experience, just the person you wanted
flying senior executives around the globe. </P> <P><P>Before I could say anything Vaughn chipped in. &quot;No he&#146;s not. But
we both know the real Jules Toba is here, and your enemies will soon
learn of this unless we act quickly.&quot;</P> <P><P>Marasaki regarded him coldly. &quot;And you are?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn set down his beer and stood up. &quot;Vaughn Vermeer, and this
is Duncan Bonn. U verwachtte iemand, maar u verwachtte niet om ons te
zien, niet waar?"</P> <P><P>That threw me completely but the pilot seemed to understand him well
enough. &quot;Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn nodded. &quot;Ja, maar gelieve verder te gaan in het
Engels.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;As you wish, Mr Vermeer. You have something, perhaps, that you
wish to show me?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn held his coat open and I saw Marasaki scrutinise the sword.
The Captain gave a sharp nod and Vaughn closed his coat, looking
slightly smug. I really didn&#146;t get this, to the point where I was
feeling embarrassed about my ignorance. Vaughn motioned to Harrison who
strode in, all easy grin, pocketing his sunglasses. He didn&#146;t rate a
formal introduction but didn&#146;t seem to mind. Captain Marasaki motioned
for us to accompany him. &quot;Please, gentlemen. If the situation is as
serious as you claim then speed is of the essence.&quot;</P> <P><P>We moved in a mixed group back into the lobby and I sidled up to
Harrison, keeping my voice low. &quot;What&#146;s this Dutch angle,
then?&quot;</P> <P><P>He glanced at me, frowning. &quot;Dutch? You mean NuVOC? It&#146;s who
Vaughn and I both worked for before he retired and I branched out into
private enterprise. Don&#146;t you know <I>anything</I> about the new
background to this game?&quot;</P> <P><P>I felt my face colour and tried to keep the tone flippant.
&quot;Maybe I skimmed the briefing notes a bit. Just say that today has
been a learning curve and leave it at that.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Schmuck.&quot;</P> <P><P>Couldn&#146;t fault him there. </P> <P><P>The front of the Holiday Lodge was a wide fa&ccedil;ade, housing
reception, a restaurant and the bar. The accommodation to the rear was a
series of bungalows around a central tree-filled courtyard. This
afforded shade, the pleasant background rustle of leaves and a degree of
privacy from the guests directly opposite. As we reached the long
right-hand path the flight crew stopped and Marasaki gestured for us to
continue.</P> <P><P>&quot;Please, you are expected. And may fortune smile upon you,
gentlemen.&quot;</P> <P><P>We walked on and I saw there was a woman waiting for us outside a
bungalow roughly half way along. Shoulder length blonde hair, pencil
skirt, blouse, heels, hand on hip.</P> <P><P>It was Debbie Harry, it just <I>was</I>.</P> <P><P>I&#146;m not a fan of simulated celebrities in
games as they&#146;re generally
there to distract you from shoddy gameplay. For the late, great, Ms
Harry, though &#150; currently back in the charts and on virtual tour &#150; well,
I was willing to make an exception.</P> <P><P>She certainly looked the part, all detached cool circa &#145;Def, Dumb,
&amp; Blonde&#146;, with a calculating air that shaded her into queen bitch
territory. She didn&#146;t appear armed but I got the distinct impression she
probably didn&#146;t need anything as crass as a gun.</P> <P><P>Vaughn walked straight up to her, slid an arm around her waist, and
kissed her. Kissed her for a long time. She didn&#146;t melt into his arms
but, then again, she didn&#146;t exactly fight him off either. Finally he
broke the clinch and wiped her lipstick from his face.</P> <P><P>&quot;Debs, it&#146;s been too long.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;That will be <I>Miss</I> Harry, if you don&#146;t mind.&quot;</P> <P><P>She gave him a half smile, though, and he winked. &quot;In
here?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Yes. Go right in, you&#146;re expected.&quot;</P> <P><P>I followed Vaughn into the bungalow, trying not to catch her eye. The
blinds were drawn and it took a moment for my eyes to adjust from the
outside glare. There was a man sitting at the desk off to the right,
reading. He was of average build, pretty nondescript, and seemingly
unconcerned by our presence. I heard the door close behind me. I heard
the sound of a gun being cocked.</P> <P><P class=drop>The Second&nbsp;Reality&#8482; slogan is &#145;Your life, only
different&#146;,
and that&#146;s the
attraction. You bring yourself to the game and in return it immerses you
in an alternative lifestyle. So when I heard that slick metallic
<I>click</I> my first thought was &#145;Oh shit&#146;, not &#145;I&#146;m out of here&#146;.
Vaughn and I both raised our hands, unbidden, and I slowly turned back
towards the door. I was expecting it to be Harrison, tag-along Harrison,
on some betrayal sub-plot.</P> <P><P><div class=lpullquote>If you&#146;ve played as many games as I have, you
start to get a sense of a twist coming.</div> Instead I found he was
also standing, hands raised, with an automatic
pistol pressed against the side of his head. The gunman was tall, with
short grey hair and goatee, expensive suit, hard-faced. He&#146;d been hiding
behind the door, which was just too obvious to be true, but had paid off
handsomely. He had a Scots accent.</P> <P><P>&quot;In this room I have sole responsibility for the safety of Mr
Toba. You have five seconds to explain your presence here and I don&#146;t
count out loud.&quot;</P> <P><P>I saw Harrison relax and expected Vaughn to launch into another
incomprehensible spiel, or display that damn sword, or do whatever was
required to make us all best buddies.  But there was nothing apart from
the sound of a heavy-bladed ceiling fan above us. </P> <P><P>Harrison cleared his throat. &quot;Vaughn? Hey, Vaughn&#133;&quot;</P> <P><P>The game went slo-mo.</P>
<P>The muzzle flash, starshell bright in the gloom.</P>
<P>The jolt of the head, jaw slack and eyes white.</P>
<P>The exit wound arc of blood, bone and brain matter.</P>
<P>The tumbling glitter of an ejected shell casing.</P>
<P>All underscored by the low, drawn-out roar of a large caliber gunshot.</P> <P><P>Real-time returned, with the bright tinkle of brass on tile. Harrison
toppled sideways to sprawl on the floor, blood pooling under his
head.</P> <P><P>Blood ran down the gunman&#146;s cheek.</P>
<P>Blood ran down the gunman&#146;s cheek from his ruined left eye.</P> <P><P>I turned my head and saw Vaughn was holding a derringer; a small
weapon, little more than a toy. One of those comedy guns that slide out
from your cuff, but nobody was laughing. I looked back. The gunman
swayed but stayed upright, pistol turning towards us. I heard a tinny
<I>bang</I> from behind me and his right eye seemed to collapse in on
itself, like those old style retractable headlights. The swinging arm
became a pirouette, became a twisting tumble to the floor, on his back,
gun still clenched tight. I laughed, a nervous outburst devoid of any
humour, and lowered my arms. </P> <P><P>The man at the desk spoke; his voice was calm, mannered, with no hint
of concern. &quot;Now, that <I>is</I> unfortunate. Mr Graham was
exceptionally loyal, after his fashion.&quot;</P> <P><P>I turned in time to see Vaughn flex his hand and make the derringer
vanish. He looked over. &quot;Jules Toba? I just like to be clear about
these things.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Well, it would be embarrassing if I turned out anyone else but,
yes, I&#146;m Jules Toba. Should I bother to ask why you&#146;re here or is this a
simple corporate assassination?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn smiled. &quot;I&#146;m Vermeer, this is Bonn, and we&#146;ve been hired
to facilitate your defection from Sensei Industries.&quot;</P> <P><P>Toba arched one eyebrow. &quot;Really? And why do you think I would
so easily set aside a lifetime of devoted service?&quot;</P> <P><P>I knew we didn&#146;t have time for Toba to play coy, even though it was
obvious Miss Harry was working with Vaughn, and chipped in. &quot;Look,
Mr Toba, we know you were expecting Turner, but this is pretty much an
ad hoc operation and your best chance of making that long walk. How
about you just trust us and we all ride off into the sunset?&quot;</P> <P><P>Even as I spoke I could feel the niggle in back of my mind. If you&#146;ve
played as many games as I have, you start to get a sense of a twist
coming. Vaughn turned to me. &quot;It&#146;s OK, Duncan, but I&#146;m afraid Mr
Toba wasn&#146;t planning on defecting.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;What?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;There&#146;s no defection, there never was. Oh, there will be enough
circumstantial evidence to make it <I>appear</I> as if he was planning
to switch employers, but its all just window dressing.&quot;</P> <P><P>I glared at him. &quot;So what the hell are we doing here then?
Getting his autograph?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;The plan was for the Sensei security team, headed by Miss
Harry, to be in place long before we mounted our extraction bid. They&#146;d
been bribed to ensure that Mr Toba died in the crossfire &#150; a tragic
accident. Harrison was also part of their operation, as insurance.&quot;
He turned to Toba, &quot;You appreciate, sir, the damage your death
would cause under these circumstances?&quot;</P> <P><P>Toba nodded. &quot;Yes, quite. Even the suggestion of disloyalty
would cast a pall over my colleagues and call all recent decisions into
doubt. The blow to investor confidence would be severe. But how, may I
ask, are you privy to this information?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Miss Harry, sir, remained loyal. She contacted Anzai Sayoru,
the head of Sensei security. As they had no way of knowing who else
might be involved, it was decided to let the plot develop, but with
additional safeguards in place.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Meaning yourself, Mr Vermeer?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn inclined his head. &quot;Indeed. I am an agent of the New
Dutch East India Company, NuVOC. Officially I retired from active
service some years ago, but that&#146;s more to do with deniability than any
real degree of severance. There is a long history of cooperation between
our respective employers and we were glad to be of assistance.&quot;</P> <P><P>OK, I could get behind that. You can&#146;t trust your own security so you
bring in some outside help. Not so much an extraction as rescue mission,
but I could see how the twist kept most of the scenario intact. Toba,
though, still wasn&#146;t convinced. He tidied a few things on the desk and
casually lifted a pistol from the drawer. &quot;An intriguing scenario,
Mr Vermeer, I must admit. But one quite lacking in corroborative
evidence. All I have witnessed is that Miss Harry allowed you access to
this bungalow, and two violent deaths.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn gestured to his coat. &quot;May I?&quot;</P> <P><P>Toba nodded and Vaughn drew his sword, holding it by tip and hilt. He
presented it for inspection, bowing his head as he did so.
&quot;Satisfied?&quot;</P> <P><P>Toba lowered his gun. &quot;Quite. Now, as regards Miss Harry, I
suggest-&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn stabbed him, a twisting, inverted, one-handed blow straight to
the stomach, hilt deep. I choked with surprise, turned away and dropped
to my knees, scrabbling through Harrison&#146;s bag to get the antique
revolver I knew he&#146;d been carrying. </P> <P><P>There was no need.</P> <P><P>Toba stood there, immobile, the gun still hanging at his side. Vaughn
had backed off a little and I had a clear view of the injury he&#146;d
inflicted. There was no blood, but around the entry point it looked like
the colour was leaching out of Toba&#146;s clothes, leaving a spreading patch
of monochrome. I struggled to my feet, the revolver heavy in my
hand.</P> <P><P>&quot;Vaughn? What the hell have you done, man?&quot;</P> <P><P>He shrugged. &quot;I did what I had to. Now give me the gun, I&#146;m
better with firearms than you are.&quot; </P> <P><P>&quot;But, but, <I>why</I>, for God&#146;s sake? I was following
everything and then you go and slice him!&quot;</P> <P><P>His shoulders drooped. &quot;I tried to tell you earlier. They really
are holding my daughter hostage. Now, give me the gun.&quot;</P> <P><P>I was floundering, unable to get my thoughts straight, and took a
step back. &quot;Real world? The game? I don&#146;t understand!&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Duncan, <I>give me the damn gun!</I>&quot;</P> <P><P>He grabbed for it and I fired, three times, hitting Vaughn twice in
the chest. He dropped to his knees, pink froth on his lips, and tried to
speak. All that came out was a burbling whisper.
<I>&quot;Lisbon.&quot;</P> </I>  <P><P>Vaughn slumped backwards to the
floor, and was still. I know he wasn&#146;t really dead, I know I didn&#146;t
really kill him, but unless you were there you&#146;ve no idea of the horror
I faced. Gun smoke, the smell of blood and bowels, the sight of blood
running between the floor tiles, the pounding of my heart. All in
glorious Ultra-Reality. I felt sick.</P> <P><P>The door behind me opened and closed. I sensed someone at my shoulder
and the smell of jasmine reached my nostrils. &quot;Messy, but probably
necessary, if truth be told. That revolver is of no further use to you,
Duncan.&quot;</P> <P><P>I let it clatter to the floor and blinked rapidly, my eyes moist.
Toba was turning black and white, skin as well as clothes, like an
illustration being coloured in, but in reverse.</P> <P><P>&quot;What, what <I>is</I> that?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry tried to sound matter-of-fact, even slightly bored, but
there was an underlying edge of excitement to her voice. &quot;The sword
is an imported artifact, not supplied by me. Players do it all the time
with customised clothes, vehicles, especially weapons. This
<I>particular</I> weapon, this <I>particular</I> representation of
virtual code, contains a virus. One that can access its intended target
only though the obsolete Sensorium interface. As such, it&#146;s harmless to
humans and doesn&#146;t even register as a threat within the game.&quot;</P> <P><P> &quot;You, you&#146;re the game controller? But you can&#146;t <I>do</I> this,
it&#146;s not fair!&quot;</P> <P><P>She gave me a real poster pose, all coquettish pout. &quot;What, a
girl can&#146;t have fun these days? Anyway, as regards our stricken friend
over there, his real name is Cromarty. Well, that&#146;s the corporation he
works for, but the two are frequently synonymous these days. Someone
went to a lot of trouble over this.&quot;</P> <P><P>This wasn&#146;t so much breaking the &#145;fourth wall&#146; as installing a set of
sliding doors. I closed my eyes but there was still no &#145;Exit Game&#146; icon,
no way home. There was a contemplative tone in her voice.</P> <P><P>&quot;Let every voice be still.&quot;</P> <P><P>I blinked, picking up something in her intonation. &quot;What?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;It&#146;s part of a poem by Holbein. <I>Let every voice be still,
save false witness to the end of days</I>. It&#146;s a commentary on how
events can be redefined, restructured to suit a particular viewpoint,
particularly when there are no dissenting voices.&quot;</P> <P><P>I felt cold. &quot;Dissenting voices? Like mine?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry laughed, sounding genuinely amused. &quot;Good grief, no!
You get to play the sole survivor of this little bloodbath, not me. Its
now part and parcel of the scenario and I&#146;m just a compromised operative
on the run, a fellow traveler. In fact, we have to rejoin the remaining
players for the &#145;all avenues closed&#146; endgame. It promises to be quite
exciting and I understand there&#146;s someone desperately keen to make my
acquaintance&#133;Time to go.&quot;</P> <P><P>I hesitated, unable to tear my eyes away. &quot;This isn&#146;t a game
any more, is it?&quot;</P> <P><P>She patted my shoulder. &quot;It never was, Duncan. It never was.&quot;</P> <P><P> <P><i>If, like Duncan Bonn, you're still looking for answers, then his
confusion will be addressed in <a href="http://mythaxis.co.uk/3issuev10.htm" target=_blank>'All Avenues Closed'</a> -
