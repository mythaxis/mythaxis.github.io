<div align=center><img src="slippage.jpg"><BR><h2>Slippage</h2><BR><h3>Les Sklaroff</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>There's: Truths, Half-Truths, Lies and... Slippage</i>
<p class="drop">For much of the last century the property,
a basement in the Bloomsbury
area, had belonged to Cyril Garring-Pugh, a reclusive minor aristocrat
with sufficient funds to indulge his relatively few interests,
principally fine wines, good books and compliant women.  In his later
years he became obsessed by elf-lore, and spent much of his time
studying runes, and, it was rumoured, conducting curious experiments.
Now deceased, the owner had no close family.  The odd manner of his
death had been the cause of some speculation, and according to reports,
the police were keeping their files open - which meant closed to
investigative journalists.  The cellar was long depleted, the women
vanished into the night.  All that remained were the books, which Milner
(as he currently prefers to be known), with his impeccable credentials
(and his own unique private library), had been asked to examine on
behalf of the executors.  They made no objection when he asked if I, as
his most recent amanuensis, might accompany him. <P><div class=pullquote>Wasn't a printer's devil some sort of
apprentice?</div>A thin layer of dust had settled on every surface, but
fortunately the
ventilation system had kept the books dry and free from mould.  Milner
glanced again at the book I'd handed him with a wry smile - the first
one that had caught my eye: a copy, according to the title on the spine,
of <b><i>Leak House</i></b> by Dickens.   "I'd say, young Arnold,  that
this
may well be a typical example of a printer's devil at work.  You do
realise that the lost 'B' is not a sign of wear," he said earnestly,   
angling the book so that I could see the title-page. <b>LEAK HOUSE</b>
it stated again, unmistakably, in large clear capitals.  There was no
trace of erasure.  <P>My smile faded.  "That's very peculiar" I said.  "But
wasn't a printer's devil some sort of apprentice?" <P>"A common misconception, dating back to the seventeenth century,"
Milner replied.  "At the very least, this is symptomatic of mischievous
slippage.  No, my friend, it looks as though Garring-Pugh must have
given serious offence, however inadvertently, to the elvish
community, and the consequences, as I have reason to know, can be rather
unfortunate.  I fear this entire collection may have suffered.  I
suggest we try selecting a few more at random." <P>He crossed the room, and with remarkable suppleness for a man of his
considerable age reached up to a shelf above his head, and took down a
book.  It was an English translation of Flaubert's <b><i>Madame
Ovary</i></b>.
"Dear me," said Milner, "A trifle indelicate, wouldn't you say?  Try
choosing one at random."  I looked around.  In a small bookcase there
were some elderly-looking children's books.   <P>I picked out one with a
dark red binding.  "<b><i>Lice in Wonderland</i></b>," I called out,
disbelievingly.  <P>"Most unpleasant," said Milner, reaching for another.
"Here's <b><i>The Tim Machine</i></b>." <P>"Now there's a coincidence," I said,
spotting a petulant-sounding title by Aldous Huxley: <b><i>Tim Must Have
a
Top</i></b>. <P>"Typical elf-meddling," mused Milner.  "And also an example of
double slippage. Definitely mischievous, bordering on the
disrespectful." <P>We took turns, calling out the titles as we found them.  Wherever we
looked, irreverent slippage had occurred:  <b><i>The Heat of Midlothian
-
Three Men in a Boa - Put Out More Fags - Our Ma in Havana</i></b>.
Clear
indication, as I was now persuaded, of the work of seriously offended
elves. <P>"Can anything be done about this?" I asked Milner, replacing a copy of
<b><i>Wok Suspended</i></b> between <b><i>A Midsummer Night's
Dram</i></b> and
Poe's
<b><i>Ales of Mystery and Imagination</i></b>. <P>He stroked his stylishly
shortened beard. "As it happens," he said, delving into a pocket,
"Knowing Garring-Pugh's reputation, I took the precaution of bringing
with me a specific remedy. You won't find it in the shops; it's a
formula I prepared many years ago for Tom James, a young librarian in
Oxford." He withdrew a small blue glass phial, and gently levered off
its cork stopper with his thumb. Immediately I could smell beeswax and
linseed oil, and something else cloyingly sweet, which I was unable to
identify. Milner then moved in front of each set of shelves, waving the
phial in a sinuous motion from top to bottom, murmuring something
quietly to himself as he did so. "There, that should do the trick," he
said, replacing the stopper, and carefully restoring the phial to his
pocket. "It will probably take full effect in a day or so.  I'll arrange
for us to come back later in the week."   He wandered into the adjoining
room. <P>Moments later I heard a suppressed groan, and rushed through to join
him.  He was peering at an elegant rosewood cabinet.  "Oh dear, Arnold,
I wonder what Cyril did to piss them off?"  Milner rather enjoyed
keeping up with modern idioms. "They didn't stop at the books.  Do you
remember that rather good American TV series? There's a complete boxed
set of DVDs here."   <P>"Which one?" I enquired. <P>He sighed, and reached
again for his little phial.  "See for yourself."   <P>I looked.  Aaron
Sorkin would not have been pleased.  There was a neat row of seven
successively numbered transparent plastic boxes, each one afflicted with
double slippage, rudely labelled: <b><i>The Wet Wig</i></b>. <P><small>&copy; L. J. Sklaroff 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
