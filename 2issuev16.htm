<div><i>"A necessary monster." <small> Jorge Luis Borges</small></i>
<p class="drop">"Who follows me?" called the virgin,
without fear. <P>"I, sweet thing," murmured the wyrm, unseen, its voice made silken with
deceits. <P>"I only feed men, and clean their things," she replied with a dismissive
air and continued on her way towards her village in the cove, where
fishing boats sailed out at dawn and dusk, like now. <P>"There are more hungers than one, maiden." It used her Greek, though any
tongue of men was its to command. It used the flattering word, for
virgins fear that truth at times. <P>"You want my sister's service." She glanced back with a smile, seeing
no-one. To the north the soldiers' camp was become only shadows, upon a
beach of tan sands greening with the growing dark, against a sea of
purple, beneath a dying ember sky. <P>
Her dark eyes reflected it all. The wyrm's reflected only her. <P>"Can she be as lovely?" The girl flushed at the flattery, but did not
pause again. "I ask truly, though I have eyes for no beauty but your
own." <P>"Quite lovely enough for a soldier's relief, which you would not find
with me. She is quick to share, and generous with her time. My price
would be a life's length-" the wyrm grinned, though she did not know it
"-and soon-dead men are not rich enough in years for me." <P>"No man am I," said the wyrm in its true voice, and approached as she
faltered, transfixed. <P><p class=drop>The virgin lay restless in the wyrm's stomach. The great
beast twisted and coiled on its hoard, unable to settle, much like its
meal. It rolled onto its back, undulous like a river, baring its belly
as the mystic heat of the virgin's untapped loins stoked its own fire. <P>It would need that soon. Not a needing like the compulsion which had led
it to consume her, fiery though that was, but the more literal
necessity. <P>It would need flame, as those seeking vengeance inevitably followed a
meal. <P>In this era, with humans abound on every inch of the world like fleas on
a rat's back, wyrmkind had been driven into only the most secluded
places. Now, instead of roosting atop some fine crag beneath the sky,
the wyrm dwelt in caverns by the surface, a shallow seep-water pool to
reflect its treasures before snaking its way on to the sea. It had
become as a tapeworm in that same rat's starving gut.<div
class=pullquote>It was mankind's fancy that virginity's sole value was
in its taking</div> <P>The wyrm seethed. Forced by mankind's ever increasing numbers to hide,
then by hunger to emerge and risk its precious skin. Forced to claim its
sacrifices, not simply receive them from cowering crowds. Forced to
provoke futile pursuits by little mobs - its seething became edged with
satisfaction - who in turn were forced to breach its narrow passages by
lonely ones and twos, no match for the wyrm without scrabbling
multitudes at their back. <P>Two types predominated, as it perceived them. First, those who revenged
themselves out of love (or so they told themselves, though the
feverishness with which each man gripped his weapon was suggestive more
of base lust). Second, those who sought revenge out of duty (or so they
told themselves, for duty done at a king's command is more properly
termed <i>obedience</i>). <P>The wyrm knew of human fancies and deceits, all the more powerful for
being directed solely at themselves. Bravery was the self-deceit of the
dutiful. In mounted ranks, King Louis' dragoons had come, but
the rolling eyes and anxious stamping of their steeds gave lie to the
deeper fear possessing each rider. It was communicated with every
movement of their bodies, beyond the reach of lying tongues to deny, and
their horses heard the message well. <P>But Louis' people heard his fear too, and no denial ever held back the
guillotine's bite. <P>And fancies-it was mankind's fancy that virginity's sole value was in
its taking, fools that they were. Even its bearers only preserved it
with that purpose in mind, aside from the greater fools who sacrificed
their true nature kneeling, knees tight together, at one altar or
another. <P>What did any of them know of the enduring virgin's power? Urgency
preserved, building, overwhelming. An unquenchable fire, kept ever
thirsty for the slaking? They knew nothing. <P>The wyrm's own loins were cold as gold. Only when the fire of its breath
was extinguished would its sexuality begin to burn, fuelling the need to
seek out another fading serpent with which to mate, lay eggs with and,
ultimately, expire beside, young nestling in their coils. <P>Yet as long as there were virginal fonts to sup from, the wyrm pledged
it would maintain its fire. Not for it the civil choice, to quietly age
and sire a fading future. It would roar, and live it. <P><p class=drop>Finally, from the seaward passage came at last the sound
of men approaching, the overlaying echoes of faltering footsteps hinting
at a dutiful mass-but, as their source neared, the echoes synchronised
into that of only one man. <P>The wyrm watched as he limped into the cavern, his military dress
slovenly and stained, hair lank across a handsome, no doubt lustful
brow. <P>"There must be fever in my blood," the visitor said, "for there is a
dragon in my eyes." <P>"I am no fever dream," said the wyrm, in its clicking, cracking speech. <P>"Both, then," he replied, "for I am more unwell than wine has ever made
me." <P>"You are come to avenge my prey, the virgin." Heat flooded the wyrm,
rising like liquor in its veins and throat. It shone beneath its skin,
within its eyes, behind its teeth. <P>"Virgins no longer drive me." The man sneered as he stepped forward, his
eyes swimming in their sockets. The wyrm's glow made him radiant. "I
seek experience, not the lack of it." <P>The creature paused, its endless memory pricked. It knew of human arts
and letters. It knew the vain and petty poem. The old story had
presented the perfect form of the lustful revenger. Not the preening
lord's version, though. He recast the plunderer <i>Don Juan</i> in the
wyrm's new role: sought after, not the seeker. <P>"I know your way with words," the wyrm said, scarcely believing the
evident truth. "You are the poet." <P>The man shook his head. "I am a soldier, come to throw the cursed
Ottomans from out of noble Greece." He drew a sword from his belt sash
with a flourish, swayed a moment, and stabbed the blade into the cavern
floor for balance. "Though I may never have the chance to shed blood for
her. My doctors seek to bleed me dry before battle is even joined."<div
class=lpullquote>"And what poor brew will quench your appetites once the
finest vintage is consumed?"</div> <P>"Then shed my blood, if you can, little lord," said the wyrm, delighted,
"or I will drink what remains of yours." <P>"My flavour will be too rich," he said, and looked down at the blade
supporting him. "To taste me once is to long for me always. And what
poor brew will quench your appetites once the finest vintage is
consumed?" <P>The wyrm chuckled, a sound like pebbles skittering down a cliff face,
loosening huge boulders to follow crashing in their wake. <P>"Isn't the final taste the sweetest?" it asked. <P>"It is the saddest." <P>The man pulled his sword's point from the ground, looked with disdain
upon his weapon, then swooned, leaning on the wall to keep his feet. <P>"If so, I shall mourn," the wyrm declared, and glided towards him on the
flexing striations of its belly, winding back and forth, its smile
gaping open, all needle teeth and fuming heat. <P>The poet tossed his sword aside, heedless of the wyrm's approach. The
blade tumbled in the air and into the wyrm's yawning gape, piercing its
throat, opening the fire's path and spilling it out into tender places
only meant for virgin flesh. <P>The wyrm coiled upon itself, writhed, knotted, and died. <P>Byron stared at the mound of gold, at the burning hallucination, then
rubbed his eyes and wandered back to the surface, to the camp, to enter
mortal combat with his doctors. <P><small>&copy; Andrew Leon Hudson 2015 All Rights Reserved </small>
