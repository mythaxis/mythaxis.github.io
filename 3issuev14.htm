<div align=center><img src="platport.jpg"><BR><h2>An Excursion to Platport</h2><BR><h3>Les Sklaroff</h3><BR></div>
<div><i>Young Brix presents a more-than-musical offering.</i>
<p class="drop">The house was unnaturally quiet, thought
Aoma Mylhirm, not for the first time, with that familiar unbidden
maternal pang, as she spread cheesefruit paste on a humal leaf, letting
it rest on the plate for a minute to allow the enzymes to interact. <P>It was late afternoon.  Relvin, a senior engineer at the
water-purification plant, was of course still at work, and she must soon
get back to her designing, preferring to work in daylight.  She had been
making pieces on commission for Smigs of Yarp Street ever since they had
accepted that first experimental gold bracelet with the double snake
motif.  It had been on display for only two days before being bought (so
they told her) by a customer who had enigmatically described it as "most
appropriate".   The tumbling and polishing machinery which provided a
kind of white noise background to her lapidary work was currently
switched off, contributing to her unease at the silence, and although
she had easy access to archives of musical recordings, there was nothing
there she could think of that would fill this specific auditory void. <P>She waved a finger at the wall calendar.  A trail of consecutive
squares glowed, the last five a brighter red, reminding her that Brix
would not be back from Platport until the middle of the following week.
Aoma and her husband had tried to find a tutor for him in Snoak, but
exponents of his chosen instrument, let alone instructors, were very
elusive.  Eventually one of Brix's more enlightened teachers had
contacted the music department at Sparagulan College, persuaded by the
boy's obvious enthusiasm for the instrument he had been fortunate enough
to inherit.  They had unhesitatingly recommended Dr Zorioni in Platport. <P>Lovingly designed by K Morrington Follard, the Multingale was an
extraordinary instrument, having the capability, under skilled hands, to
create and blend into a musical form virtually any
imaginable sounds.  It was an instrument that encouraged experiment and
improvisation.  Fewer than a hundred working originals were known to
exist.  None of Zorioni's pupils had come close to achieving his own
degree of mastery, although he had helped some very competent
performers.  He had been intrigued to learn that the young hopeful he
had agreed to see would actually be bringing his own instrument, which
had apparently lain neglected in an attic for many years before being
recently restored. <P>Half a century earlier Erigio Zorioni had captivated audiences in
concert halls and amphitheatres throughout the world.  He no longer gave
public performances, but was devoted enough to his art to want to pass
on his expertise to promising newcomers.  If he judged a prospective
pupil to have sufficient potential he would make no charge for his
tuition, even offering accommodation in his spacious house for the
initial intensive ten days. <P>The Mylhirms had duly travelled from Snoak City, and arrived by
appointment in Platport with their eleven-year old son, Brix, and his
expertly restored Multingale.  Safrana, the cheerful middle-aged woman
whom they presumed to be a housekeeper, led them into a large,
comfortable study, whose tall arched windows looked out onto a frothy
canopy of cherry trees. The lawn was strewn with blown petals,
reminiscent of a wedding scene whose participants had just departed. The
view was partly blocked by a high-backed chair, which slowly swivelled
round to face them, revealing a wispy-haired octogenarian.  He nodded to
the woman, who withdrew, and rose to his feet to greet his visitors. <P>"Ah, Mylhirms.  So pleased." He indicated a capacious sofa.  "Sit."
They sat, the boy between his parents, cradling on his lap a sturdy
custom-made leather carrying-case. <P>"And you are Brix?" <P>"Yes, sir." <P>"So this thing you hide so protectively in the bag&#133;?" <P>"It's my Multingale, sir.  My dad made the case specially, after we got
the Multingale back from the repair shop."  Relvin Mylhirm smiled
modestly. <P>"And how much do you like this instrument?" <P>The unexpected question left Brix momentarily wordless.  The fingers of
his right hand involuntarily stroked the case as if it were a treasured
pet.  He beamed.  "It's great!  I just love it!  It can do anything!
Well, nearly anything.  I mean, I know I've not had it for very long,
but&#133;" <P>Dr Zorioni raised a hand, a distinct twinkle in his bird-bright eyes.
"Soon we shall hear what you can make it do.  Perhaps you would be kind
enough to release it from its most excellent bag," (he nodded
approvingly at Relvin) "While I speak for a moment with your parents."
He beckoned to Aoma and Relvin, and led them through a side door into
the garden. <P>"Mylhirms, please to wander with freedom among my cherries for little
while.  I must assess how touch-familiar with his Multingale is your
boy.  Already I see he has the enthusiasm, which is good sign, very
good, but not enough.  Salfana will bring sandwiches and to drink. There
is seat and bird-bath.  Also sundial."  With this afterthought he waved
towards the clearing beyond the nearest trees, and left them to explore. <P>Brix took a sip from the glass of water Salfana had brought him.
"Before play, water," said Dr Zorioni.  "Afterwards, if satisfactory
playing, something perhaps better.  So, Brix, you are eager musician.
Now we will hear."  Zorioni retrieved from a corner a wheeled stand with
cushioned clamps and an automatic foot-switch.  "Please to rest here
your fine instrument, and bring that stool with red and gold seat.  He
waggled a finger at a side lever.  "You make to adjust for height." <P>The clamps locked gently.  It was a perfect fit!  "I didn't know about
these, sir," Brix said admiringly.  "At home it usually just sits on a
table." <P>"A fine Follard Multingale is like emperor, like great monarch," said
Zorioni.  "Deserves only best throne for display and proper audience.
Now sit on stool.  Before you switch on with foot, please to show me how
you place hands for starting play." <P>Obediently, Brix let his forearms rest on the wrist-pads, fingers poised
to glide or dart over the  arc of keys, or lightly press one of the many
as yet unlit sensors. <P>"So far, good.  Soon maybe I ask you to pick out some particular sounds,
and make mix for feelings to show.  Later we try different pitch,
rhythm, some simple blending chords, so on.  Ready for switch to play
first whatever you like best, yes?"   Zorioni returned to his chair,
closed his eyes and clasped his hands under his chin.  A little
nervously, Brix nodded, flexed his fingers, took a deep breath and
tapped the foot-switch. <P>In the cherry grove his parents looked up from their impromptu picnic
and smiled at each other as they recognized Brix's now familiar touch.
The piece began softly: distant bells, a pattering of falling snow, the
liquid trickle of a stream.  This was gradually intermingled with a
lilting melody, hesitant at first, on a single string - a 'cello,
perhaps, or a viola, continuing and strengthening the flowing theme (was
that a hint of Vlotana?) then merging with a playful burst of
syncopation on brushes and wood-blocks, before adding accordion and
fiddle to transform into an audibly fiery dance, complete with crackling
twigs and the excited barking of a dog. It concluded with a rumbustious
whoosh, like a sudden gust of wind, accompanied by deliberately
melodramatic sounds of crashing and tinkling, followed by the
unmistakable giggling of children.  Brix switched off, and the faint
whirr of the idling instrument died into silence. <P>Erigio Zorioni remained sitting with closed eyes and clasped hands.
Brix blinked, and stared at him anxiously, fearing that the old man
might have lapsed into a coma.  He'd heard tales about people's brains
being affected by certain frequencies, but he knew better than to use
the Multingale's subsonics or ultrasonics in the confinement of a room,
even one of this imposing size.  He cleared his throat.  To his great
relief, Zorioni's eyed opened.  They glistened with tears. <P>"Excuse, Master Brix.  That was foolish ending," he said, shaking his
head reprovingly.  Brix was crestfallen.  He'd only played what felt
right, as he always did.  "<i>But</i>," cried Zorioni, coming over to
grasp both of Brix's hands, "was also excellent surprise!  And not I
hope to make head big as grand balloon, but you have truly beautiful
touch and good concentration." <P>"Salfana!" he called, in a startlingly strong voice for a man of his
advanced years, "Please to rescue the parent Mylhirms, then take this
boy to kitchen for special treat he will choose." <P>By the time Brix was escorted back from the delights of Salfana's
kitchen (his appetite betrayed accidentally on his chin by a few cake
crumbs and the merest smear of cream) Dr Zorioni had come to a formal
agreement with the Mylhirms.  "The boy is raw, full of ideas, but also
little too&#133;"  He searched for the precise word.  "Too precipitate, you
understand?  He will learn to be patient, more subtle as he grows."  He
dropped his voice to a confidential whisper.  "But I tell you, for
beginner he has already wonderful talent."  He bowed.  "Is my honour to
accept him as pupil.  Salfana here will see to all non-musical needs at
my expense."  He dismissed their protests.  "She will give you tour of
house.  After ten days we will consider what future for Brix and his
music.  Was most suitable gift, I think, this fine instrument.  Dear
Mylhirms, is belief of Erigio Zorioni for you to be proud parents of
next Multingale virtuoso!" <P>Aoma applied a dab of flux with a sharpened matchstick to her nest of
silver wire loops, used tweezers to add a tiny paillon, and neatly
soldered the joint before carefully dipping the piece into a weak acid
bath and then running it under the cold tap.  It was to be part of an
amber and turquoise pendant, for which the honey-coloured cabochon was
already prepared.  The sky had begun to cloud over.  That would do for
today, she decided, turning off the tap and walking over to the window,
which looked east towards Garrible Park.  During term time the street
would have been clamorous at this hour with the excited babble of
children returning from school.  Today it was almost deserted.  She
listened hard.   There was a faint hum of distant traffic, the
intermittent buzz of a hedge-trimmer from Welfage Road, a muffled but
querulous altercation between the young siblings next door.  Somewhere
nearby a bird was cheeping persistently.  Well, it wasn't up to Brix's
standard, Aoma thought immodestly, but in his absence she supposed it
was the next best thing. <P><small>&copy; L. J. Sklaroff 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
