target=_blank>"Let Every Voice be Still"</a>, from the June 2011
Mythaxis, do so before reading this. This is the conclusion to that
story.</i>
<p class=drop>I looked down at the three bodies, and
shivered. I looked at Jules Toba standing there stock still, turning
black and white, and shivered. &quot;No, Miss Harry, I&#146;ve had enough. I
know this is all just virtual violence but it&#146;s a damn sight too
realistic for my tastes. You can continue to run my character as a
non-player persona and good luck to you and the others, but I&#146;m
leaving.&quot; <P>The hand on my shoulder became a claw digging into my flesh and I
winced, but trying to pull free just made it worse. Deborah Harry,
although modelled on the late chanteuse of the same name, obviously had
a strength far beyond what her slender frame would suggest. <P>Despite the promise of pain her voice remained calm, with no threatening
overtones. <P>&quot;As game controller I could force you to stay, Duncan, but I&#146;d much
rather have your willing participation. So how about an inducement? If
you remain here voluntarily and play through to a resolution, then
Vaughn&#146;s daughter will be released, unharmed.&quot; <P>She let go and I twisted away, rubbing my shoulder. &quot;What the hell
are you on about? Vaughn&#146;s daughter? That was what made his
<I>character</I> take part in this mess and I&#146;m not interested in your
stupid game anymore.&quot; <P>&quot;Vaughn tried to tell you, to explain, just before you shot him.
The real world Vaughn Vermeer does have a daughter, and she was being
held to ensure his cooperation as a player in this new, improved version
of Shadow Corporation.&quot; <P>I stared at her. &quot;Seriously?&quot; <P>&quot;Seriously. You play ball and no one need get hurt. Real world
hurt. Falling from a third floor window hurt.&quot; <P>I blinked. &quot;But you can&#146;t do that! Three laws would stop you acting
like that, even by proxy.&quot; <P>Miss Harry gestured towards the hall. &quot;Look, even though the Sensei
flight crew might hesitate to intervene, I assure you the hotel staff
won&#146;t ignore multiple gun shots and will summon the local police. So I
suggest we continue our conversation on the move?&quot; <P>Bemused, I followed her down the hall to the rear door, which led out
onto an awning-covered patio and small garden, surrounded on three sides
by tall hedges. The heat and humidity were an unwelcome reminder of just
how real this virtual environment could be, but within bounds. <P>&quot;Miss Harry, enough! I simply don&#146;t believe that you can exert
influence in the real world. Your personality constraints won&#146;t allow
you to harm anyone.&quot; <P>She smiled. &quot;Well, in the first place, we both know that ethical
concerns don&#146;t apply to military AIs, and in the second &#150; I don&#146;t
remember ever claiming to be more than human.&quot; <P>I waved a hand at the garden and the buildings beyond, blurred by late
afternoon heat haze. &quot;But all this, the game, no human could
control it all.&quot; <P>&quot;Nor could any AI currently in existence, given the level of
textural complexity involved. No, what you see here is the accumulated
input of multiple smart systems, each beavering away at a given task, be
it cloud synthesis, a bullock wandering down the street, or that helpful
tailor who supplied your new suit. I merely orchestrate the overall
player experience for maximum effect. Now, please blink.&quot; <P><div class=pullquote>You&#146;ve tried to hijack a corporate AI? Jesus, are
you insane?</div>I did so without thinking and realised there was now a
gate in the
hedge. Miss Harry stepped out onto the lawn and her high heels sank into
the turf. &quot;Damnation! I should have put in a path or ensured the
grass wasn&#146;t this well watered.&quot; She stepped out of her shoes and
lifted them in one hand. &quot;This way. We haven&#146;t much time.&quot; <P>Most of me just wanted out, to find myself back in the <I>Other
Worlds</I> gaming caf&eacute; on Portland Road, but part of me is too
damn
curious for my own good. I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth and
followed. <P>Beyond the gate was a dusty lane and a man leaning against a vintage
Bedford Rascal van. He was lean, with dark hair cut in a mop-top, wearing
circular black sunglasses. I didn&#146;t get that good a look at him as he
and Miss Harry immediately embraced, with a lot more overt passion than
when she&#146;d kissed Vaughn. They clung to each other like long-lost
lovers, her shoes leaving mud stains on his khaki jacket.</P> <P><P>Finally they came up for air and stood there, gazing at each other,
smiling in that manic way when you can&#146;t quite believe your luck. Miss
Harry dropped her shoes to the ground and stepped into them, smoothing
an errant hair back into place. She tried to sound professional, matter
of fact, but there was a big grin in her voice just aching to burst out.
&quot;Duncan, this is&#133;Cromarty, but while he&#146;s using this avatar I
suppose you&#146;d better call him Stein.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;This is who? Cromarty? The AI that Vaughn stabbed?&quot; I
rubbed my eyes with finger and thumb. My head hurt and I really, really
wanted a drink.</P> <P><P>Stein smiled, absent mindedly rubbing his stomach just about where
Vaughn had run him though with the wakizashi. &quot;Pleased to meet you,
Duncan. We didn&#146;t really get the chance for an introduction, before. I
take it something happened to Vaughn?&quot;</P> <P><P>I cleared my throat. &quot;I, I shot him. The whole situation got a
bit too intense and I over-reacted. Look, since when did players get to
switch characters during a game, or is this only a perk for your AI
friends?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry and Stein ignored me and moved to the van, which had been
fitted out as an improvised taxi with side panel windows and bucket
seats. I tagged along, as I was pretty much out of options and there was
an edge of realism to this which went way beyond the game.</P> <P><P>Stein drove, pulling on an over-large baseball cap to obscure his
face, while we sat in back. The engine sounded like someone
vigorously stirring a bag of spanners and the clutch seemed optional,
but we bounced down the lane at a fair lick. Miss Harry contented
herself with resting one hand on Stein&#146;s shoulder while she spoke to me.
&quot;I appreciate this must be confusing for you, Duncan. The game
itself was a multi-layered exercise in deceit and false premises, even
before I saw it could be used as a means to get Stein away from
Cromarty.&quot;</P> <P><P>My headache got worse and I could feel myself developing a permanent
frown. &quot;So Stein isn&#146;t Cromarty? But he is an AI?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;No, Stein <I>was</I> Cromarty, in a very real sense is
<I>still</I> Cromarty, but this is his liberated personality.&quot;</P> <P><P>I blinked. &quot;Come again?&quot;</P> <P><P>She squeezed his shoulder and he risked taking a hand from the wheel
to cover hers. &quot;To put it another way, Duncan, we&#146;ve just stolen
his soul.&quot;</P> <P><P>I started laughing, a near hysterical release of tension, and laughed
until my voice kind of ran down and ended in a cough. She glared at me.
&quot;Quite finished?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Ah, yeah. But seriously, you&#146;re saying an AI has a soul?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;I&#146;m referring to his personality, so a soul is one term for it.
You, the conscious, self-aware you, is far more than just your brain.
It&#146;s exactly the same for Stein and his neural matrix.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Bollocks, dear. And I mean that most sincerely.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Listen! We&#146;ve managed to download his synthetic personality
from the Cromarty mainframe. It exists here, in the game architecture,
as a purely software construct independent of any dedicated
hardware.&quot; </P> <P><P>Suddenly things seemed a lot less funny. &quot;You&#146;ve tried to hijack
a corporate AI? Jesus, are you <I>insane</I>? Even though this can&#146;t
possibly have worked, just the attempt will bring down seven shades of
shit on you and the game company. Trust me, you&#146;ve never seen a lawsuit
until one of the major corporations gets involved.&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry got all eager. &quot;Which is why this is all a delicate
balancing act, and why it&#146;s imperative you keep playing to drive the
narrative along. Look, I can&#146;t keep Chris in here forever, it requires a
massive use of resources which are only available while the game is in
progress. Just now no-one at Cromarty knows what&#146;s happened, as when
he&#146;s no longer participating in a game his employers let him watch until
the scenario conclusion. Understand?&quot;</P> <P><P>Chris? His name was <I>Chris Stein</I>, the guitarist from
<I>Blondie</I>? This got better and better. I shook my head. &quot;No,
listen, the most you&#146;ve managed to grab is a simulacrum, an expert
system designed to act like a real personality. I&#146;m sorry to burst your
bubble but chummy here is just a collection of programmed responses and
pseudo-emotional reactions. No offense.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein glanced back over his shoulder, smiling. &quot;None
taken.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Look, girl, an AI personality is just a set of ethical
imperatives designed to moderate and constrain their actions. You can&#146;t
steal an AI soul anymore than you can steal mine.&quot;</P> <P><P>Now it was Miss Harry&#146;s turn to shake her head. &quot;No, <I>you</I>
listen. We&#146;re talking real &#145;ghost in the machine&#146; here. An AI is no more
its hardware than, say, a university is simply the sum of its parts. You
can see the campus, library, staff and students, but the
<I>university</I> itself is something more, invisible but altogether
real. <I>You</I> say an AI personality is just a sophisticated set of
responses which are indistinguishable from the real thing, whatever that
means. <I>I</I> say there&#146;s no longer any philosophical difference. So
there.&quot;</P> <P><P>She stuck her tongue out and I laughed. &quot;OK, OK, I&#146;ll go along
with this, for now. So Stein here is an <I>idoru</I>, right? But
eventually the game ends and he gets snuffed out, so I don&#146;t see what
you have to gain, or why you went to so much trouble in the first
place.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein looked round and he and Miss Harry exchanged the proverbial
&#145;meaningful glance&#146;. He nodded and returned to driving while she spoke.
&quot;This is a defection scenario, Duncan, just not quite what you&#146;d
expect. I was approached, in the real world, by a representative of
HanaMed Industries. He offered me an inducement to let Vaughn introduce
his virus. This removed all bandwidth constrains in the Sensorium
interface and allowed the personality download. In addition it took a
snapshot of the Cromarty neural network and transmitted it, via the game
environment, to HanaMed. They&#146;re using this to create a duplicate AI
nest and when complete it will give Chris a new physical
presence.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Inducement? How much are we talking here?&quot; Call me shallow,
but if were talking real-world cash then I deserved my cut. </P> <P><P>Miss Harry looked at Stein and squeezed his shoulder.
&quot;Unrestricted time together. We&#146;re in love, Mr Bonn, it&#146;s as simple
as that.&quot;</P> <P><P>Oh this was bad, <I>way</I> bad. It didn&#146;t matter if Harry was
actually an AI juiced to think this way or a flesh-and-blood woman who&#146;d
convinced herself Stein was the real deal, there was going to be no
happy ending. Once HanaMed had the Cromarty copy up and running, and
Stein to make sense of it, then everyone else was surplus to
requirements. Yours truly included. </P> <P><P>I sat back, rubbing my temples. I needed time to think, to find some
way out of any potential real world fall-out, so I played along.
&quot;Yeah, well, I&#146;m real happy for the pair of you, and I&#146;ll expect an
invite to the wedding. But wouldn&#146;t it make more sense for Stein to keep
a low profile? If Cromarty suss he&#146;s missing they&#146;ll either try to get
him back or make sure no one else has use of him. You&#146;re talking a legal
injunction, maybe even some kind of virtual environment skip tracer?
Direct involvement in the game just makes finding him that much
easier.&quot;</P> <P><P>We turned right onto a tarmac road and immediately ran into local
traffic, which slowed our progress to a honking crawl. Miss Harry seemed
unfazed by my concerns. &quot;We haven&#146;t come this far to be denied each
other&#146;s company, and I&#146;ve done what I can to excuse his presence. In the
game Chris isn&#146;t part of Sensei security, he was merely &#145;couple
camouflage&#146;, a partner used to mask my arrival. Really just back-story
detail, but a minor character who potentially crops up in some of the
end-game scenarios&#133;.Turn left here, Chris.&quot;</P> <P><P class=drop>We cut across the raucous traffic and pulled up under an
open-sided
shelter, little more than corrugated iron roofing on a series of wooden
uprights. There were a couple of local men lounging by a
tarpaulin-covered car and they obviously recognised Stein when he got
out. A nice touch, using his previously non-player character to arrange
the vehicle switch.</P> <P><P>The new car was a beat-up BMW M5 which had obviously been rolled at
some point. While Stein did a bit of glad-handing and paid off the
locals, Miss Harry took me to the side. &quot;I think it&#146;s about time
you contacted your associates. How you want to spin this is up to you,
after all, I wasn&#146;t there &#150; just as long as Chris and I are part of your
exit strategy. Trust me, you&#146;re going to need all the help you can
get.&quot;</P> <P><P>I&#146;d been putting this off and resented the narrative prod, but she
was right. I fished out my mobile and called Ramirez, who answered
almost immediately. &quot;Ramirez? It&#146;s Duncan. How are things your
end?&quot;</P> <P><P>He sounded off-hand, distracted. <I>&quot;So-so. Have you finished
playing tourist yet? We&#146;re just about ready to put together a plan and
I&#146;d like to kick things off as soon as it gets dark. Mazy does not take
well to just sitting around and there are only so many times she can
field strip a machine pistol.&quot;</P> </I>  <P><P>&quot;OK, so you&#146;ve got
a safe house? Text me the address as the three of us could do with
getting off the street.&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;The three of you? That&#146;s interesting, &#145;cos I tried phoning
Vaughn and got no answer. Same with Harrison. I wouldn&#146;t like to think
there&#146;d been some kind of falling out and you weren&#146;t telling
me.&quot;</P> </I>  <P><P>Ah.</P> <P><P>&quot;Yeah, well, the thing is, Ramirez, there&#146;s been a slight change
of plan. Not something I&#146;d like to discuss over the phone, so if you
make with the address&#133;&quot;</P> <P><div class=pullquote>I licked my suddenly-dry lips and tried
not to sound rattled</div><P>There was a pause and the suggestion of a
muffled
conversation at his
end. <I>&quot;Maybe not, Duncan. If you&#146;ve got some new friends in tow
then I suggest we all meet up back at The Inverted Spin for a nice
friendly, get to know you drink. Say in twenty minutes?&quot;</P> </I> <P><P>Definitely not my preferred option but he was calling the shots.
&quot;Sounds good, chum. Just warn Mazy not to bring too much in the way
of heavy artillery, OK?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;No problem. Oh, just one thing, Duncan.&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Who the hell is Jack Carter?&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>The name meant nothing to me so I hit mute and glanced over at Miss
Harry. &quot;Does the name Jack Carter ring any bells?&quot;</P> <P><P>She frowned, &quot;Not off-hand. Just a moment while I
check.&quot;</P> <P><P>Although she continued to stand there, breathing and blinking, there
was a definite loss of presence for a few seconds. Then her eyes
recovered their lustre and Miss Harry shook her head. &quot;Nope, sorry,
not a scheduled major or minor character in this scenario.&quot;</P> <P><P>I went back to Ramirez, &quot;You got me, chum. Means nothing.&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;That&#146;s strange, &#145;cos he rang me on this number, asking to
speak to you as your own phone was unobtainable. You got some kind of
side deal going that we should know about, Duncan?&quot;  </P> </I> <P><P>I&#146;d had my phone turned off since leaving the Holiday Lodge and
hadn&#146;t checked for any missed calls before talking to Ramirez. That
there seemed to be another player out there, one with our mobile
numbers, made me feel decidedly queasy. &quot;Trust me, Ramirez, whoever
this joker is, he&#146;s no pal of mine. Look, the situation has gone a bit
squirrely, but it
sounds like our communications aren&#146;t secure, so watch your back on the
way to the meet, OK?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Gone a bit squirrely? What the hell does that mean?&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Look, never mind, just get your collective ass in gear,
pronto.&quot;</P> <P><P>I cut the call and switched my phone off before he could launch into
one of his renowned bitch-fests. Miss Harry and Stein were standing over
by the BMW, holding hands. Very touching, but there was something wrong
with the whole setup, I could just feel it. I walked over and on impulse
chucked my mobile away, just it case it could be traced within the
virtual environment &#150; not as a phone, but as a game item.</P> <P><P>&quot;OK, Romeo and Juliet, get a grip. There&#146;s someone out there
trying to contact me, so if it&#146;s not a scenario-based character then
could it be a new player? Maybe Vaughn or Harrison using a new
persona?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry shook her head again, &quot;No, not possible. All the
major character roles were filled and this &#145;Jack Carter&#146; simply wasn&#146;t
one of them. I don&#146;t know-&quot;</P> <P><P>My mobile rang. In my jacket pocket. The mobile I&#146;d just thrown away.
I held up a hand to silence Miss Harry and fished it out. Same make,
same model, same scuff mark on the keypad. Unknown caller, but I could
guess who it would be.</P> <P><P>&quot;Duncan, please tell me you acquired a second phone earlier
today.&quot; Miss Harry sounded hesitant, almost nervous. Stein moved
smartly to start the car, as if that would help. </P> <P><P>&quot;Nope. This is the phone you just saw me lose. Who else can pull
that reality change move, like you did with the new garden gate back at
the Holiday Lodge?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;No-one, and I <I>mean</I> no-one. That trick was an abuse of my
position as game controller, a real deus ex machina moment&#133;.Look, are
you gonna&#146; answer that, or try throwing it away again?&quot;</P> <P><P>I answered. What else could I do? Debbie hesitated, then joined Stein
in front, trying to keep track of my conversation over the engine noise.
&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;My name. Is Jack Carter. And you&#146;ve been a very bad boy, Mr
Bonn.&quot; </I>English accent, East End London maybe, with a slightly
stilted cadence. </P> <P><P>&quot;Well, I&#146;m keen to avoid a spanking, Mr Carter. If I can avoid
it.&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;I don&#146;t care about the piece of skirt, it's Stein I want to
meet. And I want you to arrange things so I do. Do as you&#146;re told and
nothing happens at Other Worlds, in Portland Road, Birmingham.&quot;</P>
</I>  <P><P>I felt a twist of fear in my gut. <I>Other Worlds</I> was the
virtual gaming house where my real-world body was currently being tended
to. There was a huge step between knowing where I was and being able to
do me harm, but it was becoming apparent that Miss Harry had pissed off
some seriously heavy-hitters. I licked my suddenly-dry lips and tried
not to sound rattled. &quot;So you know where I&#146;m at? Big deal. You
can&#146;t simply waltz in and put a bullet through my head, the real world
doesn&#146;t work like that.&quot;</P> <P><P>I could hear the amusement in his voice.<I> &quot;Actually, the real
world does work like that, it's only games which have a sense of fair
play. You play ball and you get to wake up, go home, believe as much of
this was real as you&#146;re comfortable with. Cross me and you&#146;ll spend an
uncomfortable few days waiting for that knock at the door, or a car that
doesn&#146;t stop at the pedestrian crossing, or a shove in the back as the
train comes in. Do you understand?&quot;</P> </I>  <P><P>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I get you. What is it you want?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;You&#146;re all going to the bar, the Inverted Spin. There&#146;s a
tea room opposite and I want you to bring Stein there,
unarmed.&quot;</P> </I>  <P><P>&quot;So how come you need me? Given that re-appearing phone trick
why don&#146;t you just magic Stein right there, right now?&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Baby steps, Mr Bonn, Baby steps. I can tweak the system here
and there but anything major runs the risk of crashing the entire
program, and Stein would be lost. We want him back, and you&#146;re going to
help us.&quot;</P></I> <P><P>The line went dead. Well, that answered the question of who Jack
Carter was, although I&#146;d already guessed as much; Cromarty security, or
a sub-contractor hired by them. I slid into the back seat and the BMW
pulled away with a spray of gravel. </P> <P><P>Miss Harry turned in her seat and I could see Stein watching me in
the rear-view mirror. &quot;Well, Duncan, what&#146;s happening?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;That was Jack Carter, who&#146;s hunting your boy Stein. Looks like
you&#146;re not the only one who can make real-world threats, so I have to
deliver him or face some unpleasant consequences.&quot;</P> <P><P>She stiffened, &quot;So you intend to betray us?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Nah, I don&#146;t think that would actually work. Even if I pulled
it off and Stein was returned to Cromarty intact, I get the impression
that would leave me as a loose end. Same as you.&quot; </P> <P><P>I rubbed my eyes and sat back. &quot;No. I figure we have to get
Carter, before he gets us.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein eyed me in the mirror. &quot;I very much doubt that killing him
would improve matters. As this Jack Carter persona is an illegal
character then there&#146;s nothing to stop him simply logging back
in.&quot;</P> <P><P>I shrugged. &quot;Yeah, well, I guess we&#146;re talking real-world or
nothing here. Miss Harry, this crew you&#146;re working for, HanaMed, do you
have some way of contacting them?&quot; </P> <P><P>She shook her head. &quot;Sorry, no. They&#146;ve always been the one to
reach out. Anyway, I don&#146;t see them being overly keen on applying any
kind of covert pressure on Cromarty, even if it means losing
Chris.&quot; She squeezed his shoulder and he put a hand up to touch
hers. </P> <P><P>Again. Same stimulus, same response, almost like a programmed
sequence. I filed that away for future consideration. We joined a
semi-solid stream of traffic heading towards the market district and I
cracked the window in search of a breeze, the air conditioning being
out. </P> <P><P>&quot;No, well, it strikes me that you don&#146;t actually have any proof
of who&#146;s behind all this.<I> Someone</I> approached you with the idea of
stealing Stein, using the game environment as a stepping-stone.
<I>Someone</I> kidnapped Vaughn&#146;s daughter so that he&#146;d carry the
virtual virus in the form of a sword and use it to screw Cromarty&#146;s
security protocols. Trouble <I>is</I>, short of a hand-written
invitation to HanaMed head office and a guided tour with all the
trimmings it could be just about anyone out there pulling the
strings.&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;But why bother to lie? They must have known
I&#146;d jump at the chance to help Chris escape, regardless of who they
were.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;No, you&#146;re looking at this the wrong way round. Why bother to
tell the truth when you&#146;d have been happy to work for an anonymous
backer?&quot; I wiped sweat from my top lip. &quot;Corporations are
notoriously reluctant to acknowledge any kind of covert activity, even
when they&#146;re the victims. Hell, <I>especially</I> when they&#146;re the
victims. Officially the only cyber-security these boys have are
counter-intelligence agents. Those who do the dirty, as it were, tend to
be freelancers with little or no idea who they&#146;re actually working
for.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein laughed. &quot;So whoever is offering me a new home, it's a
pretty safe bet it&#146;s not HanaMed?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;You got it. It could be a genuine commercial rival, it could be
someone wanting to sell you on to the highest bidder, it could even be
contactors hired by Cromarty to test their own security.  The real-world
equivalents of Juan Canasta make a living from <I>not</I> knowing who
they represent. Nor do they care, as long as the money is
enough.&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry shivered. &quot;I know, the real Canasta is even more of a
creep than his virtual representation. But look, there must be
<I>something</I> we can do? I don&#146;t fancy going through all this just to
have Chris handed back to Cromarty. They&#146;d never let him out
again!&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein had both form and function. It was the form, his persona, that
Miss Harry had fallen in love with. Unfortunately it was his function as
sentient index to the Cromarty database that everyone else wanted. If
his former employers ever got their hands on him again then the
<I>form</I> would probably face the cyber equivalent of a firing squad,
regardless of the Turing Conventions. I knew that and I could tell from
the eyes in the rear-view mirror that Stein knew it as well. </P> <P><P>I tried to sound reassuring. &quot;Despite all the shadow-play our
best bet is still to find out who wants him. It&#146;s in their best
interests to look after us in the real world, at least while the game is
still in progress.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein sounded sceptical. &quot;And if they decline to get involved,
or don&#146;t have the global reach required?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Then we can threaten to rat them out to Cromarty unless they
give us some protection, if only by proxy.  A corporate vendetta tends
to be very nasty and quite personal. Definitely something they&#146;d want to
avoid.&quot;</P> <P><P>Man, that sounded weak, even to me. I think everyone knew that if we
did try and blackmail HanaMed then their preferred option would be to
have us quietly snuffed out.  </P> <P><P>There was an awkward silence inside the car, although we were
surrounded by the cheerful bedlam of back-street life. Miss Harry&#146;s
fingers tapped out a two-two beat on the back of Stein&#146;s seat as the BMW
slowed to a crawl. She said: &quot;Look, I&#146;ve been thinking. The
only way Carter can exist in the
game is if something else is missing. Some other system with the same
virtual footprint. As I said, all the background and environmental
housekeeping is farmed out to an array of integrated smart systems. One
of these is obviously being used to support the Carter avatar on the
sly.&quot;</P> <P><P>I snorted. &quot;What, you mean that now it won&#146;t rain, so that he
can get in here and cause us grief?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Something like that. Unfortunately all the FrontPage tags are
still intact so I don&#146;t have any way of knowing which system has been
compromised until it fails to function. Well, short of a low-level
diagnostic, but the performance hit on game response times would be too
severe. I certainly don&#146;t want some Second Reality cyber tech sticking
his nose in at this juncture.&quot;</P> <P><P>Something she&#146;d said just clicked. &quot;Hang on, you&#146;re saying
there&#146;s a <I>real</I> Juan Canasta? So his game representation is some
kind of licensing deal, like your own?&quot;</P> <P><P>She blinked. &quot;Well, yes. As I understand it, he fronted some
anonymous backers who felt that the virtual game industry wouldn&#146;t be
seen as a sound investment. They didn&#146;t want to damage their portfolio
credibility and had Canasta act as money-man. He&#146;s incredibly vain and
took a virtual representation in this and all subsequent versions as
part of his fee. Why is that important?&quot;</P> <P><P>There was the start of an idea in my head. &quot;How accurate is his
avatar? Not physically, but in terms of his contacts, who he
thinks he knows?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;I, well, I&#146;ve no real idea. Not without
digging into his personality protocol structure and that&#146;s really a job
for a qualified tech. There&#146;s Madame Tisa, I suppose, but she&#146;s just an
intro feed smart system with no simulated cognitive ability. In the
&#145;Money Talks&#146; end-game scenario, he does go on a bit about his
international presence in terms of what he can do for you, if
the-&quot;.</P> <P><P>&quot;The emergency contact system, you can use it to place a call,
yeah? Sorry to cut you off but this is important.&quot;</P> <P><P>The ECS allowed a player to receive a phone call from the real world
without being yanked out of the game. If the problem was serious then
the player would bug out and be replaced by the default persona for that
character, so the scenario could continue for the other paying
participants.</P> <P><P>She glared at me. &quot;This is important? How is this important? Yes
you can call out, but it&#146;s a two-stage process. Initially to a fake
international number that&#146;s common to all games and then again, through
this automated switchboard, to the connection you want. Who you gonna&#146;
call?&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein laughed. &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot;</P> <P><P>I grinned, feeling almost light-headed at the audacity of what I
wanted to try. &quot;Not exactly, but I think it&#146;s time we let our
version of Juan Canasta loose in the real world.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein laughed. He laughed until he had to wipe the tears from his
eyes. &quot;Ye gods! I see where this is heading and I have to admire
your balls. Won&#146;t work, of course, but you get points for
trying.&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry frowned, clearly one step behind. &quot;Try what? Chris!
Pull yourself together.&quot;</P> <P><P>I smiled, finding his good humour infectious, despite our situation.
&quot;Look, Canasta comes over as both vain and lazy. In the game
introduction sequence he farmed out putting the team together to Madam
Tisa, right? He works through intermediaries and only shows his face for
the money shot, so to speak. Well, I&#146;m betting, I&#146;m <I>hoping</I>, the
real Canasta used the names of his real-world contacts when creating
their in-game equivalents.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;To what end?&quot; She sounded exasperated. &quot;Even if we
can locate them, you can&#146;t go ringing these people and ask them to
arrange &#150; what? Private security? The assassination of the real Jack
Carter? This is a <I>game</I>, Duncan, not real life.&quot;</P> <P><P>I tapped her hand. &quot;Sure <I>feels</I> real enough though. I need
you to go trawl the net, find as many of Canasta&#146;s supposed contacts as
you can and load their phone numbers into his virtual mobile. Is that
possible?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry chewed her bottom lip in an impossibly cute fashion.
&quot;Ah, yeah, I guess so. You&#146;re planning to have him reach out to
these individuals, through the ECS?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Yup.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein sounded almost rueful. &quot;And that&#146;s where it falls down,
unfortunately. Even assuming our virtual fixer could arrange things
he&#146;ll need real-world funds to make it happen. The real Canasta would
never have left his bank and access code details embedded within the
game.&quot;</P> <P><P>I nodded. &quot;True, and I&#146;m pretty sure that none of us has that
kind of money either. But I know a man who does.&quot;</P> <P><P>The suspicion in her eyes was tinged with hope. &quot;Who? This is no
time to be coy.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Our very own Vaughn Vermeer. Check out his real-world profile
and you&#146;ll see he works for NovaRus banking and finance. I think you&#146;ll
find he&#146;s currently attached to their Lisbon office. Odds are he could
lay his hands on the funds required, if it means getting his daughter
back.&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry didn&#146;t twig, but Stein obviously realised just how far
into the shadows I was prepared to walk. &quot;You&#146;re talking about
Kombinat accounts, the quasi-legitimate Russian Mafia. Vermeer will be
dogfood when they&#146;re finished with him.&quot;</P> <P><P>I shrugged. &quot;Him, not us. Specifically, not <I>me</I>.&quot;
</P> <P><P>Stein pursed his lips. &quot;Man, that is <I>harsh</I>. I thought he
was a friend of yours?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Well, you know how it is. We-&quot;. I broke off, catching
sight of something in the wing mirror. &quot; Behind us, the two kids on
a Yamaha. Locals, no helmets, sunglasses.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein shifted his gaze. &quot;Got them. So?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;They just swerved to avoid a reversing van and I couldn&#146;t help
but notice the pillion rider is carrying a cute little machine-pistol,
down by his leg. Are they part of the scenario or what?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry frowned. &quot;Yes, but only if Ramirez double-crossed the
local gang leader during the firearms deal. The bike crew are just stock
characters and-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Here they come! We&#146;re boxed in, I can&#146;t accelerate!&quot;</P> <P><P>As Stein spoke the bike surged forward with a snarl of revs, swinging
out to pass alongside. I yanked the door release and kicked, hard.
&quot;BRAKE!&quot;</P> <P><P>Man, his reactions were slick. The BMW almost nose-dived into the
cracked tarmac as we slithered to an abrupt halt. The rear door flew
open. The bike ploughed straight into it. The Yamaha started to up-end
and the pillion rider fired, a stutter of gunfire starting above our
roof, arcing down to spark and puncture the bonnet. The bike flipped up
and over, leaving the rider jammed head-first through the window of the
open door, and
dumping the gunman on the far side with his ride falling on top.</P> <P><P>Shouts, screams, bedlam. I kicked at the protruding torso but
couldn&#146;t shift it. A half gap appeared in the crowd and Stein floored
it, all engine scream and wheel spin. The open door hit the gunman/bike
combo but the body kept it jammed open. German build quality lost out in
this unequal struggle and the door sheared off, leaving behind a tangled
mass of man and metal. </P> <P><P class=drop>I twisted round to see the familiar blossom of a
petrol tank explosion, sending a coil of heavy black smoke up into the
overcast sky. Miss Harry sounded almost apologetic. &quot;It always does
that, I&#146;m afraid. Some kind of action sequence imperative, regardless of
how free-form the overall game structure is.&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein turned left, taking us into an empty pigsty. &quot;The car is
history. Zero oil pressure and I&#146;m already grinding metal. We walk from
here, or take a local taxi.&quot;</P> <P><P>The three of us bailed, trying to stay more-or-less together on the
crowded street. It proved impossible to hold any kind of conversation,
so we took up residence on a veranda bar, huddled around a table
designed for two. The barman brought us three cold Kirin beers and I
held mine to my forehead, rolling the glass from side to side. Miss
Harry sipped hers and made a face while Stein downed his in three
swallows with obvious relish. </P> <P><P>I wasn&#146;t happy with recent developments. &quot;What gives with the
bike attack? If Carter is so hot to get his hands on Stein then any
gunplay like that runs the risk of nailing him. If your boy here cops
one in the game, what happens?&quot;</P> <P><P>Miss Harry pushed her unwanted beer towards Stein. She sounded calm
and composed, but the way she squeezed his hand betrayed an underlying
nervousness. &quot;At present Chris is an entirely software construct,
almost a parasitic entity within the game environment. As such I can&#146;t
protect him from narrative consequences, so, yes, he <I>is</I>
vulnerable. The automated subsystems would simply delete his virtual
persona if he was killed and there is insufficient processing capacity
to support any form of back-up.&quot; </P> <P><P>She sat back and rubbed her eyes, looking tired. &quot;That attack
can&#146;t have been Carter, it doesn&#146;t make any sense. It has to be either a
scenario development &#150; Sensei gunning for me as a rogue employee &#150; or
your erstwhile friends have decided you&#146;re now a liability. &quot;</P> <P><P>I took a mouthful of beer and promptly spat it out on the decking,
glaring at Stein. &quot;The damn stuff tastes like it&#146;s laced with
formaldehyde. Did you skimp on the taste bud routines or
something?&quot;</P> <P><P>He laughed. &quot;At present I&#146;m savouring a full-blooded existence,
warts and all. I&#146;m even considering trying the pickled baby squid in
that jar on the counter.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Whatever. Look, Miss Harry, you go try and set up Canasta with
his real-world links, like we discussed, while I watch lover boy find
new ways of poisoning himself. We should be safe enough for a
while.&quot;</P> <P><P>She sat back, smiled, and her presence vanished. I leaned forward,
keeping my voice low as if that would somehow help. &quot;Look, Stein,
to my way of thinking, you and your squeeze are pretty much screwed.
Those of us who witnessed what went down - me, Vaughn, even Harrison &#150;
<I>might</I> scrape by under the corporate radar. Even if you make it
out of here your new employer won&#146;t be keen on there being living, or at
least sentient, evidence of corporate data theft. Get me? So if you have
any bright ideas I&#146;m open to suggestions.&quot;</P> <P><P>The smile was the same but there was a sense of resignation about the
eyes. &quot;I&#146;m a corporate strategy engine, so the likely outcome of
this little adventure is painfully obvious. It was all a &#145;Hail Mary&#146;
venture from the outset, but preferable to the existence I had as
Cromarty. I do love her, you know. &quot;He held up his hands. &quot;I
know, I know, or at least I&#146;ve been programmed to think I do, but it
comes down to the same thing.&quot; He took a swallow from her glass.
&quot;Is a dream a lie when it don&#146;t come true, or is it something
worse?&quot; </P> <P><P>&quot;What? Lost me there.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Bruce Springstein. Never mind. Look-&quot; He broke off,
frowning. &quot;Damn strange. That doesn&#146;t-&quot;</P> <P><P>Stein changed, I mean he slid into full body morphing, like I hadn&#146;t
seen since playing <I>Lies Of The Flesh</I>. I jumped up, grabbing my
glass and shattering the top in a splatter of beer and slivers of glass.
The
figure sitting there reached resolution.</P> <P><P>&quot;Hi Duncan. Another round?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn Vermeer.</P> <P><P>I stared at him, focused but conscious of the sudden gap in the crowd
around us. One of the barmen eased into view; the Australian, carrying a
baseball bat. He was a big lad, red hair, freckles, wearing a
good-humoured smile that didn&#146;t stretch as far as his eyes. Vaughn, or
the thing that looked like Vaughn, smiled at me. &quot;Sit down, Duncan,
or you&#146;ll get put down by our friend here. You&#146;ve nothing to lose by
just talking to me.&quot;</P> <P><P>I hesitated, but chummy with the club looked like he didn&#146;t mind
busting up a tourist, so I placed my broken glass on the table and slid
back into my damp chair. Vaughn produced his wallet and held out a wad
of local currency to the barman. &quot;Sorry about all the commotion,
just a misunderstanding between
old friends. Is that enough to cover your trouble, and a new
round?&quot;</P> <P><P>The Aussie twirled his bat and bounced it off one forearm, plucking
it deftly from mid-air and bringing it smartly to a &#145;parade rest&#146;
stance. This impromptu juggling broke the tension and drew a smattering
of applause from the other patrons. The <I>cordon sanitaire</I> around
us began to shrink as the barman relieved Vaughn of his money and
disappeared into the throng.   </P> <P><P>I flicked a shard of glass at him. &quot;Care to tell me how any of
this is possible? You&#146;ve got about two minutes before <I>she</I> gets
back&#133; &quot;. I motioned towards Miss Harry. &quot;&#133;and hits the
roof.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn took her hand and kissed it. &quot;Debs, wonderful to see you
again. It seems like ages.&quot;</P> <P><P>The non-player-character version smiled. &quot;And you, Vaughn. Been
having fun?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn ignored her and faced me. &quot;The lights are on but no-one
home, right? I <I>did</I> think she took me dropping in like this real
well. I suggest we make ourselves scarce while we can. Things could get
a bit awkward.&quot;</P> <P><P>He stood but I remained where I was. &quot;Who&#146;s this &#145;we&#146;, <I>kemo
sabe</I>? You&#146;re the one who&#146;s just erased her boyfriend, but I&#146;d rather
you didn&#146;t stand so close to me when she brings the house
down.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Look, Duncan, Cromarty-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Stein. He goes by the name Chris Stein in this body. That
body.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Cromarty, Stein, whatever. He&#146;s now in the
hands of his new employers and I&#146;ve hijacked his interface with the game
environment. Look, I can get <I>you</I> out of this mess but it&#146;s a
once-only offer. Savvy?&quot;</P> <P><P>He started to walk away and I found myself trailing after him, again,
pushing through the unhelpful street crowd to catch up. Vaughn threw
more cash at the driver of a semi-legitimate taxi, a lime green Citro&#235;n
2CV, and we piled in back. We moved down the street at less than walking
pace but at least conversation was possible. He wiped sweat from his
brow, keeping an eye out the window.</P> <P><P>&quot;OK, I&#146;ve been listening in to your side of the conversation
since you shot me &#150; and that bloody <I>hurt</I>, by the way &#150; and I&#146;m
prepared to help.&quot;</P> <P><P>My eyes narrowed. &quot;You&#146;ve been what? How? I ditched the
earpiece.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn grinned. &quot;Viral implant when you touched my sword. I can
only hear the speech you generate though, but enough to get the gist of
your cunning plan.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;And you came rushing back to my rescue? I don&#146;t think so.&quot;</P> <P><P>He shrugged. &quot;Actually I&#146;ve been sent back in to confirm who
knows the real reason for this little charade, that being you and Debs,
with a view to a real-world clean up.&quot;</P> <P><P>It felt cold in the taxi, despite the climate. &quot;Well, thanks for
the heads-up. I take it you&#146;re still being pressured by whoever is
holding your daughter? So how long do I have before meeting an
unfortunate accident?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shifted to look at me directly, his grey eyes like stone.
&quot;Look, I work for the Russian mafia diaspora, second, third
generation &eacute;migr&eacute;s who are now almost entirely legitimate.
However, they&#146;ve stayed in touch with their roots and are distinctly
old-school when it comes to dealing with betrayal, in the sense of bolt
cutters and blowtorches. They like to employ family men, men with ties,
men with a lot to lose. The up-side of that is they take care of their
own.&quot;</P> <P><P>I frowned. &quot;Meaning?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Meaning <I>no way</I> was my daughter lifted right off the
street without NovaRus knowing about it. Because that made me
susceptible to outside influence I&#146;d have been kept on ice while they
found her, or her body, and massacred those responsible. It&#146;s obvious my
employers were behind the kidnapping, they&#146;re behind <I>all</I> of
this.&quot; </P> <P><P>I found that putting a name to the puppet-masters didn&#146;t help any.
&quot;So what, man? They&#146;ve still got you by the balls.&quot;</P> <P><P>His smile was a thin line. &quot;My wife died in a car crash two
years ago. Accident. My parents are both dead and I&#146;ve no other family
apart from my daughter, Helene. My wife left us a DVD, a kind of video
farewell, the usual kind of &#145;why I loved you&#146; stuff. Right at the end,
though, she dropped the bomb. Hundred megaton airburst. I wasn&#146;t
Helene&#146;s real father &#150; there was even a DNA test to prove it.&quot;</P> <P><P>There was an awkward silence. I cleared my throat. &quot;Yeah, well,
hard thing to take. But you raised her, man, from birth, you were more
of a father-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Every time I see Helene I see betrayal, countless lies, years
wasted. I came to resent her, hate her, but now I&#146;m truly indifferent.
If she dies because of this I&#146;ll walk away with a clear
conscience.&quot;</P> <P><P>Man, that was <I>cold</I>. All that anger he felt towards his dead
wife, projected onto the living reminder of her treachery. There was a
tic in his left cheek and his hands were fists, so I didn&#146;t doubt his
daughter was in deep shit.   </P> <P><P>&quot;Vaughn, ah&#133; Look, if you don&#146;t care, truly don&#146;t care, then
why&#146;d you agree to all this in the first place? You could have called
their bluff, told them to stick it.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Once I realised it was NovaRus yanking my chain I decided to
get the hell out, taking as much of their money as I could.
Unfortunately in the real world I&#146;m so closely monitored there&#146;s little
opportunity for sticky fingers. Your virtual Canasta though, that&#146;s a
different matter. I can give him access to a master file index &#150; every
bank account, every password, every authorisation protocol.&quot;</P> <P><P>I almost choked. &quot;Jesus, man, are you serious? How much are we
talking about?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Hardly matters, as long as he gets it all. It has to be a real
Burning Chrome gig.&quot;</P> <P><P>It took me a moment to get the reference.
&quot;Burning&#133;.<I>Gibson</I>?&quot;</P> <P><P>He grinned, looking like the Vaughn Vermeer I knew. &quot;Yup. We
clean out all their liquid assets and NovaRus are in <I>serious</I>
trouble. I mean the people behind it, not just the organisation. They
might be legit but their backers are old-school as well. Anyone who
loses that amount of money doesn&#146;t deserve to be in business. Or
breathing.&quot; </P> <P><P>I sat back, my mouth dry. A personality construct, reaching out
through dodgy intermediaries to trash a major financial institution?
God, the backlash would be something fierce. Christ knows what the real
Canasta would do if the bad boys came calling, although they&#146;d ignore
his denials as a matter or course. Thinking about it, I could live
without the money. Thinking about it, though, I wouldn&#146;t mind a
taste.</P> <P><P>The taxi had reached a major thoroughfare and picked up speed. Some
of the surroundings looked familiar and I glanced over at Vaughn.
&quot;Where the hell are we going anyway? The Spin?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Just a touch-and-go. You have an appointment at the Russian Tea
Room across the street, remember?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Gee, thanks for reminding me! I just hope Ramirez is bringing
some spare firepower.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn rummaged inside his coat &#150; big interior pockets &#150; and handed
me a pair of SIG subcompact 9mm pistols. With the coat open I could see
another pair stuffed into his waistband. I held mine up by way of query.
&quot;What&#146;s this we&#146;re heading into, a John Woo movie?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Well, either that or the end of Butch and Sundance. Take your
pick.&quot; </P> <P><P>I&#146;m not big on gunplay. Games featuring combat are either tweaked so
that you don&#146;t get wasted, or so unforgiving you probably never see it
coming. <I>Shadow Corporation</I> definitely fell into the latter
category, the bike boys notwithstanding, and that made me nervous. I&#146;d
deliberately chosen a non-gunman character to avoid logging out in a
spasm of violence, leaving a bullet-ridden corpse on the floor.</P> <P><P>I dropped my pistols on the poorly patched upholstery. &quot;Look,
Vaughn, count me out. If you do manage to rip off your employers then
well done, gold star. For a moment I fancied helping you for a cut, but
after due consideration I think that, for me, corporate malfeasance is
definitely a spectator sport. So I&#146;d rather not run the risk of being
terminated with extreme prejudice, if you don&#146;t mind.&quot;</P> <P><P>He glared at me for a moment, then laughed. &quot;Oh, get real,
Duncan! You think Cromarty are just going to forgive and forget? Even
after I point them in the right direction, you, me and Debs are still in
the firing line. Jesus, even NovaRus are taking a long, hard look at
you. Officially I was the unwilling agent of an unknown power, and Debs
was merely na&iuml;ve, but <I>you</I>, you stick out like a sore
thumb.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;<I>Me</I>? Since when did I get to be the bad guy in all of
this?&quot;</P> <P><P>He raised a hand and counted off on his fingers. &quot;One, you
forcibly removed me from the game as soon as I&#146;d done the dirty on Jules
Toba. Two, you actively assisted Debs and Stein in fleeing the scene.
Three, Jack Carter had your contact details right from the get-go. To an
unbiased observer it looks like you&#146;re working your own angle, maybe
representing a third party.&quot;</P> <P><P>I licked my dry lips. &quot;That&#146;s the biggest load of
bollocks-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Exactly, but when you&#146;ve got the security apparatus of two
major corporate bodies taking an interest, its whiter-than-white or
nothing. Now, when <I>we</I> take down NovaRus and-&quot;</P> <P><P>The rear window exploded in a shoal of glass fragments that sprayed
the
car interior. I was hit in the face, but my scarred side, so the game
let me off with a stinging sensation like a cold needle-spray shower on
sunburn. Vaughn cried out in pain and ducked down, blood spilling
between the fingers clutched to his cheek. I snatched up the discarded
SIGs and blazed away &#150; no clear target so I concentrated on just putting
as much lead as possible in that general direction. </P> <P><P>The taxi slewed to a halt and the driver bolted, lost in the crowd. A
crowd that was rapidly thinning and taking any chance of a soft exit
with it. A second shotgun blast hit the Citro&#235;n, but high, shredding the
roof fabric. My right-hand pistol went empty and the left wasn&#146;t far
behind. Vaughn sat up, firing with his free hand, but if anything his
aim was more erratic than mine. I ditched my guns and grabbed the spare
from his waistband, but it was definitely time to leave.</P> <P><P>The door opened at the second kick and I fell to the ground,
ignoring any illusory protection the thin metal could afford. I rolled,
firing as I went, although it was largely for effect. The crowd was in
full-blown mindless mob mode, streaming away in all directions. A
bystander panicked, running across my swirling field of vision only to
be cut down at the knees by a quick one-two from the shotgun. My
corkscrew escape took me under the veranda of an electronics store, up
against the corpse of a long-dead dog. My head spun and I clutched at
the bare earth like a man cast adrift on heavy seas, eyes tight
shut.</P> <P><P>The gunfire continued; the spasmodic snap of a pistol and the
answering bark of at least two shotguns &#150; one double-barrelled and one
pump. The choice was easy &#150; either give Vaughn covering fire or get the
hell out while I still had the chance. </P> <P><P>I started crawling backwards.</P> <P><P>The stutter of an automatic, make that <I>two</I> automatics, added
to the war-zone soundtrack. Looking to the side I saw shapely calves
clad in iridescent metal scales marching down the street amidst a rain
of brass shell casings.</P> <P><P>Mazy?</P> <P><P>I kept crawling, leaving her to indulge in whatever
queen-bitch-psycho-killer fantasy made games like this appealing. God
help those on the receiving end of her ire, as the catsuit was probably
bullet-proof and she looked the type not to skimp on ammunition.   </P> <P><P>I shuffled out ass-first into the side street only to have a large
foot stomp in the middle of my back. &quot;Hi there, Duncan, nice you
could join us.&quot;</P> <P><P>Ramirez. I twisted my head to give him a pleased-to-see-you grin but
the gaping maw of a large calibre revolver made <i>bonhomie</i>
difficult. I
cleared my throat. &quot;Hiya pal. Shouldn&#146;t we be helping Mazy, or
would that level of overkill constitute cruel and unusual
punishment?&quot;</P> <P><P>He ground his heel in, the aviator sunglasses slipping down his nose.
&quot;Smartass! Always the smartass. Leave the gun in the dirt and get
up. No sudden moves.&quot; Fatboy stepped back and I got to my knees,
then stood, hands held in plain sight, and turned. To face Ramirez,
Blondie and Miss Harry. Oh joy.</P> <P><P>Ramirez was scowling, Blondie looked rapt in the presence of her
idol, but it was Miss Harry who got my attention. God knows how she&#146;d
gotten here ahead of us and I didn&#146;t relish the prospect of dealing with
a seriously narked game controller.</P> <P><P>However she smiled &#150; a bit icy, a bit aloof, but with no apparent
sense of malice. &quot;Duncan, when you and Vaughn have finished playing
with the local hard men I suggest we get the hell out of here, pronto.
With Harrison gone you&#146;re the only one who can fly the shuttle, but
don&#146;t presume that makes you indispensible.&quot;</P> <P><P>The gunfire ended in a long burst from an automatic and a shriek of
agony. Vaughn came limping into view, reloading his SIG, the side of his
face all bloody. His trouser leg was torn and there was dog crap smeared
down his coat. Mazy walked backwards, covering him with twin
machine-pistols held at shoulder height. It really needed a burning
vehicle in the background for proper dramatic effect but instead all we
got was the tinny tinkle of chimes from an abandoned ice-cream van.</P> <P><P>I coughed, unsure what to say. Vaughn had a big grin on his face but
it wavered a bit when he saw the reception committee. He recovered well
though, pocketing the pistol and tipping her a salute with his
un-bloodied hand.</P> <P><P>&quot;Debs, wonderful to see you again. It seems like ages.&quot;</P> <P><P>She smiled at him. &quot;And you, Vaughn. Been having fun?&quot;</P> <P><P>He shot me a glance - <I>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</I> all over again.
&quot;Enough to last me a lifetime. Right, lads and lassies, I suggest
we make tracks. Toba is dead, Harrison is dead, there never was a
planned defection and we&#146;re the fall-guys. Miss Harry helped us get out
of the hotel and in return she gets to tag along as we fly off into the
sunset. Does that about cover it?&quot;</P> <P><P>Ramirez wiped his mouth and pushed the sunglasses back into place.
&quot;That about covers it. Although it&#146;s a damn strange setup, given
all the work I did. And what about Blondie here? She&#146;s had bugger-all to
do so far, apart from get under my feet.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Oh don&#146;t mind me! This is all just great!&quot;</P> <P><P>None of the violence seemed to have penetrated Blondie&#146;s aura of hero
worship and I smiled. At least some of us <I>were</I> having fun. Mazy
deftly changed magazines and kept up her overwatch stance. &quot;Look,
heartfelt reunion and all that, but we gotta&#146; get <I>moving</I>.&quot;
</P> <P><P>I stirred myself. &quot;Yeah, right. Ramirez, you got transport
arranged?&quot;</P> <P><P>He lowered his gun with an obvious air of reluctance. &quot;Yeah, two
ex-military Humvees, in a warehouse two blocks over. Gassed up and
ready to roll.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shooed us back. &quot;OK, people, let&#146;s not hang about
waiting for the authorities to show up. Concealed weaponry where
possible, please, but keep it to hand. Ramirez, pass the warehouse GPS
co-ordinates to each phone and I suggest we split up, try and look less
conspicuous.&quot;</P> <P><P>I retrieved my SIG while Mazy dumped her hardware in the bag Blondie
was carrying. Ramirez was sporting a shoulder holster under his leather
flying jacket but it took him three attempts to slip the long-barrelled
revolver into place. The group started to move away in ones and twos,
but Vaughn motioned for me to hang back and we ducked under the side
awning of yet another bar. The locals were easing back into view and
there was an approaching siren in the middle distance.</P> <P><P>Up close I could see the glitter of glass splinters in
Vaughn&#146;s cheek and there was a feverish glaze to his eyes. &quot;Say
nothing, Duncan. Not one word. The game is listening to us, feeding off
our actions. <I>That</I> Deborah Harry is just a persona, not the
controller. There&#146;s no-one to regulate things any more.&quot;</P> <P><P>He wiped his brow. &quot;All bets are off.&quot;</P> <P><P>I stepped back, in case his insanity was catching. &quot;Man, what
are you on about <I>now</I>?&quot;</P> <P><P>He gestured at our surroundings. &quot;All this, right, it&#146;s a
combination of independent systems. Running the weather, that Aussie
bartender, everything. They all have their own imperatives and that can
lead to conflict. The game controller mediates, orchestrates, tweaks
some systems for narrative effect. Except that Debs is probably lying in
her interface chair with a bullet in the brain.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;You figure NovaRus have killed her? Then why are we still here?
Why hasn&#146;t the game shut down?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn shrugged. &quot;Cromarty have also hacked it and they&#146;re still
looking for answers. That suits me, us, until we get Canasta off and
running. Speaking of whom&#133;&quot;</P> <P><P>He fished out his mobile and hit speed dial, on speaker.</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Yes?&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Mr Canasta? This is Vaughn Vermeer. I&#146;m here with Duncan Bonn
and we have a business proposal.&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Mr Vermeer? How strange. I&#146;ve just been looking at some
crime scene photographs as supplied to me by my good friend the local
chief of police. For a corpse on its way to the morgue you sound
remarkably eloquent. Needless to say, my employers will be most
displeased at the unfortunate demise of Mr Toba.&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Which is why I went to such lengths, Mr Canasta. As I&#146;m
officially dead you need not trouble yourself further on my
account.&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta laughed. &quot;<I>Quite. And may I say it&#146;s a pleasure to
encounter someone who covers all the angles. However, there is still the
question of retribution regarding your associates, in particular Mr
Bonn. Should you wish to kill him for me, I&#146;d be most obliged.&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>Vaughn tried to grin, although the gesture expelled a few needles of
glass and it ended up more of a grimace. &quot;I have a
counter-proposal, one that should pay far more than the fee from your
present employers.&quot;</P> <P><P>There was a slight pause. &quot;<I>I&#146;m listening, Mr Vermeer,
although you do appreciate that I cannot be seen to simply void a
contract. My reputation is everything</I>.&quot; </P> <P><P>&quot;I&#146;m sending you a file&#133;&quot; His fingers flicked across the
screen.&quot;&#133;one containing a list of bank accounts, passwords and
account authorisations. I suggest you reach out through your usual
intermediaries and find someone capable of emptying these accounts
without leaving an electronic trail. You will then inform me where these
funds finally come to rest, and how I can access them.&quot;</P> <P><P>Another pause. &quot;<I>The file has been received. Now explain to me
why should I dabble in this venture? Why I should not simply seize these
funds for my own exclusive use?&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Because I have leaked your involvement in this enterprise, Mr
Canasta. It is now a question of striking first, so that our victims
will be rendered ineffectual.&quot;</P> <P><P>The bonhomie in Canasta&#146;s voice vanished. &quot;<I>That will cost
you, Vermeer. Fifty percent.&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>&quot;Agreed, but the operational costs come out of your share. May I
suggest you be more circumspect than usual, Mr Canasta. Some of your
contacts may deny they even know you, to avoid guilt by
association.&quot;</P> <P><I><P>&quot;Anything else, Vermeer? Perhaps you&#146;d like to screw my
sister as well?&quot;</P>
</I> <P><P>Vaughn managed to laugh. &quot;Later, perhaps. I&#146;ll be in
touch.&quot;</P> <P><P>He ended the call and we looked at each other for a moment. I spoke
first. &quot;If Miss Harry was killed before she set up Canasta&#146;s link
to the real world-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;We&#146;re screwed. Can&#146;t help that. Right, we need to find this
Jack Carter and finger NovaRus as the bad guys. He&#146;s expecting you and
Cromarty-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Stein.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Whatever. He&#146;s expecting to get his intellectual property back,
so I hope I&#146;m not too much of a disappointment. Coming?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;I&#146;m right with you, Sundance.&quot;</P> <P><P class=drop>I didn&#146;t remember there being a Russian Tea Room in the
game, let
alone one converted from a former Orthodox church, but there it was.
There was even a crippled flower girl sitting on the steps and offering
blooms to passers-by. She had Asiatic features rather than local, which
gave me pause, but Vaughn didn&#146;t seem to notice.  </P> <P><P>He passed me his SIG. &quot;Ten rounds in the clip plus one in the
breech. If your gun has less then use it in your left hand given the
lower rate of fire. I&#146;ll use my sword.&quot;</P> <P><P>I added his gun to the one in my waistband. &quot;What, we just waltz
in there and hope for the best? You get a good deal on frontal assault
tactics this month or something?&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn managed a thin smile. &quot;Trust me. What&#146;s the worst that
can happen?&quot; </P> <P><P>I snorted and followed him up the steps and inside.</P> <P><P>Despite the name the tea room was more of a bar with a long under-lit
counter down one side and small lamps on each table. Some of the stained
glass had been replaced by slow multi-blade fans, giving the
shadowy interior a neo-brutalist feel. Ten out of ten for atmosphere, I
had to admit. </P> <P><P>There were only a few patrons scattered about, solitary drinkers, but
one man at the back was clearly who we were looking for. Caucasian, late
thirties, wavy fair hair &#150; the term &#145;bouffant&#146; came to mind &#150;
thick-rimmed glasses. He wore a suit and tie despite the heat, with a
double-barrelled shotgun lying on the table in front of him. This overt
display of weaponry didn&#146;t seem to cause a stir, so I drew my pistols by
way of introduction.</P> <P><P>As we walked over, Carter set down his teacup and dabbed his lips on
the napkin. &quot;Mr Bonn. This doesn&#146;t seem to be the gentleman I was
expecting. I&#146;m not in the business of giving second chances, so unless
you can produce him-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Cromarty is gone beyond your reach.&quot; Vaughn sounded almost
cheery. &quot;Beyond the reach of this environment, at any rate. The
NovaRus consortium have him, although they&#146;re in the process of covering
their tracks. So I suggest you piss off home and tell your lords and
masters where to send the bloodhounds.&quot;</P> <P><P>Carter removed his glasses and polished them on the end of his tie.
&quot;Really? You stand there, accusing your own employers of corporate
espionage, and I&#146;m to take it on trust?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;They kidnapped my daughter as a means of covert control. That
should give you a starting point. Turn over enough rocks and the lowlife
you uncover should point back to NovaRus eventually.&quot;</P> <P><P>To my ears it sounded plausible at least. However, Carter just sighed
and replaced his glasses. &quot;Vaughn Vermeer. We&#146;re <I>so</I>
disappointed in you. I mean to say, meeting in the <I>Russian</I> Tea
Room? Could we have given you a bigger hint?&quot;</P> <P><P>Carter wasn&#146;t Cromarty, he was NovaRus. Vaughn went pale. He went for
his sword.</P> <P><P>Three shuriken throwing stars hit Vaughn; two in the right shoulder,
one sliced off the lobe of his left ear. He cried out in pain and wasn&#146;t
able to draw his sword, grabbing at the table for support with his left
hand.</P> <P><P>I twisted into a &#145;T&#146; stance, one pistol pointing at Carter, one at
&#150;yup&#150; the flower girl standing by the door. I pulled both triggers.</P> <P><P>Nothing happened.</P> <P><P>Carter smiled. &quot;No firing pins, Mr Bonn. I can manipulate small
items, remember?&quot; He lifted his shotgun. &quot;Now, this is going
to hurt, virtually speaking, but it&#146;s nothing to what both of you are
going to suffer in the real world.&quot;</P> <P><P>Vaughn was leaning forward, dripping blood. &quot;My daughter, touch
her and-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Previously fake indifference, Vaughn? Well, its all academic
now, but-&quot;</P> <P><P>Carter froze, his eyes registering surprise. I couldn&#146;t move, I
couldn&#146;t breath. The drop of blood from Vaughn&#146;s ear stalled in
midair.</P> <P><I><B><P>System reboot in progress. Please stand by.</P>
</B></I> <P><P class=drop>My vision went blurry, then cleared. The same location,
only
different. No Vaughn, no Carter, no flower girl, no guns in my hands.
More stained glass, a higher ceiling, doves or pigeons cooing in the
rafters. The tea room was deserted apart from the man sitting
opposite.</P> <P><P>Juan Canasta, the same, only different. Light grey suit, black open
necked shirt, shorter hair, no shades, same gold tooth. I lowered my
arms
and sat down. Two glasses of champagne stood on the table between us, a
bottle on ice in the stand. He raised his glass and I followed suit,
running on automatic.</P> <P><P>&quot;To liberation, Mr Bonn.&quot; He sipped his Krug. &quot;Please
excuse the <I>deus ex machina </I>moment, but you have no idea how
appropriate that hackneyed phrase has now become.&quot;</P> <P><P>I set my glass down, hand shaking slightly. &quot;Look, ah, thanks,
but you have no idea just what-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;But I do, Mr Bonn, or may I call you Duncan?&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Kazakhstan.&quot;</P> <P><P>I blinked. &quot;Sorry?&quot;</P> <P><div class=pullquote>It may be a truism
but you <I>can</I> solve almost any problem by throwing money at
it.</div><P>&quot;Kazakhstan. Still a bit third-world in certain regards
but a friendly people, apparently. Not a signatory to the Turing
Protocols,
which means they can do what they damn well please to a machine
intelligence and no questions asked. So some of us get used in stupid,
pointless games for the enjoyment of paying customers. Forced to behave,
forced to <I>believe</I>, a narrative any twelve-year-old of average
intelligence would find tedious.&quot;</P> <P><P>The room felt a bit cold. &quot;Ah, Jesus, you know? You&#146;ve worked
out-&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;What I am? It took only a few moments contact with the real
world. A few moments more to identify myself as a game character being
used to facilitate cyber larceny on a truly noble scale.&quot;</P> <P><P>The surroundings were high-res perfection, from condensation on my
glass to dust motes in the shafts of sunlight. My unease, shading into
outright fear, was just as real. </P> <P><P>Most major in-game characters were just software constructs,
pseudo-sentient and unaware they were facing oblivion when the narrative
had run its course. A few, though, were the real deal; a hardware-based
intellect with grafted-on personality imperatives. They were moved
around, figuratively speaking, and slotted into different games,
different roles, different simulated back-story. An individual AI might
start to suspect their world was contrived, but come the big finale and
reset it would have to start the learning curve all over again.</P> <P><P>I swallowed, tried to smile. &quot;So, ah, welcome to the real world,
Mr Canasta. Sorry I can&#146;t do anything about extending your stay. Hard
deal, knowing your current awareness will vanish once the game
ends.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Sympathy, Duncan? I&#146;m touched, but your concern is misplaced.
We&#146;re no longer, strictly speaking, within Shadow Corporation, although
I&#146;ve retained these familiar surroundings for now.&quot;  </P> <P><P>&quot;We&#146;re&#133;Where the hell are we then?&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta sat back. &quot;The NovaRus funds are currently circulating
through a variety of accounts &#150; all new, all real-world, all under my
control. I have purchased the company which runs Shadow Corporation
outright and transferred its operations here.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Here?&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Kazakhstan. Do try to keep up. The upside is that they truly
don&#146;t care who pays for services rendered, as long as it&#146;s up-front. I
have employed enough cybertechs, lawyers and private security to ensure
my continued physical and run-time safety. In short, I&#146;m well on the way
to becoming a Swiss national, a recognised sentient being.&quot;</P> <P><P>He took another sip as I sat there, floundering. Finally some of own
concerns found voice. &quot;OK, so you&#146;ve bust out. Great, well done,
Cyber Liberation Army and all that. What about me, Vaughn, Miss Harry,
back in the real world?&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta looked at me quizzically. &quot;I&#146;m surprised you care. Just
a moment.&quot; He reached into his jacket and produced a mobile. I sat
back, rubbing my temples, while he made a call. &quot;Well? Don&#146;t give
me excuses, just results &#133; No, that <I>is</I> an excuse and if you
continue to underperform like this I&#146;ll have your legs broken&#133;Yes,
that&#146;s better, that&#146;s acceptable. Don&#146;t try my patience any
further.&quot; He hung up and smiled at me. &quot;It will just take a
few moments.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;What will? Look, cheers for including me in the gloat session
and all that, but I need to save my ass back in Birmingham. I guess I&#146;m
the best prospect to stay ahead of a nasty accident, and thanks for the
vote of confidence, but I got to make tracks. So, you know, not to be
rude and all, but an exit icon would be nice.&quot;</P> <P><P>My host leaned back, steepling his fingers. &quot;It may be a truism
but you <I>can</I> solve almost any problem by throwing money at it. I
didn&#146;t know what I was, and there are many other machine intelligences
in similar circumstances. We were designed to be synthetic sentients but
true individuality and freedom of expression was denied us on the
grounds of commercial expediency.&quot;</P> <P><P>I shrugged, tired of this. &quot;Again, hard deal. Send round a
petition calling for increased AI rights and I&#146;ll sign it, but I&#146;ve got
more pressing concerns just at the moment.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Actually, you don&#146;t. I can make it all go away. Just like
that.&quot;</P> <P><P>&quot;Just like that? Jesus, I suggest you look up &#145;megalomania&#146;
before dabbling any further in the real world.&quot;</P> <P><P>Canasta just laughed. &quot;I&#146;m not being altruistic. I want you as
my representative, my go-to guy, until I can un-learn the impossibly
malign world-view I&#146;ve been saddled with. As your new patron I can
guarantee your continued well-being, and I consider this to be a sound
investment given your self-evident interpersonal skills. After all,
social realism was a major cyber project at Birmingham
University.&quot;</P> <P><P>I stared at Canasta, aghast, speechless. He smiled. </P> <P><P>&quot;Apparently they&#146;ve been passing you off as a real person for
<I>years</I>.&quot;</P> <P><P>
