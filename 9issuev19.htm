<div><i><b>"Death comes equally to us all, and makes us all equal when
it
comes."</b><br><small>John Donne</small></i>
<p class="drop">I followed Three Witches down the side
street, keeping to the shadows. It was one of those damp nights where
street lighting served merely to define the darkness rather than provide
illumination - which suited me just fine. They disappeared into the side
entrance of the Cologne Club and as the door opened I caught a brief
burst of the Halloween revels within. Franco Jacoby ran all the major
nightclub action in the Lower East Side and his seasonal-themed parties
were legendary. Tonight, for whatever reason, he&#146;d gone for armed
security over his regular door-minder muscle, contracting out the deal
via a range of intermediaries. So there I was; armed and definitely
dangerous, in fancy dress. </p> <p>A black cat paused in the process of
crossing my path to give me the full hiss-and-glare treatment. Some wise
sage once said cats can see what lies behind your eyes, so felines
really have a downer on me - but I&#146;m used to it by now. It stood its
ground so I ducked under a ladder propped against the side of Dobson&#146;s
Depository, knowing it wouldn&#146;t follow. You may think all this comes
under the heading of &#145;Old Wives Tales&#146; but, trust me, it all depends on
which old wife you listen to.</p> <P><p>The young woman on the door looked tasty; all ankle-length coat,
cropped black hair and inset mirrored shades. Light
rain made her black leather shimmer like liquid glass under the neon
&#145;CC&#146; sign. I recognised her as Amy Chandler &#150; but then again, I know
everyone. </p> <P><p>Amy stiffened as I stepped into a pool of light, so I slid back my
hood to give her a clear look at my face. Her stance relaxed slightly
and she laughed. &#147;Stevens? I heard you were dead. I know you can never
have too much firepower but this is getting ridiculous.&#148; She eyed my
hoodie and cargo pants, shaking her head, &#147;What have you come as anyway?
A modern take on Little Jack Horner?&#148;</p> <P><p>I held my arms out at shoulder height and gave her a slow pirouette.
&#147;Justin Timberlake, <i>actually</i>. In full-blown slasher movie mode,
circa Cry Me A River. Anyway, you&#146;re one to talk with this whole Matrix
thing you&#146;ve got going.&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy came over all mock-huffy. &#147;It&#146;s a William Gibson homage,
<i>actually</i>. You know, Molly from Neuromancer?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Whatever. Look, doll, who else is in on this? The details I have are
a bit sketchy and they said you&#146;d fill me in. All I know is it&#146;s a
bodyguard gig.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Well, more a kind of private army. We&#146;ve got Suzy-Sue and Grumman
round front, Bain and Akira inside as close protection.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Christ, that&#146;s some serious talent! Who&#146;s this guy afraid of?
Godzilla?&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy pursed her lips. &#147;Death.&#148;</p> <P><p>I blinked. Twice. &#147;Excuse me?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Franco Jacoby thinks there&#146;s someone coming to kill him, and they&#146;re
gonna&#146; come dressed as Death.&#148;</p> <P><p>I shook my head. &#147;So why not just cancel the party? A refund has to
work out cheaper than hiring our little band of desperados.&#148;</p> <P><p>She shook her head. &#147;Naw, it&#146;s a machismo thing. Nobody tries to
muscle-in on Jacoby &#145;cos he&#146;s our own little Keyser Soze - a real shark
amongst sharks. No way can he afford to appear scared or it would be
like blood in the water. Luckily for us he&#146;s paranoid about being
betrayed by a member of his own crew, so we got the gig.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;But why just tonight? If there&#146;s a contract out then I don&#146;t see how
delaying the hit for a few hours will matter any.&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy frowned. &#147;To tell you the truth this whole thing may be a
complete waste of time. Apparently Jacoby gets like this every
Halloween, like it&#146;s some kind of family ritual. Talk about inherited
superstition, his father must have been a real weirdo.&#148;</p> <P><p>I wiped slick rain from my face. &#147;So what you&#146;re telling me, and feel
free to jump right in anytime if I&#146;ve gotten hold of the wrong end of
the stick, is that we&#146;re standing here to stop an imaginary assassin
killing a vicious crime lord who&#146;s jumping at shadows?&#148;</p> <P><p>She nodded. &#148;Pretty much. To tell you the truth, Stevens, Jacoby must
be off his head. If he didn&#146;t have such a reputation I&#146;d have stayed at
home in front of the TV. As it stands he&#146;s not someone I want to piss
off.&#148;</p> <P><p>I took up position beside her. &#147;No lie.&#148; She fished a spare earpiece
and lapel microphone from her coat and handed them over. Just as well I
had lapels. I plugged in and squeezed the mic to open the channel.
&#147;Radio check. You all hearing me?&#148; Amy nodded.</p> <P><p><i>&#147;Stevens, you little shit, that really you? Heard you was lying
low for the foreseeable. Heard you had a serious beef with Danny O for
screwing his kid sister.&#148;</i> </p> <P><p>I recognised the gravel-throated growl of Donald Bain (who never got
the joke). &#147;I love you too, Don. Let&#146;s just say me and Danny came to a
resolution he&#146;s happy with.&#148;</p> <P><p>Suzy-Sue laughed. <i>&#147;If this means wedding bells then I just got to
be there. Your side of the church will be packing more firepower than
Omaha Beach.&#148;</i></p> <P><p><i>&#147;Enough already! Everyone get back on the clock.&#148;</i> That was
Grumman. The guy must be fifty if he&#146;s a day and always comes over like
he&#146;s in charge whenever gunmen get together.</p> <P><p>Amy arched an eyebrow, which made her wince. &#147;You making an honest
woman of Tina <em>O'Shaughnessy</em>, Tony? Say it ain&#146;t so.&#148;</p> <P><p>I shrugged and had the good grace to look semi-uncomfortable. &#147;It&#146;s
not what you think.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;It never is.&#148; She smiled and shifted her stance slightly. Her foot
brushed against a small bag I hadn&#146;t noticed before, producing the soft
<i>clink</i> of glass.</p> <P><p>&#147;Boozing on the job, Amy? Or when we knock-off don&#146;t you fancy paying
bar prices inside?&#148;</p> <P><p>She glanced down. &#147;Naw, it&#146;s a broken mirror. Didn&#146;t you get one
through the mail from Jacoby? The rest of us did.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;A broken mirror? What the hell are you on about now?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;As in seven years bad luck for the poor schmuck who originally broke
it? But luck is like, you know, air &#150; there&#146;s only so much to go around.
So to screw with the intended the mirror has to suck in bad luck from
those in the immediate vicinity. Loads of gamblers and gunmen carry
glass. Don&#146;t you know <i>anything</i>?&#148;</p> <P><p>I grinned and shook my head. &#147;Apparently not. Well, our Franco sounds
like he&#146;s a few aces short of a pack.&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy snorted. &#147;Yeah, well, you can laugh but there&#146;s a space reserved
for us in Fresh Kills if we fuck this up, so I for one will take any
help going.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;I hear ya, doll, I hear ya. But ending up as Staten Island landfill
wasn&#146;t what I had in mind for this body, if it&#146;s all the same to
you.&#148;</p> <P><p>We stood like mismatched statues on either side of the entrance to a
particular tatty tomb. As nothing was happening in the street I took a
quick look around. &#147;Why is there a line of white powder across the
doorway?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Salt. There&#146;s a shaker in the corner should we need to re-establish
the barrier if it gets scuffed.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Huh?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;You know, its proof against, against&#133;&#148; Her voice trailed away in
obvious embarrassment, &#147;It was on the sheet.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Along with the broken mirror that I didn&#146;t get?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Screw you.&#148;</p> <P><p>An awkward silence descended. We stood. I cleared my throat. &#147;Those
mirror shades, they stuck on?&#148;</p> <P><p>She sounded relieved to discuss something other than our situation.
&#147;Yeah, not my best idea. They itch like a bitch.&#148;</p> <P><p>There was another silence. The rain continued to fall. I hitched up
my pants as the twin .38 revolvers in the thigh pockets were hanging
heavy. A dispute broke out amongst some crows nesting in the Depository
clock tower. Maybe they were jumping about on the mechanism but it
suddenly chimed once, although everyone knew it got busted years ago.
The domestic spilled out in a flurry of wings and bad-tempered cawing. A
cluster of six crows swept down and along the street, passing close
enough I could have reached out and snagged one. The avian shouting
match faded away into the gloom.</p> <P><p>Amy fished something out of her coat pocket and started fiddling with
it. She looked twitchy. &#147;Six crows. That&#146;s bad luck. Means someone is
for the chop.&#148;</p> <P><p>I laughed. &#147;Only if we do our job right. What <i>is</i> that you&#146;ve
got anyway?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;An acorn. Brings good luck.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Say what? You&#146;re not superstitious.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Tonight I am.&#148; She crammed the nut back into her pocket. &#147;Just leave
it, OK?&#148;</p> <P><p>We stood some more. Way in the distance a dog howled. I got bored.
For something to do I turned and checked the guest list on a clipboard
hanging inside the recessed doorway. &#147;Amy, you looked at this?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Not as such. It&#146;s only for those who turn up without tickets, and
they generally make a grand entrance round front.&#148; A wary note crept
into her voice. &#147;Why?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Its here, right down at the bottom - &#145;Death plus one&#146;. A
hand-written addition.&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy licked her lips in what I knew to be an uncharacteristic display
of nervousness. &#147;Bullshit. Is this your idea of a joke?&#148;</p> <P><p>I held out the clipboard. &#147;See for yourself.&#148;</p> <P><p>She leaned forward. &#147;It&#146;s still bullshit. I&#146;m telling ya, Tony,
Jacoby is loony-tunes paranoid tonight and the club is like Fort Knox.
Every window has been bricked up, every chimney sealed. The only way in
is through one of us.&#148;</p> <P><p>Movement further down the street caught my attention. I pointed, she
looked. There were two figures approaching, briefly illuminated by each
street light as they walked towards us. One looked like a tall dude,
basketball tall, in a long robe with cowl, face hidden, carrying a
scythe over his shoulder. Beside him was a pale-skinned girl in a
blood-soaked wedding dress, her throat slashed wide open.</p> <P><p>Amy shook her head. &#147;Death and The Maiden? You have <i>got</i> to be
kidding me.&#148;</p> <P><p>As we watched the couple paused briefly then The Maiden headed off
down an alleyway in the direction of Regency. Death watched her go then
started towards us again. It was just an optical illusion but it looked
like the rain parted and fell either side of the scythe blade, as if it
were keen enough to cleave the very air itself.</p> <P><p>I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. &#147;Okey-dokey. Let&#146;s not get
ahead of ourselves here. Say she&#146;s gone to score an ATM or liquor store
while he heads inside to get in line for the buffet. Hell, they might
not even be guests at this particular party.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;You really think that, Tony? Really?&#148; My partner squared her
shoulders. &#147;I say we take no chances. I say we off him, no questions
asked.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;No way. This has to be a guest.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Yes way, bro. Jacoby holds this party every Halloween, never missed
a year since ever, and the invites stipulate absolutely no Death
costumes. Anything else you might fancy, but not that.&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Shit, you can&#146;t just kill someone for not reading the small print.
Anyway, I figure <i>this</i> dude is on the guest list.&#148; I tossed the
clipboard aside and stepped out in front of the Grim Reaper, hands
raised. &#147;Excuse me, pal, but-&#148;</p> <P><p>The scythe went one way, a glittering distraction, Death another. He
spun, robes flying wide, and kicked me in the chest. A solid hit, one
that sent me sprawling on my back, hands clawing at the thigh pockets of
my cargo pants. He leapt into the air, paused in a slo-mo moment, and
came down - his heel aimed at my throat.</p> <P><p>I tore both .38&#146;s free and started firing, nailing him multiple times
in the chest. The impacts seemed to dissipate his momentum and he
dropped short, landing at my feet, taking hit after hit without
reaction.</p> <P><p>Both my revolvers clicked empty.</p> <P><p>Death shook himself and a cluster of spent rounds dropped to the
ground. He laughed; not a dry-as-dust cackle, but a rich, basso profundo
chuckle that somehow sounded more unsettling. I scrabbled in the dirt,
trying to push myself away, but my shoulders came up against a wheeled
trash bin and I was trapped. He towered over me, the very picture of
inhuman fatality.</p> <P><p>&#147;Hey, dickhead.&#148; Amy sounded wired, brittle, high on violence.</p> <P><p>He half turned towards the voice.</p> <P><p>&#147;Eat this!&#148;</p> <P><p>A shotgun roared, real loud in the narrow street, echoing off the
walls. Death took it full in the face. His cowl vanished in a blizzard
of shredded cloth and blood. He fell back in a bloody sprawl and lay
still.</p> <P><p>My saviour stepped up, her long coat now flapping open, holding a
pump-action Mossberg 500 with pistol grip. Amy kept the prone figure
covered while I got to my feet and peered down at what remained of the
body. I frowned. &#147;He had a face? How can Death have a face? Isn&#146;t he
supposed to be, you know, just bones?&#148;</p> <P><p>Amy shrugged. &#147;Beats me, bro. Here, hold this while I finish things
off.&#148; She tossed me the shotgun which I managed to catch and not drop.
Fishing inside her vest top she produced a big medallion, with five
spiky corners, slipping the chain over her head.</p> <P><p>I laughed, sounding nervous. &#147;Didn&#146;t know you were into that kind of
mojo, doll.&#148;</p> <P><p>She crouched down and started scratching out a pentagram around the
body, the medallion leaving deep lines in the tarmac. &#147;Doesn&#146;t matter
what I believe, bro. According to our employer this will keep him safe
for another year and I&#146;m not going to argue.&#148;</p> <P><p>I kept watch while she shuffled around the body, completing the
occult symbol. None of the other hired help came to our aid and I didn&#146;t
expect them to. They&#146;d keep station in case the gunfire was just a
diversion. The club soundproofing was primo so the revellers would be
none the wiser about our little fracas.</p> <P><p>Amy sat back on her haunches. &#147;There, done. Now I place this
whatever-it-is on his chest and we can make tracks. Don&#146;t sweat about
the police showing up, Jacoby has paid them to stay well away tonight.&#148;
She tossed the medallion onto the corpse which landed with a metallic
<i>click</i>.</p> <P><p>We looked at each other. I shrugged. She frowned and reached forward
to move a fold of robe aside. &#147;Body armour? What the hell does Death
need with body armour?&#148;</p> <P><p>I chambered another round, the <i>rak-rak</i> sounding harsh - and
final. Amy jumped to her feet, hand clawing for the Glock on her hip,
and I shot her square in the chest. The short-range impact spun her
around before she collapsed in an ungainly heap.</p> <P><p>There was a silence as if the world held its breath.</p> <P><p>Franco Jacoby was seriously twisted, and then some. Every Halloween
he took out an anonymous contract on <i>himself</i>, stipulating it had
to take place at the Cologne Club. You pay enough money and even a
hardened killer will wear a pink tutu and whistle &#145;Dixie&#146; while blowing
someone away. </p> <P><p>Or in this case, turn up dressed like the Grim Reaper, complete with
scythe.</p> <P><p>The hit man had to have a proven track record; he had to be someone
who&#146;d killed multiple times before. Same went for the bodyguards Jacoby
hired &#150; all people on first-name terms with Death. Every Halloween
someone died, and every Halloween a clean-up crew made it like nothing
happened.</p> <P><p>This year, though, was different. Jacoby&#146;s daughter had just turned
21 and now needed &#145;protection&#146; as well. Well, that&#146;s what her father
believed and you can&#146;t argue with a sick mind. So I was the ringer
brought in to ensure that <i>two</i> corpses ended up in the pentagram,
by any means necessary. </p> <P><p>I heard high-heels and turned to face The Maiden &#150; a.k.a. the love of
my life, Tina O'Shaughnessy. She stared at the faceless Death for a
moment, then spat on the corpse. &#147;Bastard. I hope you rot in Hell,
Danny.&#148;</p> <P><p>As epitaphs go maybe her brother deserved better, but I&#146;ve
learned never to get between family. Except, of course, on this occasion
I had; Danny O had a downer on me and Tina from the get-go, end of
story. I couldn&#146;t do nothing as he was a Made Man with the Scharlach
family - and even if we&#146;d just skipped town it wouldn&#146;t have ended
there. </p> <P><p>So I got him the Jacoby gig, moonlighting as Death, with Amy as
the designated target. Now, OK, I&#146;d planned to pop him once he dropped
her, but his double-cross still <i>hurt</i>, man. Seriously. It&#146;s a sad
reflection on society when you can&#146;t trust a hired killer.</p> <P><p>I pressed my lapel mic. &#147;Splash one Zero&#133;and one friendly. We&#146;re
clear.&#148; Nobody answered; everybody knew the risks that came with a gig
like this. I handed Tina the shotgun. &#147;This won&#146;t take a minute, doll,
then we&#146;re free and clear.&#148;</p> <P><p>Tina had grown up in the life and this wasn&#146;t her first multiple
murder. She chambered a fresh round and stood, hand on hip, as I dragged
Amy on top of the other body. From an inside pocket I took a hip flask
and poured the contents onto the scored tarmac. It flowed more like
thick oil than regular booze and smelled like cinnamon. Jacoby had
supplied it and no way was I taking a sip to find out if it was actually
alcoholic. It took almost a minute to mark out the pentagram with lines
that shimmered like quicksilver under the halogen streetlight. </p> <P><p>I stepped back, fished out a book of matches, struck one and
tossed it. Pale blue flames flared up, burned for less than five
seconds, and were gone like someone turned the gas off. I stood back and
wiped rain from my face. </p> <P><p>Tina sniffed. &#147;We cool?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;We&#146;re cool. Some unknown guy shows up and gets the drop on Amy.
I open fire but he&#146;s wearing body armour, the real deal. But the impacts
make him stagger back, he drops the shotgun. I get to it first
and&#133;&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Goodnight, Vienna.&#148; She nodded. &#147;You never saw his face, you
never realised who it was.&#148;</p> <P><p>I grinned. &#147;Nope. No idea.&#148;</p> <P><p>She kissed me, careful not to get fake blood on my clothes, and
handed back the Mossberg. &#147;Call me.&#148;</p> <P><p>I watched as she faded into the shadows; trying for a bit of
bump-and-grind but she doesn&#146;t have the hips for it. Then I switched the
microphone to channel 2. &#147;Mister Jacoby? This is Stevens. You can send
in that clean-up crew anytime now.&#148;</p> <P><p>A rasping drawl. &#147;It&#146;s done? Two bodies?&#148;</p> <P><p>&#147;Yes, sir-&#148; The Depository bell tolled twice, making me pause. I
cleared my throat.</p> <P><p>&#147;Death plus one.&#148;</p> <P> <P><small>&copy;  Martin M. Clark 2017 All Rights Reserved <br>
