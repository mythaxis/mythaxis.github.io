<div><i>"The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be
the philosophy of government in the next." <small> Abraham
Lincoln</small></i>
<p class=drop>Tazio slid the long card into the wall slot.
A
multicoloured ribbon cable led from the card to Tazio's handheld device.
LEDs flashed. A	dull click came from the depths of the white door, and
after a pause, accompanied by a sigh of long-unused hydraulics and a
crack of silicone
seals, the door slid open a few centimetres, checked briefly, then
retracted into the wall of the corridor. For a fifteen year-old kid,
Tazio
was good with keys. Good with electronics generally. <P>A waft of cold, sharply-flavoured air, smelling faintly of plastic and
light oil, issued from the dark space beyond. The air in these pods was
somehow refreshing. Only whenever he returned to the main ship did he
realise that the Mustang Sally always smelled like a latrine. Yet none
of the fifty thousand inhabitants of the star ship were particularly
aware of it. The aroma was a side-effect of the constant requirement to
recycle everything... absolutely everything. <P>Fluorescent tubes buzzed and blinked, illuminating a white corridor. A
mushroom-shaped button was flashing just inside. With ease born of
practice, Tazio retrieved his home-made access card, and entered. He
struck
the button, and the door behind him slid shut. Motors hummed, his ears
popped, then the door at the far end of the corridor clicked, and a
green light came on above it. Tazio trotted to the door, which was
labelled
'Mustang Sally Pod K6', pulled a lever and pushed the door open. He
stepped into the brightly-illuminated space beyond. The room was crowded
with white-cased machinery, black acceleration couches, brushed
stainless steel controls, and inert display panels. He turned and pushed
the door closed, then popped open a nearby panel in the floor and
flipped a switch off. The main lights went out, leaving only the faint
red glow of emergency lamps and LEDs. <P><div
class=pullquote>"You don't have to break into a landing pod to see the
view."</div>At the far end of the pod, a circular transparent blister of
thick glass
would offer a pod pilot a forward view on landing. Currently, it was
covered on the outside with a protective iris, so that it would not
become eroded by exposure to possible particles of dust. Moving quickly,
Tazio attached his Gripsafe camera mount to a convenient grab bar in the
viewport, attached the camera, an ancient Panasonic that had belonged to
his grandmother, and verified that it could be pointed in any direction. <P>He pressed the switch to open the viewport cover, and, as usual,
experienced a thrill of vertigo at the depth of space. Despite the size
of Mustang Sally, the longest internal views were measured in hundreds
of metres, rather than light years. He pressed the video start button to
make a test.
 
Tazio was currently invading a landing pod destined to be used for the
first time in some 190 years. His grandchildren's descendants might one
day pilot a landing pod. Until then, the pods were strictly out of
bounds. <P>Starting the second scan, with the camera turning on the automatic drive
he had built, Tazio felt, rather than heard, a whisper of air movement,
and
the lights went on, dazzling him temporarily with the reflection from
the curved viewport. <P>In the doorway behind him stood a compact woman in uniform. Kay-Zee
Jones - specifically Master-at-Arms Jones - with whom Tazio was,
regrettably, all too familiar. <P>Brazened it out: "Hi, Kay-Zee, switch off that light, will you? I'm just
working on my astrophysics project." <P>"You know you're not allowed in here. How did you get in, anyway?" <P>"Door was open." <P>"These doors are never open, and you know it. What have you touched?
Other than two airlock doors, light switches and the viewport cover
plate, that is." <P>"Nothing! Just fixed up the camera here, see?" <P>"Right. Close the viewport and let's go. Why do I keep finding you in
areas you're not supposed to be in? I'm taking you to the Lieutenant
this time." <P>Tazio considered making a protest, but he decided it would be safer to
obey orders and hope for leniency. Detached the equipment and followed
her meekly from the landing pod. Hoping that no-one would conficate his
access card. It'd take a month to scrounge the parts for another. <P>"Why are you in here? And in the dark?"  <P>"To photograph the stars. I use the viewport." <P>"You don't have to break into a landing pod for that. You can get an
accurate image of the stars from the nav database, adjusted for our
speed, accessible from your cabin screen. What's the real reason?" <P>"Yes, I know, but the actual stars themselves are more interesting." <P>"How can they be? They're just dots of light. Anyway, you don't have to
break into a landing pod to see the view." <P>"I do. There aren't any viewports anywhere else." <P>He was right. There were no viewports on the main hull of the ship. It
had been considered bad for morale to allow the crew to see the void
around them. Automatic machinery checked star positions continuously and
made microscopic course corrections, without the need for crew
involvement. When necessary, navigation officers might engage one of the
external cameras if the on-board computers warned of nearby dust or
debris. <P>"You've been into other pods, haven't you?" she said. <P>"One or two." There were dozens of landing pods attached to the vast
interstellar ship, each with a viewport. Tazio had visited many of them,
taking his photographs and videos. The landing pods, being set at
different angles on Mustang Sally's kilometres-long network of
cylinders, offered different views, and Tazio had photographed the
starscape from each pod he had visited. <P>"Come here. Let's go." <P>

You could be right, but I can't see inside. They built those ships to
last. The hull is mostly thick ferrous metal. They had no force field
technology when Mustang Sally set sail. All I can say is that the
engines are still running and the temperature of the hull is consistent
with human life. It normally shows no lights at all, but I just saw
lights going off and on inside what must be a lifeboat or something. I
showed myself nearby, but nothing much happened since. By the way, they
launched a missile a while ago, but it may have been an auto intended to
vaporise inconveniently large rocks in their path.</tt> <P><hr />

<hr /> <P><p class=drop>Rather than call an auto-b'n'w, Kay-Zee decided it would
be quicker to walk along corridor K until they were below Patrol HQ, and
then use the companionway. She set off briskly, pulling Tazio by one
arm. He protested and dragged his heels at first, but the pain
occasioned by Kay-Zee insisting on her own pace persuaded him to trot to
keep up. <P>"Why are you called Kay-Zee?" he asked. She ignored this attempt at
conversation. Tazio stumbled as they crossed the area of warped corridor
floor where enthusiastic officers had tried, unsuccessfully, to
incinerate one of Turner's 'dwarves'. <P>"Keep up!" she snapped, irritated with her parents, once again, for
having frivolously named her after a 20th century movie actress,
Katherine Zeta Jones, for heaven's sake. "What sort of a name is Tazio,
anyway?" <P>"My father named me after a twentieth century motor racer called Tazio
Nuvolari." <P>Annoyed as she was, Kay-Zee would probably have carried out her threat
to take Tazio before her superior officer, for the kid's own sake, if
for no other reason. He was running wild. Tazio's mother was dead, his
father was desperately busy, with countless responsibilities. Mustang
Sally was basically an unarmed passenger ship, though under military
command, but it was still bristling with levers, switches, handles and
buttons that could cause all sorts of trouble for law-enforcement and
danger to curious kids like Tazio. A day or two in 'irons' (actually a
cabin that locked from the outside, most usually used for brawlers fired
up on illicit alcohol) might do him a favour. <P>As it happened, that possibly laudable objective went by the board when
her communicator buzzed in her ear. "Yes!" she almost shouted. <P>"Where are you, Kay-Zee?" Lieutenant Parsons. <P>"Corridor K, five minutes from HQ, sir." <P>"OK. I'm sending an auto-b'n'w now. What're you doing?" <P>"Bringing in a juvenile." <P>"Surprise me. Tazio again?" <P>"You got it." <P>"OK. Release him for the time being. You can always re-arrest him. He's
not going anywhere. Suspicious death in storage bay 17. Holt's in
charge. Attend." <P>"I hear you. I'll let him go." <P>Tazio was smirking. He had overheard everything. Kay-Zee glared back,
"Keep your nose clean, kid. Final warning." <P>The black and white autocab was beside them now. Kay-Zee pulled open the
cab door, temporarily transforming the huge POLICE label on the
vehicle's side to LICE.  "Can I come too?" asked Tazio. <P>"Get lost!" she said, attempting to slam the lightweight plastic door,
which failed to make the satisfyingly loud noise she would have liked,
but simply clicked anticlimactically. <P>When she arrived at the entrance to Bay 17, Lazarski was standing
outside the closed doors. His hair and uniform were wet. Lazarski didn't
address her. He called Holt on his comm unit, and Holt came out looking
shaken, which wasn't like him. He was wet, too, his uniform showing dark
patches. Holt wasn't telling her anything either. He assigned Kay-Zee to
"Move Along, Nothing To See Here" duties in the corridor outside, and
went back in with Lazarski. They exchanged a few quiet words. She heard
Holt say "They're not going to believe this." <P>Kay-Zee was irritated at the secrecy, and at the menial duty she'd been
given. People seemed to have heard that the death was 'suspicious'. A
cluster of the curious chatted quietly nearby.  Death was not unusual on
the ship. There were tens of thousands of crew on the Mustang Sally.
Three or four people died every day, mostly retired crew members taking
voluntary euthanasia, tidily. A few suicides, not so tidily. The
remainder were diseases of old age, accidents, fatal victims of fights
and family violence. She guessed this must be an unsightly bizarre
accident that Holt wanted to protect her from, which was both courteous
and insulting. <P>Tazio joined the spectators remarkably soon after Kay-Zee's arrival.
"What's happening, Kay-Zee?" <P>"None of your business. Go home and try to stay out of trouble for an
hour or two." <P>After twenty minutes or so, an auto-ambulance arrived. She called Holt.
Holt told her to send it away. "What's going on?" she asked. <P>"OK. Come in here and lock the doors behind you." <P>The bay was brightly lit. It was a storage-only bay, and very cold.
There was a strong smell of burning, and the floor was wet. Holt and
Lazarski were standing talking. She could see the lower half of a body
lying on the floor. It appeared to be dressed in a yellow overall. <P>"OK? Up here. Holt led the way up an iron ladder to the second level.
Lazarski followed. On
the floor was a bundle of yellow clothes, but a photographer was in the
way. <P>"What..?" <P>Lazarski said: "Don't go getting sick. It's not real." <P>"It's real enough," corrected Holt. "It's just not human. It's an
android. Sliced neatly in half, one on each level. No blood, just wires,
plastic and this jelly stuff, which stinks when it catches fire, by the
way. The top half was trying to talk when we got here, but it's burnt
out now. The smoke detector went off and the door closed, we nearly
choked on carbon dioxide before Jerzy here sprung the entry override and
meanwhile the fire sprinkler got us. Fused the victim." <P>"What did it say?" <P>"Nothing we could understand. Anyway, we're finished here. It's up to
the laboratory to figure it out. It's probably one of their crazy
experiments, anyway. They're on their way." <P>Holt and Lazarski left Kay-Zee guarding the corridor. She let the
photographer out and the lab team in, then Lieutenant Parsons sent a
cadet to
replace her. She wasn't even asked to write a report. <P><p class=drop>When the auto-ambulance was sent away, Tazio had concluded
that nothing interesting was going to happen at Bay 17. He returned to
his cabin to check out the camera footage. <P>His cabin barely offered room for his bed. Cabins for juveniles and
unmarried personnel were a standard three metre cube. The area above his
bunk was covered in a montage of starfield photos, making a composite
image of the visible sphere around the Mustang Sally, lacking only the
view to the rear of the interstellar ship, which was obscured by the
vast engines and the material recycling chambers, and directly ahead,
which was blocked by the debris screen which was intended to stop or
slow up any interstellar matter before it hit the ship proper. <P>The remaining space was crammed from deck to deckhead with equipment.  <P>Tazio was looking for a specific star. A star glimpsed just twice moving
across the field of view. It made no sense. All the other stars, if they
moved perceptibly, moved very slowly backwards with respect to the
ship's motion, because the Mustang Sally was now travelling at a speed
of nearly 30000 kilometres a second, having taken 185 years to achieve
this speed with the relatively tiny but steady acceleration of her
efficient ion drive engines. Shortly, she would rotate, and start to
slow down by pushing in the opposite direction. Then 194 years after
that, she would reach her first port of call - a potentially habitable
planet. The journey was an enterprise of hope, which would take
generations to complete. <P>He downloaded the camera to his computer and viewed the vids. The first
seemed uneventful, but, to be on the safe side, he ran a comparator
program he had written. The program slavishly compared the new vid with
a similar one from a different viewport. A couple of apparent anomalies
turned out to be reflections from the viewport. The star fields, where
they corresponded, were identical, within the limits of camera
resolution. <P>The second vid, the one interrupted by Kay-Zee's arrival, showed a brief
flash just prior to Kay-Zee activating the lights. Tazio initially
attributed that to reflected light from the corridor as Kay-Zee entered,
but, on close inspection, it appeared to occur even before Kay-Zee
opened the airlock door. Frame by frame, it was not a flash as such. On
three consecutive frames, an object moved across the field of view.
Motion blur made it impossible to distinguish details, but it occupied
about ten degrees of arc, making it either vastly bigger than any star -
an unlikely outcome - or quite close to the viewport. Unprecedented, but
unarguable. <P>It could, of course, have been a maintenance EVAV. They were quite
frequent, but if so, they should have been registered with EVA control.
According to the EVA control page, they weren't. No-one had booked out
today. Didn't mean no-one was out there. After all, Tazio himself had
failed to log his own visit to the pod. <P>He had already planned what to do. He risked paying another visit to the
pod with his camera and handheld, and returned later, empty-handed. His
father was still not in his cabin next door, so he started to watch a
movie and fell asleep in his clothes. <P><hr />
<I><b>HTW Iain M Banks</b> to <b>GQ Stanislaw Lem  </b><br />
5024008263632049</I><br /><tt>Did you try that avatar?</tt>
<hr />
<I><b>GQ Stanislaw Lem</b> to <b>HTW Iain M Banks</b><br />
5024008298663535</I><br /><tt>
Yes. It quit sub-ether transmission immediately. No further result so
far. I'll try another in a while. They know I'm here, I think. But we
have to consider alternate strategies if they continue to ignore
us.</tt> <P><hr />
<p class=drop>Kay-Zee heard no more of the android case. It was no
longer, apparently, a police matter. Her questions to Lieutenant Parsons
went unanswered. Further, she was ordered not to communicate any details
of the case to anyone, not even to colleagues. <P>She spent several days investigating thefts from the hydroponic jungle
where all of the food for the ship was grown. It turned out to be an
inside job, a worker trading fresh fruit for illegal alcohol. The
various beer, wine and spirit operations on the ship were tolerated,
rather than authorised, as long as they used waste rather than fresh
food as their ingredients. It had turned out to be impossible to
eradicate man's desire for occasional intoxication. <P>When that was cleared up, Lieutenant Parsons told her to do something
about Tazio. Accordingly, she asked Idoru (who saw everything and said
nothing unless specifically requested) to report any landing pod event.
Being a computer with a literal turn of mind, Idoru accordingly reported
dozens of trivial incidents such as tiny temperature changes or
microscopic analyses of air quality until Kay-Zee specified door
incidents. She hadn't long to wait. Pod K6 again, the port
entry signal accompanied
by an image of Tazio advancing through the airlock. <P>By the time Kay-Zee reached K6 and entered, the pod was empty. Tazio
hadn't been there long. She went immediately to Tazio's cabin, but
no-one answered the door. She returned to HQ and requested a supervisory
view on her vidscreen. The spycam in Tazio's cabin revealed him hunched
over his computer. <P>She got hold of a skeleton card, walked over to Tazio's cabin, and
entered. "Well, the look on your face when I walked in was worth the
trouble I took." <P>"No, look, Kay-Zee. I 've caught a spacecraft on camera. Just a little
one, see." <P>"Yes. You've been caught on camera, too. Entering the landing pod
again. That's it. This time you are going to be dealt with. Lieutenant
Parsons has been in touch with your father, who agreed that you have to
be punished for messing about in the landing pods." <P>"Please, Kay-Zee, I've got the proof. Look at this." <P>Despite herself, Kay-Zee looked at Tazio's screen. It was clearly a
spacecraft, but what a spacecraft! It looked like every boy's dream of a
spacecraft, its basically streamlined body surmounted by blisters, pods,
weaponry, aerials and, especially, insignia - huge black symbols and
numbers on its creamy-coloured hull. <P>"How?" <P>"I put the camera on time delay, taking a frame every fifteen seconds
until the chip was full. I've got ten or more pictures of it, but this
is the best!" <P>"Good try, Tazio. Very realistic. It's a model, right? Now, let's go. We
have an appointment with Lieutenant Parsons." <P>"No, Kay-Zee, it's real! Wait till I show Dad." <P>"In your own time, Tazio. I won't ask again. I seem to spend half my
life chasing after you." <P><p class=drop>Kay-Zee left Tazio with Lieutenant Parsons.  The
Lieutenant had devised what he felt to be a suitable punishment for
Tazio. He was to be given a sharp lecture, then locked up for
twenty-four hours in a landing pod.  Kay-Zee privately considered that
Tazio would regard this as a reward, but she said nothing. She offered
to stay for the interview, but she was near the end of her watch, and by
the next day, a body had turned up, this one impaled on a metal pipe in
recycling. <P>This time, Kay-Zee was first on the scene, with Wally Khan as backup.
Liquid Waste Distribution 1 was an odorous chamber, cold, badly lit and
echoing. A metal pipe ran from a bulkhead into a cylindrical unit, which
presumably separated liquids and gases that flowed into half a dozen
different exit pipes. <div class=pullquote>"You had better make sure
your boy keeps his mouth shut."</div>The apparently male victim,
bland-faced, dressed
in an orange overall, was held in place by the pipe passing through his
abdomen, oozing the jelly she had seen on the android in Bay 17, but it
appeared singularly composed under the circumstances. There was no
conceivable way in which he could have been threaded on to the pipe -
one end of the pipe was attached to the bulkhead, the other to the
processing cylinder. What's more, according to the shocked recycling
tech, the pipe was blocked internally. It was as though the body had
materialised in its current position. Kay-Zee reported via her comm that
it was another android. The android was talking after a fashion, very
quietly. The language was clearly English with a peculiar accent, the
delivery was confused, and the content included a desire to make contact
and offering help of some kind. <P>Kay-Zee switched on her shoulder cam to record as much as possible, but
the flow of words became quieter and more garbled, and, by the time the
lab team arrived to cut the android loose, all signs of animation had
ceased. <P>Even while she and Wally were preparing their report, the lieutenant,
despite the late hour, appeared on site. <P>"No report on this, Kay-Zee, Wally. I have been instructed from the
highest authority to keep the lid on it." <P>"Highest authority?" said Kay-Zee. <P>"The captain, OK? No reports. No discussion with colleagues, family,
friends. Forget it. Completely." <P>"Got it," said Wally. <P>"Got it. But what is it? Some experiment?" said Kay-Zee. <P>"When I said 'No Discussion', it includes asking me. In fact, I have no
idea. Unlike you, I obey orders. Can I impress on you that it's a
secret, and no-one needs to know." <P>"Aye, aye, sir." <P><p class=drop>But, of course, Captain Raymond needed to know, and what
he knew or suspected was that aliens were attempting to invade the ship,
probably to kill everyone, and certainly to divert the Mustang Sally
from her objective. The following morning, he was impressing the need
for secrecy on his second-in-command, Commander Rydell. <P>Rydell was not so sure: "But, Captain, there are scores of people who
know part of the story already. The police, half of the lab staff,
Navigation. And here's the worst. That craft Navigation detected? My son
managed to take photographs of it." <P>"What?" <P>"It's OK. I convinced him it was a scout ship of our own. Top secret.
He'll not tell anyone." <P>"Good" <P>"Tazio is just one witness. Rumours are already circulating, sir. Tazio
was just outside Bay 17 when the first android was discovered. Now we've
had a second. And the same Master-at-Arms was present at both. She
even videoed the second one. We extracted it, and the lab are checking
it out. It's deleted from the mainframe. But we can't
keep it confidential much longer. What we can understand of the
android's message seems peaceful." <P>"No, no. They'd be sure to tell us that. For all we know, they've
already invaded Earth. We may be the only hope for mankind. If they
were actually human, they'd have sent a human emissary, not a robot
pretending to be a human. In any
event, there would be panic on board. Just think. Their technology must
be
vastly superior to ours. Look how they completely ignored that missile.
There are thousands on the Mustang who expect to spend the rest of their
days in relative peace. Including me. How would they react if these
aliens suddenly appeared among them?" <P>"I think they'd handle it pretty well, if they were warned in advance.
They don't get much excitement in the normal course of events." <P>"No, Commander, I think there's a good chance these aliens will lose
interest if we don't react. It's just a small craft. We are huge. They
have no idea what we're capable of." <P>"Not a lot, from the military point of view, sir." <P>"Granted. But they don't know that. It's not worth their while to
challenge us." <P>"It encourages me that they send humanoid robots that speak English.
That doesn't sound unfriendly." <P>"That's enough, Commander. You have my orders and you had better make
sure your boy keeps his mouth shut. No-one is to speak of it.
Understand?" <P>"Aye-aye, sir." The expression 'Aye-aye', infrequently used these days,
had come to mean 'I obey, but I don't like it'. If Captain Raymond
noticed the potential insubordination, he made no sign of it. <P><hr />

5024008298663537</I><br /><tt>I'll keep hovering around. They can't be
human if they don't get curious about me.</tt>  <hr /> <P><p class=drop>Tazio was, as Kay-Zee predicted, entirely comfortable in
the landing pod. It was hardly a prison. Had he chosen, Tazio could have
used his experience with pod electronics to escape. Instead, he
opened the viewport, sat in the pilot's chair, and searched the
firmament for spacecraft. He had just perceived a twinkling reflection
at extreme distance, when he heard a woman's voice behind him. He swung
around and jumped up with a guilty start. Surely Kay-Zee hadn't followed
him here. But it wasn't Kay-Zee. He had never seen her before. She was
tall, thin, dark-haired, dressed in a simple one-piece overall. <P>At first, he couldn't make out what she was saying. A strange accent, he
couldn't quite... <P>"What did you say?" <P>"My name is Lem. What's yours?" <P>"I.. I.. Tazio Rydell? What are you doing here?" <P>"What is your age, Tazio?" <P>"I'm fifteen. Who are you? I don't think you should be here. I'm
supposed to be locked in." He was not precisely alarmed, but confused
and worried. <P>"I need to speak to your captain. Can you take me there?" <P>"No. I'm not allowed out. Well, I could, but I'd be in trouble. If
you've got a key to get in, you can get out again. I haven't got a key." <P>"I haven't got a key either." <P>"Well, did someone lock you in, like me?" <P>"I didn't come in by the door." <P>"It's the only way." <P>"No, it's not." <P>Tazio began to suspect the woman was deranged, like the mother of one of
his school friends, who had run around the corridors with a
knife screaming that the devil was inside her, until she was led off to
the hospital. Deranged people, he had heard, could be dangerous. There
was no other way into a landing pod. "How did you get in, then?" <P>"I was displaced. From another spacecraft." <P>"The little one that I've seen? What is 'displaced'?" Input overload. <P>"It's a method of moving an object from one location to another by... by
a complicated method using quantum physics." She pointed out of the
viewport. The craft Tazio had photographed was holding position nearby.
"I'm from that one. It would be more true to say I <i>am</i> that
craft. The Stanislaw Lem. The Lem has no crew as such. It is operated
by an AI. I am the avatar of that AI, a robot which has the
personality of that AI." <P>"An AI - Artificial Intelligence! There are games about AIs." <P>"Are there really?" <P>"I can call my father. I'm allowed to do that." <P>"Who is your father?" <P>"He's a Commander. He works for Captain Raymond." <P>"Your father sounds exactly the person I should speak to. Can you call
him now?" <P><hr /> <I><b>GQ Stanislaw Lem</b> to <b>HTW Iain M Banks</b><br />
5024008298663538</I><br /><tt>Success! Or, at least, so far so good. I
have an avatar aboard the Mustang Sally. A male juvenile was inside one
of the landing/rescue units with the viewport open. With visibility, I
was able to displace an avatar into the unit without hazard. The avatar
took the form of an adult female. I thought that would cause less alarm.
In the event, the child was quite sophisticated and has called the
authorities on board.</tt> <P><hr /> <I><b>HTW Iain M Banks</b>

<tt>Well done. Keep me posted. Don't mention me until you have to.
Remember what happened with Blue Suede Shoes. Don't
reveal our full purpose until you're sure they won't panic.</tt> <hr /> <P><I><b>GQ Stanislaw Lem</b> to <b>HTW Iain M Banks</b><br />
5024008298663539</I><br /><tt>Yes. As agreed. We assert that we are here
to help if they need it, with stores, repairs, medical assistance. </tt>
<hr /> <P><p class=drop>Captain Raymond was looking haggard. Two weeks of
conversation with Lem, or, rather, with the avatar of Stanislaw Lem and
still he
didn't trust it. "I know you have been very helpful over these last few
weeks, and we thank you. These repairs and the updated electronics
will prove very useful. One thing puzzles me." <P>"And that is?" <P>"You know very well that you have constantly avoided explaining why you
are here, apparently alone." <P>Commander Rydell added "He's right. You say you came from Earth, yet
there are no human personnel with you. And the Stanislaw Lem is too
small to have sourced all the equipment and the robots that converted
the shield to a force field." <P>"I had expected to explain all this to you in due course. I have been
advised to be cautious in what I reveal." <P>"Why? Is there some hidden agenda here, as I suspect? said Raymond. <P><div class=pullquote>"You should know that Earth is no longer
inhabited."</div>"By no means. It's just that we approached another
Earth star ship in a
less than diplomatic fashion, causing considerable distress to them, and
precipitating what amounted to panic, then what amounted to civil war
within the ship. A particularly extreme faction 
eventually forced the ship to self-destruct with the loss of all the
colonists." <P>"I see you used the expression 'we'. And that is supposed to reassure
us?" <P>"I feel it would be a terrible shock to you and your people if I were to
announce everything I have to say in public." <P>"Well," said Rydell, "The whole ship now knows you are here. There have
been guided tours to see the Stanislaw Lem from Tazio's viewport. Many
of the crew have now met you. I think you can, at any rate, depend on
the good impression you have made, except that you adroitly avoid any
discussion of your origin and intentions." <P>"Answering your questions in what I consider to be the appropriate
order, I shall be more open with you. I hope I have proved my good
intentions, and you must trust that I shall continue to speak and act in
your best interests." <P>"I suspect you <I>would</I> say that, whatever your motives. I have
never fully trusted you," grumbled Raymond. <P>"I agree with the Captain," said Rydell, "I was more prepared to trust
you at first than I am now. You must be aware that your adopted persona,
as an open, attractive and friendly female, has tended to turn away
hostility and suspicion in a way a male avatar might not have done." <P>Lem smiled. "All right. This may be a shock, though probably not a
surprise. You should know that Earth is no
longer inhabited. Its climatic collapse was expected before you left on
this mission.
Indeed that fear was the main reason for the star ships." <P>"And I suppose everyone is dead," said Raymond. <P>"Not so. The vast majority were re-housed in a suitable space habitat in
approximate Earth orbit. There were casualties; stay-behinds, panickers,
rioters, people too sick to survive, but most are safe and have been
settled for half a century. We arranged the necessary transport." <P>"A space habitat?" asked Rydell. <P>"Effectively a planet, but a different, more convenient shape. A ring,
rather than a sphere. I can offer details, but I have more news." <P>"What now?" <P>"I am, as you correctly guessed, not alone. We are accompanied at a
distance by what you might call
a mother ship, a Heavy Transport Workshop called Iain M Banks. The Banks
is mother to a thousand or more smaller vehicles, of which the Lem is
the smallest type. The docking hold alone of the Banks is large enough
to accommodate several craft as big as the Mustang Sally. It carries
armaments that could vaporise a planet. Indeed, the sight of Iain M
Banks caused the initial uproar in the generation ship Blue Suede Shoes.
Therefore, we
decided, on this occasion, to conduct a modest approach." <P>Commander Rydell looked dubious. "I don't believe Earth technology can
have advanced so far." <P>"You are correct. The race that created us a very long time ago were not
human. We AIs are effectively their descendants. They are not extinct;
some are aboard the Iain M Banks, as are a few hundred humans. But none
of them take any part in guiding our operations. This particular fleet
is dedicated to the well-being of the human race. It is a kind of hobby.
Every craft is named after an Earth-origin science fiction author." <P>"So you've been running around helping all the generation ships?" <P>"Most, I'm afraid, were beyond our help by the time we found them, but
yes." <P>"So you will nursemaid us to our destination?" asked Captain Raymond.  <P>"If you wish, but we have other proposals to offer you." <P>"I'm not sure I like the idea of any change to our mission." <P>"Even although its original purpose, to preserve the human species, has
been achieved with the space habitat? You could turn around and return
home. Alternatively, you could abandon the Mustang Sally and load your
crew on the Iain M Banks, which is essentially a world in itself. I can
assure you of a full and attractive	life for all your people." <P>Raymond did not hesitate. "My orders were clear. The duty of every
successive captain is to preserve the ship until it reaches its
destination, and then to colonise the planet we reach. What would we do
otherwise?" <P>"Then, if I tell you that the planet you currently appear to target,
which may have been superficially suitable when viewed by Earth
telescopes, is not, it fact, a viable colonisation planet, what will you
do?" <P>"If we so determine, we have a list of alternate destinations. We simply
collect what water and minerals we require from the asteroids
and moons of the star system we have reached and redirect to another
destination, however long it takes. The ship and its mission are
essentially immortal, even if we individuals are not." <P>"Wait a minute," said Rydell, "With your technology, we could reach our
destination much more quickly!" <P>"You anticipate our offer. In principle, we could load the Mustang Sally
aboard the
Banks, and convey it to a suitable deserted planet within a few months." <P>Raymond exploded. "Under no circumstances! That is not what we are here
for!" <P>"Oh, it's a great offer, Captain," said Rydell. "Think. You could be the
man who starts the colony. Something you never even hoped for." <P>"Neither hoped for nor wished!" <P>Lem said quietly: "This is what we feared. It was clear that most of the
crew of the Blue Suede Shoes found the change to their expected
existence and lifespan too much to comprehend. The result was chaos,
aggravated by the fact that discipline on board was much inferior to
your own." <P>"Please," said Raymond, "Leave us alone to continue our mission. It was
generous of you to offer assistance, but we do not need it." <P>"As you wish, Captain, but may I offer the following compromise? We
could convey the Mustang Sally to within, say, 30 years travel at your
current capability, from a suitable planet. Further, we would offer to
accommodate on Iain M Banks a number of your crew to supervise the early
terraforming of the colony, and convey them there to anticipate your
arrival. This would save many generations of your people the drudgery
and continued risk of your slow approach to the new colony, while
averting the psychological upheaval that would be occasioned by doing
the journey all at once." <P>Raymond was silent. <P>
<p class=drop>Fleet Auxiliary Doctor E E Smith, on indefinite loan from
HTW Iain M Banks, orbited the green and blue sphere that was to become a
new home for mankind. Lieutenant Kay-Zee Jones, chief police officer on
the	Smith, was still having trouble with Tazio, who, armed with
wonderful devices beyond even his fantastic dreams, managed to irritate
the serious-minded terraforming crew. His latest prank had been to
release a swarm of tiny flying eyes which penetrated every corner of the
ship and relayed live video to his handheld. E E, the AI that was the
guiding
personality of the E E Smith quickly disposed of them with a spray of
tiny laser cannons. Kay-Zee was irritated that E E had clearly been
amused by Tazio's game, and was further inhibited from serious action by
the fact that his father, Captain Rydell, was the senior human officer
aboard. <P>Having taken this momentous step, to break away from the Mustang Sally
with a crew of forward-looking personnel, she reflected that life was
not going to be all that different after all. <P> <P><small>&copy; Gil Williamson 2014 All Rights Reserved </small>
