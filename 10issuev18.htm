<div><i>No battle plan survives contact with the
enemy<br><small>Helmuth von Moltke</small></i>
<p class="drop">White-out. <P>We faced a whirlwind of powdered snow but my head-up display provided
both topographical overlay and passive infrared. Ahead of us lay frozen
lake, the
snow-covered shoreline, and some bare trees. Sergeant Lovell was on
point, receiving feedback from the frontrunner surveillance drones,
checking the ice
was thick enough to bear our weight. We were in full carapace rig plus
tactical weapons load - weighing in at a spit under 2000 pounds apiece.
Approaching
the enemy position at Madras Point across the lake certainly fell under
the heading of 'unexpected', but one false step and we'd end up as
permanent
residents. <P>The Sarge stopped and raised a fist. As one the other seven of us
halted, lapsing into 'ready' stance 3. Of course he could have simply
spoken to us over
the tight-band, but Lovell was strictly old-school when it came to
battlefield comms. Plus I knew he didn't buy the 'easy-in, easy-out'
mission profile
that Major Sondheim had been peddling. <P>The indentured workforce on Pendragon Minor had rioted, taking the
MidasCorp management hostage. Nobody had been seriously hurt but the new
'Workers'
Soviet' wanted a flat-rate wage increase and better living conditions,
or things would turn nasty. Someone in the corporate hierarchy wanted to
make a
point, so now eight over-armed Marines were going to overwhelm a bunch
of
ordinary Joes in the name of labour relations. Man, the cost of our
deployment
alone would have paid for everything the peons were demanding and then
some. Go figure. <P>Sargeant Lovell gestured and the squad echeloned left. I had my external
mic on even though the shrill wind made the suit interior feel chilly.
Call me
optimistic, but I figured the sound of cracking ice would give me enough
time to blow the rig apart and escape. I trusted the drone tech, but
only so far. <P>We maintained a steady pace; that loping, stylised gait you get with
powered armour. Even if someone <i>had</i> been looking in our direction
the mimetic
camo would turn us into a white-on-white blur amidst the snow swirls.
Anyway we'd been told the opposition had zero tech; a few pistols and
shotguns looted
from the Police barracks, but that was all. <P>The Sarge stopped, frozen in place. <P>As Corporal I halted the squad. Suit malfunctions were extremely rare
but not unknown. I half-smiled to myself; if the Sarge had to be evac'd
by a recovery
lifter then he'd tear someone in Maintenance a new one. <P>I spotted vapour condensing around the back of his helmet and upped my
display magnification. There was a small hole there; smooth, not jagged.
I'd never
known a suit go bad like that. A bunch of command icons appeared in my
peripheral vision. The ice ahead of me was now shown in shades of green. <P>New batter up. <P>I took a deep breath. "Squad, this is Cooper. The Sarge is down. I
repeat, the Sarge is down. Looks like a sniper, single-shot,
high-velocity. I'm in
command. Alpha team, stand fast. I want suppressive fire on the shore,
directly ahead, along the crest of the rise. Bravo team, with me.
Weapons free,
weapons free." <P>There was no back-chat, no queries. The Sarge was gone. You couldn't
triage a man in carapace; if command and control had devolved to me it
was because his
suit biometrics had tanked. The built-in medical systems would do what
they could, but for now it was all about dealing with the immediate
threat. <P>The three remaining members of Alpha adopted the 'brace' stance, raised
their weapons, and opened fire. We were all carrying miniguns - and not
the usual
squad support weapon but its 9mm big brother. Sustained fire turned
fifty metres of shoreline into a maelstrom of earth, snow and shattered
tree-trunks. <P>I led Bravo onward, aiming to reach the shore maybe a 100 metres left of
the target zone. Not that I thought flanking fire would be required but,
back
then, I did things by the book. The temptation to up the pace was almost
overwhelming but the drones could only move so fast. <P>The icon for McGuire - Alpha 2 - blinked red. My rig had defaulted to
full squad monitoring rather than the 'eyes only' approach favoured by
Sergeant
Lovell. A glance behind showed coolant burbling from McGuire's
breastplate and the spark of a ruptured power cell. <P>The ice ahead of me flared red. <P>"Bravo, halt!" <P>A figured it for a sub-surface thermal detonation, the result being a
band of paper-thin ice stretching in either direction as far as the
drones could
detect. I swore. "Jorgovic, Peters, suppressive fire, increase target
zone thirty meters left. Ingersoll, thickening fire-" <P>"I'm hit!" <P>Ingersoll's right arm drooped; vapour venting from a neat hole in the
shoulder plate. My remaining guys opened up, full auto, but we were
pissing in the
wind. The sniper had indirect eyes on us and was probably firing from
behind - and through - the snowbank directly ahead. We were targets in a
shooting
gallery, nothing more. <P>I knew when I was beat. "Lazy Gun Actual this is Lazy Gun Two, request
immediate fire support. Over." <P>Lieutenant Hawks came back straight at me. "Lazy Gun Two this is Actual.
Cooper? What the hell is happening out there?" <P>"The Sarge is down, L-T, same for McGuire and Ingersoll. Sniper fire.
Hyper-kinetic rounds that can punch clean through our rig. We have no
eyes, I repeat,
no eyes on the shooter. The ice ahead has been compromised and we cannot
close on his likely position." Falling back didn't occur to me. <P>"Jesus, Coop, thanks for spoiling my day. OK, what do you want?" <P>"I figure the bad guy is on the far-side of the ridge." I shouldered my
weapon and engaged the laser designator. "I need an area fire mission
centred
twenty, two-zero, metres from the transmitted co-ordinates, bearing
one-three-zero." <P>"Negative on the fire mission, Corporal, you know we've nothing in
orbit." <P>The icon for Edwards - Alpha 3 - blinked red. My first command was
turning to shit. I didn't feel afraid, or frustrated or even
disappointed - I didn't
feel anything at all. "Just lost Edwards. Gimme something, L-T, or none
of us are getting off the ice." <P>"Lazy Gun Two, wait one." <P>I felt like a spare wheel, standing there while the guys blazed away. A
100-metre stretch of shoreline was now shrouded in our man-made blizzard
but it was
obvious we were facing advanced tech, and then some. <P>"Bastard!" Peters stopped firing; the ammo feed to his weapon had been
severed. Exposed rounds dropped to the ice, covered in a tracery of blue
static
discharge. <P>"Lazy Gun Two this is Actual. Cooper, take cover. Midas-" the rest was
lost in a <i>scree</i> of electronic gibberish. All my long-range icons
went dark. <P>Take cover? There wasn't so much as a fucking reed sticking out of the
ice. "Squad! Squad, cease fire and hunker down. Whatever they got
coming, it's
coming now." <P>We dropped to one knee; 'at rest' stance 2. I doubted it would make much
difference. <P>White light. <P>My display flared out then slowly adjusted. Heavy polarisation turned
the world monochrome. We were just inside a huge circle of radiant
brilliance. It was
shrinking rapidly; concentrating, increasing in intensity. <P>Focusing. <P><i>"Sweet Jesus." </i>
The beam narrowed to a searing column centred on a point just beyond the
ridge. I screwed my eyes shut even before visual shut down due to
overload. I
heard cries and curses from the other men. <P>The orbital ion cannon fired. <P>There was a moment of utter silence. <P>Then the shock wave roared over us; a banshee of pulverised snow and
earth. Ice rippled and cracked beneath my feet. I felt my boots slide
despite the
crampons. Visually I reached for the 'Eject' icon and if the Sarge had
still been in command I might have considered it. As it was I couldn't
just bail and
dump this shit on someone else. <P>The blizzard died, visual systems rebooted. We were all still there. <P>I stood up. The cannon was used to smash rock formations, part of the
open-cast mining operation they had going here. We were just damn lucky
the impact
crater hadn't extended as far as the shoreline or we'd be surfing on ice
floes. My long-range comms returned as upper-atmosphere ionisation faded
away. <P>"Lazy Gun Two this is Actual. You boys still in one piece, Cooper?" <P>"Actual this is Lazy Gun Two. I got three viable, two walking-wounded
and three unknown. You want us to push on, L-T? Not sure how long it'll
take to find
a way off the ice though." <P>"Negative, negative, the mission is scrubbed. Looks like the cannon had
the desired effect and the opposition are now talking about talks, or
some shit
like that. Stand-fast and await evac." He sighed, "Bad day all round,
Cooper." <P>"No lie, L-T, no lie. Cooper out." <P>We checked on each other. Ingersoll was a through-and-through flesh
wound, Edwards and Peters just systems failures. But Sargeant Lovell and
McGuire, man,
they were gone. <P>It took ten minutes or so for the anti-grav masslifter to reach our
location. Civilian, as a combat helo couldn't lift carapace and a
dropship would have
shattered the ice with its down-blast. We attached lifting cables to the
dead so their kit could be salvaged back at base. Plus it looked better
bringing
them home as warriors than in the crappy environmental bodysuits we wore
under full rig. <P>I was last aboard, port side, and we'd started rising, taking up the
cable slack, when I remembered the goddam drones. They'd probably dock
my pay if I
left them out on the ice so I started hunting through the command
interface for 'auto return' or similar. <P>The surface-to-air struck us starboard side, exploded. <P>I fell, the rig registering multiple frontal hits. External vison
failed. Systems started flickering between 'Standby' and 'Wait' -
obviously falling
through the air wasn't something the designers had anticipated. <P><i>"Warning, proximity alert. Warning-"</i> <P>Impact. <P><p class="drop">Then it was later. <P>I'm not sure how much later as the mission timer, comms - shit, just
about everything - was off-line. What I had left was pretty much in
solid back-up
territory but suit integrity was OK and I could still move, still fight.
Visual looked damn weird until I realised I was seeing the world via the
surviving
drones. Apparently my rig was smart enough to come up with its own
workaround. But outside was all bad news. <P>The masslifter had come down on a rocky outcrop some distance offshore.
The whole forward section was submerged and what wasn't was burning. As
I watched
an armoured figure emerged from the inferno and got as far from the
flames as he could without quitting solid ground. The surrounding ice
was obviously
compromised and unable to take his weight. I saw warning lights blink
and then the carapace sections fell away. Vaughn stepped out of the
remains and
started picking his way over the fractured lake, heading for the
treeline. I guess he felt freezing to death was preferable to slowly
roasting, and a snow
hole might keep him alive until rescue arrived. <P>His head exploded. <P>It's the vacuum trail of a hyper-velocity round that does the damage; it
punches clean through and sucks out brain, blood and bone in its wake.
The torso
toppled over and disappeared through a hole in the ice. <P>I sat up then stood. My head was still way below the top of the snow
bank I'd landed it, so it had kept me alive in more ways than one. The
sniper out
there was obviously a pro, and pros have patience. However he had to be
firing from a spot much further back than I'd originally estimated,
meaning he'd be
completely dependent on remote feed. The good news; he'd never spot me
outside his augmented field of vision. The bad news; I still didn't know
where the
bastard was holed up. <P>Still, I figured he'd crossed me off his list as by rights I should have
been at the bottom of the lake. Gambling his attention was still
focused on the
wreck and the immediate surroundings I started snow-ploughing my way
inland. Eventually the ground sloped up and I emerged into a belt of
evergreens, with
the impact crater way off to my right. I paused for a moment and gave
myself a visual once-over. Blast damage and shrapnel had scoured the
front of my rig,
meaning the mimetic camo was a no-go. From behind I looked like blurry
pine branches but unless I snuck-up on the sniper ass-first it was now
down to
old-school fieldcraft. <P>Study the terrain, shift position from concealment to concealment, keep
low, move fast. <P>Well, keeping low was out and the best I could manage through waist-deep
snow was a laborious surge, but nobody shot me when I moved and that's a
success
in my book. It took maybe fifteen minutes to work my way around the edge
of the crater so that I was coming at Madras Point from the inland side.
I figured
that with us dropping off the grid Lieutenant Hawks would want to scare
up some eyes-on before making his next move. Not that he had much left
to work with
apart from a few flight crew and support techs. <P>I pressed on, needing a break - and the gods of Karma smiled on me. <P>Tracks in the snow; two individuals moving one behind the other, heading
towards the mining facility. I started trailing them while keeping to
whatever
cover was on offer. Of course I was depending on the enemy surveillance
- probably drones or landworms - remaining focused on the lake approach.
Powered
armour is designed to be big, bulky and intimidating, so a stealthy
ninja I was not. <P>Up ahead I saw a branch bend and snap back into position, all on its
own. A voice laughed out of nowhere. I had nothing, not even passive
infrared. I'd be
firing blind and it took my minigun 3.2 seconds to spin-up - which is a
fucking eternity when the bad guy has a weapon that could stop a tank.
Even
assuming it was a heavyweight piece usually fired from a tripod we'd be
in a wintry version of High Noon; a slow-mo gunfight with no prize for
second
place. As I was getting nothing from enhanced vision I shut down the
feed and opened my visor. Jesus it was cold, like the slap you get from
a walk-in
freezer. I felt the internal neck seal tighten, keeping the rest of my
body within an environmental cocoon. <P>I latched my primary weapon into carry mode and reached for the
breaching tool both NCO's carried on this mission. It was a stubby
shotgun firing shaped
charges - designed to blow entry points in walls. Hardly the most subtle
weapon but I'll take 'indiscriminate' over 'aimed' any day. I brought it
to my
shoulder and marched on, no longer trying to hide, intent on closing the
range as quickly as possible. The only sounds were the rhythmic crunch
of snow and
my shallow breathing. Ice crystals began to form along the rim of my
faceplate. <P>A blur on the ridgeline against a backdrop of low cloud. Maybe
interference between two stealth fields in close proximity. Adjusted my
aim, fired, zero
recoil. Dropped the shotgun. <P>Up ahead an explosion, scream. A man-shape covered in St. Elmo's Fire. A
man falling, bloody. <P>The minigun winding up. Time to take a breath. Shots impacting on my
breastplate; small-calibre shit, no worries. Green light, <i>fire</i>. <P>The dragon roars, spews a torrent of tracer. <P>Helmet hit, ricochet, sparks around my head. <P><i>"Warning, systems fail-"</i> <P><p class="drop">Burning, but cold. It was dark. Not a place I wanted to
be. Someone
whispering&#8230; <P>"Stim him again, I want this man walking the line." <P>"Sorry, L-T, but the rig won't play ball. Needs Medical Officer
authorisation to exceed the max safe dose." <P>"Dammit, do it manually. Christ, stop pussyfooting about, just give it
here." <P>A hand brushed my face. The pulse-and-numb of a single-shot gas
injector. Hammer-blow to the heart. Drowning; you either rise to the
surface or sink
without trace. <P>I threw up, coughed. <i>"Get the fuck away from me!"</i> <P>"That's 'Get the fuck away from me, <i>Sir'!</i>" Lieutenant Hawks
laughed, "Less of your malingering, Cooper, you ain't dead yet." <P>I blinked, looked about. The rig had defaulted to 'at ease' and my
helmet had been removed. The L-T and two Marines were around me, another
two on guard.
All pretty much anonymous in cold-weather gear but I recognised
Henderson from his shades - real fly-boy cool. <P>Servos whined as I stood upright. I tried to salute but couldn't move my
right arm, couldn't see from my right eye. "Corporal Gary Cooper
reporting for
duty, Sir." <P>"Stand down, Marine, we won. You wasted that pair in full view of the
workforce and they caved in, double-time. The hostages have been
released and both
sides are trying to act like nothing happened." <P>"Nothing happened? Jesus, L-T, we lost seven men out on the ice, plus
the flight crew. That's gotta count for something." <P>He shook his head. "I hear ya, Marine, I surely do. This whole thing has
been an exercise in inter-corporate shit-stirring but, officially, the
mission is
a success. That means our casualties are <i>acceptable</i>, Corporal. Do
we understand each other?" <P>"Sir." <P>He nodded to the two techs dicking with my rig, "Get him operational.
He's walking out of here as a Marine ready for combat, not just some
survivor in his
skivvies." <P>Lieutenant Hawks moved away, being replaced in my field of vision by
Specialist Brannigan. The tech grinned. "Command are already riding the
L-T's ass over
this, Coop. They want a goddam <i>hero</i>, front-and-centre. So
remember to smile nice while chowing down on all the public relations
bullshit. Damn, they
might even promote you." <P>I groaned. "Aw hell, why me?" <P>"Last man standing, bro, last man standing." <P>Ain't that the truth. <P><small>&copy; Martin M. Clark 2016 All Rights Reserved </small>
